When you look at a list of functions in the global<br>&gt;&gt;   namespace, seeing fifty instances of `func +` is not helpful.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; * Type checker speed.  Having all of these overloads around has<br>&gt;&gt;   historically put a strain on the type checker and made compilation<br>&gt;&gt;   slow.  That may be less true today than it once was, though.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; These are both completely understandable concerns (especially the type<br>&gt; checker speed, since I&#39;ve hit the &quot;expression too complex&quot; problem in<br>&gt; a couple odd places myself). I&#39;m hoping though that we can converge on<br>&gt; a solution other than &quot;pollute the public interface of a type with<br>&gt; named methods that duplicate the operators, which are trampolines to<br>&gt; those methods&quot;, since I think that actually detracts from the user<br>&gt; experience of using that type.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Would something like this be possible? Imagine protocols defined like this:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    public protocol Equatable {<br>&gt;        static func == (lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -&gt; Self<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt;    public protocol FloatingPoint: Equatable {<br>&gt;        static func + (lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -&gt; Self<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This would have the effect of automatically generating the following<br>&gt; generic trampoline global operators:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    public func == &lt;T: Equatable&gt;(lhs: T, rhs: T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;        return T.==(lhs, rhs)<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt;    public func + &lt;T: FloatingPoint&gt;(lhs: T, rhs: T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;        return T.+(lhs, rhs)<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Then, types that conform to FloatingPoint would define the method as<br>&gt; appropriate:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    public struct Double: FloatingPoint {<br>&gt;        public static func == (lhs: Double, rhs: Double) -&gt; Double { ... }<br>&gt;        public static func + (lhs: Double, rhs: Double) -&gt; Double { ... }<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If something like this worked, it has a number of advantages:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; * It has the same lower overhead with respect to the global namespace<br>&gt; as the currently proposed strategy that uses an explicitly defined<br>&gt; generic operator that trampolines to a named add() method. This should<br>&gt; keep type checking fast and keeps the number of global instances of<br>&gt; the operator low.<br>&gt; * It increases consistency: the operator requirement is declared in<br>&gt; the protocol, and the concrete implementation is *in* the conforming<br>&gt; type (as opposed to a separate global function).<br>&gt; * There is no need to introduce arbitrarily named methods to implement<br>&gt; the operations that would pollute the public interface of the type.<br>&gt; * It doesn&#39;t affect the ability to pass operators as first-class<br>&gt; functions into other algorithms (like + into reduce). In fact, if an<br>&gt; algorithm needs to be explicit about the types (if they can&#39;t be<br>&gt; inferred for some reason), then for example `Float.+` would refer to<br>&gt; the appropriate `(Float, Float) -&gt; Float` function.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Some might argue that implicitly defining the generic global operator<br>&gt; under the covers is a drawback to this approach, but I think that&#39;s a<br>&gt; minor concern when weighed against the alternatives.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Individual elements of the syntax could be debated (an &quot;operator&quot;<br>&gt; keyword instead of &quot;static func&quot;? But that might just be syntactic<br>&gt; sugar), but overall, I&#39;d love to get feedback on the feasibility of an<br>&gt; approach like this. I&#39;m happy to take a stab at drawing this up in a<br>&gt; proposal, as well.<br></p><p>Hi Tony,<br></p><p>As you can see in the notes from April 27, 2016 language review, the<br>core team discussed this.
