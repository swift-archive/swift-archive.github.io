Is something like that at all possible?<br></p><p>When I look at the changes required, this looks like a massive readability regression - especially given that AnyHashable is pretty much a hack around incomplete existential support anyway:<br></p><p>&gt;    let _ = NSError(domain: &quot;myDomain&quot;, code: 4, <br>&gt; -                  userInfo: [&quot;a&quot;:1,&quot;b&quot;:2,&quot;c&quot;:3])<br>&gt; +                  userInfo: [AnyHashable(&quot;a&quot;):1,<br>&gt; +                             AnyHashable(&quot;b&quot;):2,<br>&gt; +                             AnyHashable(&quot;c&quot;):3])<br></p><p>The proposal itself claims that &quot;AnyHashable itself is additive. Source-breaking changes are discussed in SE-0116.”, but that is not true. I don’t see any discussion of these source-breaking changes in SE-0116 - which in fact delegates discussion of the specific AnyHashable design back to this proposal.<br></p><p>Karl<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160727/fe8cb4de/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
