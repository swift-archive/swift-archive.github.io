FWIW, &quot;omit needless words&quot; isn&#39;t something we just came<br>&gt; up with ourselves: it&#39;s a time-honored principle of clear English<br>&gt; writing (google it).<br></p><p>Sure, sure, but if you’ll forgive a cheap shot I’d point out Strunk would’ve tut-tutted here and suggested, perhaps, “we didn’t invent ‘omit needless words’”. The tricky part of that rule is that what’s needless is highly contextual, and to be *understood* when writing in a highly-condensed style usually requires a large amount of shared context.<br></p><p>Which need-for-context is at the root of my admittedly-vague concern; I’ve done my best to come up with a concrete-ish example, but it’s a bit contrived and not as strong as I’d like, either. It’s more of an &quot;ecosystem concern”, too.<br></p><p>Here are *six* functions that could conceivably be named `min` under the guidelines:<br></p><p>func min() -&gt; Generator.Element? // obviously only where `Generator.Element` is `Comparable`<br>func min(isLessThan comparator: (Generator.Element,Generator.Element) -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Generator.Element?<br>func min&lt;K:Comparable&gt;(extractor: (Generator.Element) -&gt; K) -&gt; K?<br>func min&lt;K:Comparable&gt;(extractor: (Generator.Element) -&gt; K?) -&gt; K?<br>func min&lt;T&gt;(extractor: (Generator.Element) -&gt; T, isLessThan comparator: (T,T) -&gt; Bool) -&gt; T?<br>func min&lt;T&gt;(extractor: (Generator.Element) -&gt; T?, isLessThan comparator: (T,T) -&gt; Bool) -&gt; T?<br></p><p>…and perhaps they *all* should be named `min` (and we simply let context and type information sort it all out for us).<br></p><p>But if the names should be different, what’re good choices?<br></p><p>My vague concern is that having “maximally-terse” names for the standard library functions makes it trickier to choose &quot;non-misleading” names for such closely-related variants.<br></p><p>EG: if you go with `minValue` for the variants, to a casual reader there’s room for confusion vis-a-vis `min` (I suspect many would initially guess that `minValue` does what `minElement` does today, but would guess the behavior correctly if given a choice between `minElement` and `minValue`).<br></p><p>Unfortunately for my case, I think `minFor` is a perfectly-reasonable choice here, which undermines my concrete example (I warned you the case wasn’t going to be very convincing).<br></p><p>But that’s the kind of vague concern I have here: that a “maximally-terse” naming convention can be harder to extend in a way that’s both self-consistent and not-potentially-misleading. <br></p><p>But I don’t have a great suggestion for an additional guideline, and there may be nothing serious to worry about here, either.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; -Dave<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160126/ba42ae0a/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
