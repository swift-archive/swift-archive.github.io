This was well received as it removed the<br>disliked &#39;pyramid of doom&#39; - lots of nested indented if statements.<br></p><p>I&#39;d like to propose using the semi-colon to pack if lets and regular ifs<br>into one if. The format would essentially be:<br>if &lt;boolean expression&gt;; let x = x as? Foo; &lt;boolean expression&gt;; let y =<br>x.&lt;property&gt;, z = y.&lt;property&gt; // and so on<br>{<br>  // closure which only happens if both expressions are true and all three<br>bindings happen; note that the last two are comma-separated as they&#39;re both<br>&#39;if let&#39;s.<br>}<br></p><p>There would only be one actual &#39;if&#39;. The semi-colon<br>This would also be applicable to guard and guard let. I&#39;ve had a number of<br>occasions where I&#39;ve written multiple guard statements with identical else<br>closures. I&#39;d like to avoid some of that duplicate code.<br></p><p>I realise that it&#39;s already possible to combine conditions and conditional<br>bindings in one if, using the &#39;where&#39; keyword, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s clear<br>- certainly not as clear as when where filters for-in ranges or case<br>statements.<br></p><p>For example: getting the first element from an array of optionals. Here&#39;s<br>my sample trivial example:<br></p><p>var array : [Int?] = []<br></p><p>if let x = array[0] where array.count &gt; 0<br></p><p>{<br></p><p>print(x)<br></p><p>}<br>This code doesn&#39;t work. The array index is out of range. But there&#39;s no way<br>I know of to rearrange the &#39;if&#39; to ensure the array isn&#39;t empty before<br>binding to the first element - the developer has to write a nested if<br>statement.<br></p><p>My suggested syntax would present the if like this:<br></p><p>if array.count &gt; 0;<br></p><p>let x = array[0]<br></p><p>{<br></p><p>print(x)<br></p><p>}<br></p><p>The semi-colon would read as &#39;and&#39; in the same way the comma does in a<br>multiple if let or &amp;&amp; does in an if; it allows the developer to alternate<br>between boolean expressions and conditional bindings. (The downside here is<br>that three distinct punctuation symbols are all essentially used to mean<br>the same thing.)<br></p><p>Is this worthy of discussion?<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160203/350b59b7/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4fe988326eed161b989d0c5521cb105?s=50"></div><header><strong>A use for semi-colons: alternating between if and if let</strong> from <string>Jordan Rose</string> &lt;jordan_rose at apple.com&gt;<p>February  2, 2016 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Feb 2, 2016, at 16:53, Ross O&#39;Brien via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; For example: getting the first element from an array of optionals.
