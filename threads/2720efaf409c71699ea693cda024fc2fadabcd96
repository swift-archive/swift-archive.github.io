I guess it would be a<br>&gt;&gt; mandatory transformation for COFF.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; But if it&#39;s not representable in COFF, that&#39;s pretty conclusive.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I did look into this.  It is, as I suspected, not possible to represent an<br>&gt; offset to the value in the ILT or IAT.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>This seems to be the only blocking issue for the Windows port.  There is a<br>minor build wrinkle that needs to be worked out, but everything else seems<br>to be more or less ready for enabling a Windows port.<br></p><p><br>&gt; John.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  However, it sounds like you think this needs to be *doubly* indirected,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; i.e. the conformance list needs to be a relative offset to a variable<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; containing a pointer to a variable containing a pointer to the import<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; lookup table.  I&#39;m not sure why that would be.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; John.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; --<br>&gt;&gt; Saleem Abdulrasool<br>&gt;&gt; compnerd (at) compnerd (dot) org<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; --<br>&gt; Saleem Abdulrasool<br>&gt; compnerd (at) compnerd (dot) org<br>&gt;<br></p><p><br></p><p>-- <br>Saleem Abdulrasool<br>compnerd (at) compnerd (dot) org<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160713/41e91f2f/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
