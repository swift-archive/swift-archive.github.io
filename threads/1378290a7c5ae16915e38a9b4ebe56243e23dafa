This structure has a number of advantages when parsing.  For example, it allows “modifiers” like “mutating” and “public” to be context sensitive identifiers instead of themselves being keywords.  It also helps with more subtle things like error recovery in the face of invalid code that produces parsing errors.<br></p><p>-Chris<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20160407/2a3ef391/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
