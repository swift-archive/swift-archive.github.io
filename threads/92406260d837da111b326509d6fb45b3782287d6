It wasn’t related to Objective-C interop, and I’m not aware of other changes that would affect the balance of “nil&quot; in Swift.  If anything, “nil” is destined to become *more* simple, since only Optional will be NilLiteralConverible once the planned Swift 3 changes land (&quot;abolish IOU&quot; and “make nullability explicit for unsafe pointers”).<br></p><p>-Chris<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9bfba345bd373f7b8874d58fed6372ff?s=50"></div><header><strong>Proposal: disallow nil in favor of .None</strong> from <string>David Waite</string> &lt;david at alkaline-solutions.com&gt;<p>April 10, 2016 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Paul,<br></p><p>Basically, nil is a literal and not a shortcut or alias for Optional.none.<br></p><p>Types which implement NilLiteralConvertible can have a new instance initialized by the ‘nil’ literal.
