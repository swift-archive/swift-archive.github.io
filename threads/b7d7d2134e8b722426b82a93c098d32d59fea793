And we couldn&#39;t find a “where”-based<br>&gt; name that began to clarify it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I will argue that even changing to “suchThat,” as in the PR, does not<br>&gt; sufficiently clarify the closure&#39;s polarity, and the only true fix for<br>&gt; filter is to use a different base name (some have suggested “select,”<br>&gt; and I have other ideas), but that is out of scope for this particular<br>&gt; set of changes.  So if the community is happier with a “where” label<br>&gt; here I can live with it.

(Yes, I criticized `where` as a method name in<br>&gt;&gt; another thread, but I don&#39;t think `where` is a problem when there&#39;s a<br>&gt;&gt; function base name to give it context.) When they don&#39;t work, that&#39;s<br>&gt;&gt; usually because of a less-than-ideal base name. I&#39;m not saying that<br>&gt;&gt; *all* base names that aren&#39;t compatible with `where` should be<br>&gt;&gt; changed, but rather that if `where` is not enough, that&#39;s an API<br>&gt;&gt; smell.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; * In particular, `elementWhere` is not a good label for the same<br>&gt;&gt; reason that `removeElement` is not a good name. Session 403 last week<br>&gt;&gt; actually talked about this between roughly minutes 8 and 11. (I&#39;m sure<br>&gt;&gt; you know about its content; you probably saw it before we did.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes I do, and I think you misinterpreted the message in that session.<br>&gt; There&#39;s nothing wrong with repeating type information when it&#39;s<br>&gt; necessary for clarity or fluency at the use-site.  In the case of<br>&gt; `contains(elementWhere:)`, it&#39;s there for fluency:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;        customers.contains(where: isSingle)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; doesn&#39;t read as well as:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;        customers.contains(elementWhere: isSingle)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The point is not to imagine that every argument should be preceded by<br>&gt; a noun, and repetition of type information is often the result of<br>&gt; trying to do that.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; * I like `separatedWhere` on `split`, but I think the Equatable<br>&gt;&gt; version needs a similar renaming. <br>&gt;<br>&gt; That&#39;s a nice thought; I think it&#39;s arguably out-of-scope here, though.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Perhaps `separatedBy`?  `separatedOn`? The usual opposite of `where`,<br>&gt;&gt; `of`, doesn&#39;t work here. (Alternatively, `separatedWhere` could be<br>&gt;&gt; `separatorWhere` instead, but that&#39;s not quite as elegant.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I&#39;d want to consider variations of `separatingAt` or `onSeparator` or<br>&gt; `atSeparator` too... which makes me thing “separatedWhere” might not be<br>&gt; as good as “separatingWhere” for the closure version.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; * I&#39;m very uncomfortable with the amount of weight<br>&gt;&gt; `accumulatingResultBy` adds to `reduce`. `combinedBy` seems perfectly<br>&gt;&gt; cromulent to me. I&#39;m even more concerned by your suggestion in the<br>&gt;&gt; pull request body of<br>&gt;&gt; `accumulating(startingFrom:combiningBy:)`. `reduce` is a subtle and<br>&gt;&gt; slightly confusing operation; adding more words to its call sites will<br>&gt;&gt; not solve that problem. If you want to invent a new name from whole<br>&gt;&gt; cloth, I would probably use something like `combining(with<br>&gt;&gt; initialResult: T, by nextResult: (T, Element) -&gt; T)`. (For that<br>&gt;&gt; matter, while we&#39;re working in this area, `sequence(first:next:)`<br>&gt;&gt; could use a similar coat of paint.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As with `filter(suchThat:`, `reduce(accumulatingResultBy:` is attempting<br>&gt; to solve with an argument label what IMO is a grave weakness in clarity<br>&gt; of the base name.  If you read the documentation for `reduce`, you&#39;ll<br>&gt; see that it&#39;s all about accumulating a result, and if you consider that<br>&gt; its current signature often leads to O(N^2) behavior and we are thinking<br>&gt; about adding an overload that takes its “accumulator” inout, the<br>&gt; arguments for avoiding the name “accumulate” get progressively weaker.<br>&gt; But as noted earlier, changing base names is out-of-scope for this<br>&gt; proposal.  As with “filter,” I could live with leaving this alone,<br>&gt; though I do believe “accumulatingResultBy:” is a real improvement in<br>&gt; clarity.<br></p><p>...but I think it&#39;s overly specific at the expense of smoothness.  So<br>I&#39;ve removed `Result` from that name.<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; * I agree with the comment on GitHub that `invoke` should be<br>&gt;&gt; `execute`. <br>&gt;<br>&gt; Why?  Rationales help.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; If you see a distinction between the two cases on the number of<br>&gt;&gt; arguments, I would then suggest `passTo` as the label on these<br>&gt;&gt; methods: `views.forEach(passTo: addSubview)`,<br>&gt;&gt; `withUnsafeBufferPointer(&amp;bytes, passTo: Data.init(buffer:))`.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Those are intriguing ideas, but that direction tends to suggest this<br>&gt; would be better:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   views.passEach(to: addSubview)<br>&gt;   passUnsafeBufferPointer(to: Data.init(buffer:))<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ...until you pass a trailing closure:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   views.passEach { addSubView($0) }<br>&gt;   passUnsafeBufferPointer { Data.init(buffer:$0) }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (note: withUnsafeBufferPointer takes only one argument, a closure).<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; * It&#39;s a little odd that you&#39;re using `comparingBy` for `Equatable`<br>&gt;&gt; and `orderingBy` for `Comparable`. Did you judge `equatingBy` to be<br>&gt;&gt; too awkward? <br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes, and because it&#39;s not “equating,” which would mean using equality<br>&gt; (==) it&#39;s “testing equivalence” with respect to the predicate.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Perhaps the real problem is that `Equatable` ought to be `Comparable`<br>&gt;&gt; and `Comparable` ought to be `Orderable`? <br>&gt;<br>&gt; I don&#39;t think so, personally, but regardless I consider such a change<br>&gt; out-of-scope for this proposal.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Or maybe `comparingBy` should just be something more general, like<br>&gt;&gt; `matchingBy`? That would make perfectly sensible but slightly odd use<br>&gt;&gt; cases like this one read better:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 	let isAnIdiot = luggageCombination.starts(with: [1, 2, 3, 4,<br>&gt;&gt; 5], matchingBy: &lt;=) // Matches [1,2,3,4,5], but also [1,1,1,1,1],<br>&gt;&gt; [1,2,3,2,1], etc.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That would not be legal, as &lt;= is not an equivalence relation.  You<br>&gt; could think about redefining the meaning of `starts(with:` to not<br>&gt; require an equivalence relation, but that&#39;s something I&#39;m not confident<br>&gt; *I* know how to do meaningfully, and regardless is again out-of-scope.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Very soon (hopefully), I will be posting an early draft of a proposal<br>&gt;&gt; renaming the various first/last/prefix/suffix/etc. APIs. I believe the<br>&gt;&gt; only place it touches on your proposal is in<br>&gt;&gt; `starts(with:isEquivalent:)`, but I think your changes to the second<br>&gt;&gt; parameter label can be easily incorporated into what I&#39;m doing.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Great!<br></p><p>I&#39;m going to write up the proposal ASAP based on the current PR unless I<br>get more feedback.<br></p><p>Thanks,<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/60dcb74d816e29b2aa6b9c0b5969670e?s=50"></div><header><strong>Stdlib closure argument labels and parameter names</strong> from <string>Xiaodi Wu</string> &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;<p>June 22, 2016 at 11:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>I&#39;ll duly oblige with some pushback on `suchThat`.
