The baroque set of rules for external parameter was one of the most confusing and frustrating parts of Swift 1. Swift 2 substantially improved on this situation. The proposed change will rationalize this part of the language, substantially reducing Swift&#39;s complexity.<br></p><p>   • Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Definitely.<br></p><p>   • Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. Swift 3 is about increasing power while reducing incidentally complexity. This is a strong contribution to the latter.<br></p><p>   • If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>I really appreciate that Swift follows Objective-C in using named parameters. This results in much more readable client code. That said, Objective-C&#39;s syntax necessitates combining the action part of a method&#39;s name with the first parameter label. Breaking with that is a sensible thing to do. Programmers will still retain the ability to suppress any external parameter name, including the first, so the expressive power of the language is unchanged.<br></p><p>Turning this question on its head, I&#39;ve never used a language with parameter naming rules as complex as Swift&#39;s. This proposal rectifies that problem.<br></p><p>   • How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>I read the proposal in detail twice. I&#39;ve been bothered by the complexity of the external parameter rules since Swift was introduced, so the problem has been on my mind since WWDC 2014.<br></p><p>Cheers, <br></p><p>Curt <br>------------------------- <br>Curt Clifton, PhD Software Developer <br>The Omni Group <br>www.curtclifton.net<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/05e222e6ef4d84013bb3baeb0e25c90b?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0046 Establish consistent label behavior across all parameters including first labels</strong> from <string>Patrick Gili</string> &lt;gili.patrick.r at gili-labs.com&gt;<p>March 12, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; <br>&gt; 	• What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>I like this proposal because it increases consistency.

It wouldn’t bother me that a function with a single parameter wouldn’t require a label for that parameter while an init with a single parameter would. I mention this because one of the reasons given for no label on the first parameter was that half of the functions in an audit had zero or one parameter. It is important to me that a function with multiple parameters requires labels for all of them.<br></p><p>As an aside, once we have this consistency, I would like guidance from Apple and support from Xcode on how to format these method definitions and calls if we place them on multiple lines (each parameter on a separate line). In Obj-C we lined up the colons, in Swift should we line up the colons, the first letter of the parameter label, something else? It’s not that I care what we choose, but it would be nice to have a consistent format that is supported by Xcode. Currently, if we indent in a way other than is supported by Xcode, subsequent lines are indented awkwardly.<br></p><p>Thanks,<br></p><p>Daniel<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>&gt; On Mar 11, 2016, at 1:01 PM, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The review of “Establish consistent label behavior across all parameters including first labels” begins now and runs through March 15, 2016.

The proposal is available here:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0046-first-label.md<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Reviews are an important part of the Swift evolution process. All reviews should be sent to the swift-evolution mailing list at:<br>&gt; 	https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>&gt; or, if you would like to keep your feedback private, directly to the review manager. When replying, please try to keep the proposal link at the top of the message:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What goes into a review?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review through constructive criticism and, eventually, determine the direction of Swift. When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	• What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt; 	• Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt; 	• Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt; 	• If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt; 	• How much effort did you put into your review?
