In other words, classes naturally bypass the mutation<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; model.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If we are going to maintain source stability after Swift 3, it seems<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; that we either need to address this now, or decide that it won&#39;t be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; addressed, because of the “viral const” problem.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; One idea that Jordan and I have floated is that protocols with mutating<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; methods should be constrained to applying to non-class types.  That<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; would be a step in the right direction, but, that still leaves cases<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; like gg able to easily violate expectations when the protocol in<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; question has no mutating methods.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I really *dislike* the approach of disallowing class types for<br>&gt;&gt; protocols with mutating methods, unless an additional reference type<br>&gt;&gt; is added.  I have several protocols which have conforming classes and<br>&gt;&gt; structs and that that lets you choose reference vs value semantics.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; How do you write generic code that works on both reference and value<br>&gt; types conforming to such a protocol?<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I would much rather have us mark class methods as mutating when they<br>&gt;&gt; change the class’s value, and just having the concept be separate from<br>&gt;&gt; let/var in that case.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Another possibility would be to formalize the idea of value semantics in<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; protocol declarations, so that non-class protocols were only allowed to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; apply to values.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I would like to have a way to require value semantics in a protocol<br>&gt;&gt; (similar to how we can require ‘class&#39; now).  I still really want/need<br>&gt;&gt; the ability to have a protocol which can be adhered to by both value<br>&gt;&gt; and class types though...<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I really want to see examples of generic code that isn&#39;t terribly tricky<br>&gt; to write correctly so it will work on both kinds of type.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s also possible that I&#39;ve overestimated the seriousness of the issue<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; and we actually can afford to postpone thinking about it until after<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift 4.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Thoughts?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I would vote to postpone to swift 4, and have it be part of a larger<br>&gt;&gt; discussion involving the marking of side-effects and thread safe<br>&gt;&gt; mutability.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; If you need a stop-gap for Swift 3, I would be in favor of adding the<br>&gt;&gt; ability to mark a particular protocol as needing to be a value type<br>&gt;&gt; (not every protocol… just those that are marked as such).  That should<br>&gt;&gt; give you the guarantees you need for particular projects.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That&#39;s a reasonable stopping point.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Dave<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160706/bd2a1f9c/attachment-0001.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
