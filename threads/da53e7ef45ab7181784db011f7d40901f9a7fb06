The proposal has been *accepted*:<br></p><p>This syntax has been extensively discussed by the community, and is a cornerstone of the “generalized existentials” work for future Swift releases.  The community was overall positive on the feature with a few subjective concerns about “&amp;&quot; being tightly associated with bitwise logical operations.  The core team believes this will not be contextually confusing since it appears in a type position, between two names that are obviously nominal types (e.g. they are capitalized).<br></p><p>I filed SR-1938 to track implementation of this work, this is a somewhat advanced starter project which would be a great place for someone to dive into the parsing logic in Swift.<br></p><p>Thank you to Adrian Zubarev and Austin Zheng for driving this forward!<br></p><p>-Chris Lattner<br>Review Manager<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
