As you say “But the main thing in FP is the use of higher-order functions, which Swift enthusiastically supports, but have nothing whatever to do with protocol-oriented programming”.  Swift isn’t just a Protocol-Oriented programming language or an Object-Oriented language or a functional programming language it is actually all of them and more.  While other languages attempt to support different paradigms, in my opinion, Swift is one of the few language that actually does a good job at supporting multiple paradigms. <br></p><p>In the conclusion section of my post, I mention that while I pointed out a lot of ways that I believe POP is superior to OOP I would not say that POP is a clear winner over OOP.  The winner is actually the programmer because we are not limited to one programming paradigm.  We can choose the paradigm that fits our needs.  Personally I have use POP in a number of projects and I definitely prefer it to OOP or FP but I would not criticize anyone that uses the other two because they are very valid paradigms that have proven over time.  <br></p><p><br>Jon<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; zhaoxin<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Mon, Feb 15, 2016 at 7:59 AM, Jon Hoffman via swift-users &lt;<br>&gt;&gt; swift-users at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Numerous tutorials that I have seen take a very Object-Oriented approach<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; to the protocol-oriented programming (POP) paradigm.
