I&#39;m a Swift enthusiast too!<br></p><p>I blog about Swift and JavaScript languages at https://rainsoft.io.<br></p><p>When I publish articles about Swift, one drawback (compared to<br>JavaScript situation) is the limited number of places where I can<br>share new articles. Such situation negatively affects the propagation<br>of new content about Swift.<br></p><p>In case of JavaScript, I have a big number of sites where to share. I<br>can submit to http://www.echojs.com/, https://jslive.com/,<br>http://javascriptkicks.com/ and https://www.javascript.com/news.<br>These sites bring a lot of benefits for bloggers (easier to gain<br>traffic), readers (much easier to discover valuable content) and as<br>result the popularity of JavaScript language itself.<br>echojs.com actually generates traffic to my blog comparable to twitter.com.<br></p><p>Swift should implement the same efficient strategy.<br>In my view, an aggregator (for Swift content only) brings the<br>following benefits:<br>- Easier for developers to find quality information about the language:<br>   * Newest articles, tutorials, books publishing, etc;<br>   * Language evolution announcements: new versions, hot proposals, etc;<br>   * Swift community news: conferences, meetups;<br>   * Promote the high-rated posts to top, by implement a voting system<br>(the way http://echojs.com does)<br>- Easier for bloggers to share their content and reach wider audience;<br>as result it stimulates to write more content about Swift;<br>Beneficial side effects:<br>- The backend side application must be written in Swift using Kitura,<br>Perfect or alternative;<br>- The application should be open sourced;<br>- Put efforts on code quality and performance. This should serve a<br>demonstration how comfortable Swift is for backend development.<br></p><p>The motto: &quot;On Swift, about Swift, for Swift developers!&quot;<br></p><p>Let&#39;s start the brainstorming:<br>- What do you think about the benefits of such a project?<br>- Why such an aggregator is better (or worse) than existing<br>alternatives like https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/?<br>- Maybe such a project is already in development. Do you know some?<br>- Swift needs you! Do you wish to participate?<br></p><p>Thank you, Dmitri.<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
