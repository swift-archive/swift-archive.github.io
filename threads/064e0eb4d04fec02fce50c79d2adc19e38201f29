When `self` is not mandatory, then adding self should have no impact whatsoever.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Why should one add a self that is not mandatory?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1. for symmetry (1):<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	self.foo = other.foo<br>&gt; 	let delta = self.x - other.x<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2. for symmetry (2):<br>&gt; 	<br>&gt; 	init(a:String, index:Int) {<br>&gt; 		self.name = name<br>&gt; 		self.position = index+1	// keep 1-based value for implementation reasons<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 3. add your own reasons to use an explicit self even when not required, and I’m sure you did.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; So generally speaking, using self when not mandatory should have no impact on the program at all.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; REASON 2. What happens when a property starts its life as `let`, but turns `var` eventually? For example, the property eventually becomes lazy. OK now it’s is illegal to use the property without explicit `self` in closures, and you break a bunch of code. And you need to bump the major version of your package.

That’s often the desired behavior. On a casual thinking through, though, it seems like a can of worms — and the “guard let self = self else { return }” proposal on another thread gives most of the same benefit.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; P<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151208/064e1f29/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a06dd7924588141b9c907543798c2524?s=50"></div><header><strong>Proposal: Closures capture weak by default</strong> from <string>Gwendal Roué</string> &lt;gwendal.roue at gmail.com&gt;<p>December  8, 2015 at 07:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt;&gt; I’m really not found at all of having `let` properties captured by closures when used without explicit `self`.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Three reasons […]<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; REASON 2.

My point is that the current state of the language makes it crystal clear about the captured objects, when your proposal makes it 1. unclear, and 2. breaks the fact that the non-mandatory `self` should remain *discretionary*.<br></p><p>I’ve given symmetry examples above. Here is one another:<br></p><p>	let foo = self.foo	// discretionary foo<br>	self.foo = nil<br>	// Now self.foo is nil and can expose its new clean state to other objects, for example an eventual delegate.<br>	// Yet foo is still usable, for whatever purpose.<br></p><p>Without the discretionary self, we’d have to use ugly variable names like `theFoo`, `aFoo`, `myFoo`, or whatever funny names that are nor required today:<br></p><p>	let theFoo = foo<br>	foo = nil<br></p><p>To sum up: non-mandatory `self.` should remain discretionary. Hence any idea that is based on the absence or presence of an explicit `self.` is a bad idea.<br></p><p>Gwendal Roué<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/06c1dcc7dce6a93d194b9c013376e3f0?s=50"></div><header><strong>Proposal: Closures capture weak by default</strong> from <string>Joe Groff</string> &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt;<p>December  8, 2015 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Dec 8, 2015, at 10:48 AM, Gwendal Roué &lt;gwendal.roue at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I’m really not found at all of having `let` properties captured by closures when used without explicit `self`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Three reasons […]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; REASON 2.
