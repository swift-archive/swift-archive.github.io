The proposal has been accepted.<br></p><p>We didn&#39;t get a lot of commentary on this proposal (though we did get some positive private feedback), but there appears to be general support for this proposal. Some details of the proposal were revised in response to feedback. The revisions can be viewed at https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/173.<br></p><p>The accepted review can be found at https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0038-swiftpm-c-language-targets.md.<br></p><p>While we now have a specification for how this feature should work, we do not yet have a schedule for when we will be able to implement it. If you are interested in contributing an implementation for this proposal, please coordinate with us on the swift-build-dev at swift.org mailing list.<br></p><p>Thank you all for your comments.<br></p><p>	- Rick<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
