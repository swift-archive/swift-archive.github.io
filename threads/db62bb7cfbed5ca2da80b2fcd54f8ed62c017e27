I definitely don&#39;t want the compiler doing this without an explicit request of some kind.  Existentials should at least be safe by default.  If we *really* need a way to introduce unsafe existentials it should be opt-in (I have no idea what that might look like).  But I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth introducing a feature like that just to make it easier to create types with an unsafe interface.<br></p><p>But why would you want the unsafe behavior of AnyCollection when we could have a safe &#39;typealias AnyCollection&lt;T&gt; = Collection where .Element == T&#39;?  You would be able to safely use indexes received from the collection to index back into it.  Usage that would cause a runtime crash can be caught at compile time.  The only thing you wouldn&#39;t be able to do is take an index received from one collection and use with another.  Is there a specific use case the current design supports that the safer existential would not?<br></p><p>-Matthew<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Dave<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
