Swift is such a...simple language compared to everything else. That being said, as a result of the specs, it is also much more verbose in terms of writing the code. Compared to other languages, it is written out instead of shoved onto a few lines. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Is there a way to import modules into other modules? Because it looks like a weekend project that will eventually get posted by myself at http://github.com/Christoffen-Corporation. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Sent from Outlook Mobile<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I’d recommend having a look at the Swift package manager example again — https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/SystemModules.md<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; There’s an example of using those modules together.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Fri, Dec 11, 2015 at 1:52 PM -0800, &quot;Gage Morgan via swift-users&quot; &lt;swift-users at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I meant the code posted in the Gist link above.

Swift is such a...simple language compared to everything else. That being said, as a result of the specs, it is also much more verbose in terms of writing the code. Compared to other languages, it is written out instead of shoved onto a few lines. <br>Is there a way to import modules into other modules?
