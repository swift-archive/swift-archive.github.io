The proposal has been *deferred* for re-evaluation later in Swift 3.<br></p><p>The core team and much of the community would like to get the predictability wins of this proposal.  However, recent experience with the fallout of &quot;SE-0072: Fully eliminate implicit bridging conversions from Swift” has raised some concerns that it may have overly harmed Objective-C APIs designed around the “id” type.  Joe Groff will be investigating a few ideas that may help make SE-0072 work better in practice, and until they are explored and understood, the core team prefers to defer discussion on SE-0083.<br></p><p>Once we have clarity on the fate of SE-0072 (in the next 3-6 weeks), we can discuss SE-0083 again.  Thank you to Joe Groff for this proposal, and also for helping to sort out the issues related to SE-0072.<br></p><p>-Chris<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
