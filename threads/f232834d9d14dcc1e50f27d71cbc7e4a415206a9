Further, our intention is for Swift and its community to make as big an impact as possible, so feel free to use or adapt the process as you see fit.  Several other communities appear to be learning from swift-evolution, and I think that’s great!<br></p><p>-Chris<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/238f17efb7582cc40d308dbf239f462b?s=50"></div><header><strong>Adopting the swift evolution process in a different OSS community</strong> from <string>Heiko Braun</string> &lt;ike.braun at googlemail.com&gt;<p>September  2, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Thanks for the feedback Chris. <br></p><p>I am going to suggest this process to our community and will provide a reference to this list, if it will be accepted.
