I am quite happy with most of Swift.<br>And for most things I read on this forum I have very little to contribute<br>right now, simply because most things imho are striding :o) in the <br>right direction!  I am quite a colorful person, even literally, just take<br>a look at my app site ravelnotes.com or my profile on LinkedIn.<br>Contacts welcome.<br></p><p>Discussing on a forum, is just writing. If one write things down,<br>it all looks very definitive and sometimes it looks even harsh, <br>or aggressive. It all becomes too serious, looses fine nuances<br>and appears with undesired increased polarity. conflict-prone.<br>With this form of communication, there is no interaction, <br>no non-verbal communication, facial expressions etc.<br></p><p>I would rather sit together with all of you, with fresh coffee around<br>a large round :o)  table! Or even walk around for a week or so<br>at Apple to experience the spirit, the drive and give some<br>feedback. Not that I am that important. <br></p><p>I embrace you all, <br>Kind Regards,<br>Ted<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
