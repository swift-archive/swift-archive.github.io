Nevertheless, it is useful and fits the overload set in general, if you view Optional as a sequence of zero or one T. It resembles this overload, where the closure returns an arbitrary sequence:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; extension SequenceType {<br>&gt;   public func flatMap&lt;S : SequenceType&gt;(transform: (Generator.Element) -&gt; S) -&gt; [S.Generator.Element]<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The type checker ensures that there is no ambiguity between the two overloads, and we don&#39;t see a reason to give one of the overloads a different name (and force users to learn it, and differentiate between the two), since conceptually the operation is the same.<br></p><p>If Swift wishes to regard Optionals as collections with 1 or 0 elements, then I propose that it should reflect that thinking with additions to the standard library.<br></p><p>Possible changes include:<br></p><p>1) Remove or rename Optional?s flatMap.  <br>This would cause a bit of breaking behavior, but it?s nothing some fixits couldn?t help with.<br></p><p>2) Add a SequenceType instance for Optional.<br>This kills 2 birds with 1 stone in that, if the radar rejection is to ring true, Optional should have a SequenceType instance in the STL, and such an instance would automatically come with its own proper overloading flatMap necessitating change 1.<br></p><p> Over in TypeLift land we?ve already implemented what we believe the SequenceType extensions should look like (https://github.com/typelift/Swiftz/blob/master/Swiftz/OptionalExt.swift#L139-L145 &lt;https://github.com/typelift/Swiftz/blob/master/Swiftz/OptionalExt.swift#L139-L145&gt;).<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151203/29620825/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
