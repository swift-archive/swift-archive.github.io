Got it working on OSX with 2016-05-09 (a) toolchain without problems, using the CSV parser from https://github.com/Daniel1of1/CSwiftV with the minimal modifications to compile with swift 3.<br></p><p>But i need it to compile and work with linux ubuntu.<br>I prepared a work environment with the instructions in https://www.raywenderlich.com/122189/introduction-to-open-source-swift-on-linux<br>and it works and compiles swift code wonderfully, even installed the same snapshot of the swift toolchain to make it all happy.<br></p><p>The problem i found is some of the string functionality i need for the csv parser to work, is not working ok in linux.<br>- String.replacingOccurences(of: stringToFind, with: stringToPutInstead)<br>does not work the same in both environments.<br></p><p>i have a csv file obtainable from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients<br>That contains the pattern “\r\n” and i need it to be replaced with “\n” to later on process the rest of the file.<br></p><p>the code i use is:<br></p><p>        #if os(Linux)<br>            print(&quot;Let&#39;s change those carriage returns...&quot;)<br>            processedString = string.replacingOccurrences(of: &quot;\r\n&quot;, with: &quot;\n&quot;)<br>        #else<br>            processedString = string.replacingOccurrences(of: &quot;\r\n&quot;, with: &quot;\n&quot;)<br>        #endif<br>And it compiles flawlessly in linux, but when it’s time to execute, it throws an error message like:<br>Let&#39;s change those carriage returns...<br>Illegal instruction (core dumped)<br>I tried escaping the pattern ( “\\r\\n”) and it does not throw the error, but neither replaces the code<br>When i tried executing the same code in the Linux virtual machine in the REPL environment, the sequence of events was:<br></p><p> 1&gt; import Foundation<br>  2&gt; let path = &quot;/vagrant/credit_card.csv&quot; <br>path: String = &quot;/vagrant/credit_card.csv&quot;<br>  3&gt; let text = NSString(contentsOfFile: path as String, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding) <br>text: Foundation.NSString = {<br>  Foundation.NSObject = {}<br>  _cfinfo = {<br>    info = 1920<br>    pad = 0<br>  }<br>  _storage = &quot;ID,LIMIT_BAL,SEX,EDUCATION,MARRIAGE,AGE,PAY_0,PAY_2,PAY_3,PAY_4,PAY_5,PAY_6,BILL_AMT1,BILL_AMT2,BILL_AMT3,BILL_AMT4,BILL_AMT5,BILL_AMT6,PAY_AMT1,PAY_AMT2,PAY_AMT3,PAY_AMT4,PAY_AMT5,PAY_AMT6,default payment next month\r\n1,20000,2,2,1,24,2,2,-1,-1,-2,-2,3913,3102,689,0,0,0,0,689,0,0,0,0,1\r\n2,120000,2,2,2,26,-1,2,0,0,0,2,2682,1725,2682,3272,3455,3261,0,1000,1000,1000,0,2000,1\r\n3,90000,2,2,2,34,0,0,0,0,0,0,29239,14027,13559,14331,14948,15549,1518,1500,1000,1000,1000,5000,0\r\n4,50000,2,2,1,37,0,0,0,0,0,0,46990,48233,49291,28314,28959,29547,2000,2019,1200,1100,1069,1000,0\r\n5,50000,1,2,1,57,-1,0,-1,0,0,0,8617,5670,35835,20940,19146,19131,2000,36681,10000,9000,689,679,0\r\n6,50000,1,1,2,37,0,0,0,0,0,0,64400,57069,57608,19394,19619,20024,2500,1815,657,1000,1000,800,0\r\n7,500000,1,1,2,29,0,0,0,0,0,0,367965,412023,445007,542653,483003,473944,55000,40000,38000,20239,13750,13770,0\r\n8,100000,2,2,2,23,0,-1,-1,0,0,-1,11876,380,601,221,-159,567,380,601,0,581,1687,1542,0\r\n9,140000,2,3,1,28,0,0,2,0,0,0,11285,14096,12108,12211,11793,&quot;...<br>}<br>  4&gt; var tmp = text.replacingOccurrences(of: &quot;\r\n&quot;, with: &quot;\n&quot;)<br>tmp: String = {<br>  _core = {<br>    _baseAddress = &lt;extracting data from value failed&gt;<br></p><p>    _countAndFlags = &lt;extracting data from value failed&gt;<br></p><p>    _owner = &lt;extracting data from value failed&gt;<br></p><p>  }<br>}<br>Execution interrupted.
