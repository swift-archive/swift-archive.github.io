What should be done in that case?<br></p><p>We want Swift to be adopted widely by a diverse audience. We don&#39;t want developers to reject it because they don&#39;t like it.<br></p><p>I see two possible solutions to that kind of design problem:<br></p><p>1. Add the feature anyway and educate developers, hoping to convince them that it&#39;s the right thing to do or at least accept that it is a necessary evil. Swift&#39;s String class does this. There are traditional string operations that are deliberately hard with Swift.String because they are not compatible with Unicode strings.<br></p><p>2. Change the feature so it is more palatable to developers who dislike it. Swift&#39;s nullability does this. We believe non-nullability should be used only when necessary. But Swift also has syntax additions like optional chaining and the `nil` identifier itself along with semantic additions like implicitly-unwrapped optional to make it fairly reasonable to use nullable references if you have to or want to do so. <br></p><p><br>-- <br>Greg Parker     gparker at apple.com     Runtime Wrangler<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
