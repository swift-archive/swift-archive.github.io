It manages to describe the distinction between `union`/<br>&gt;     `unionInPlace` and `sort`/`sortInPlace` in the name itself. To me, the `ed`/<br>&gt;     `ing` difference is much more subtle and favors people who are familiar with<br>&gt;     English grammar. One can argue that `sort` is both imperative and<br>&gt;     functional, and that because of [either side] the default should be<br>&gt;     [mutable/immutable]. Both arguments are valid. <br>&gt;<br>&gt;     - David<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         On 15 Apr 2016, at 18:31, Erica Sadun via swift-evolution<br>&gt;         &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             On Apr 15, 2016, at 10:17 AM, Антон Жилин via swift-evolution<br>&gt;             &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             I&#39;ve already expressed these concerns, but nobody noticed,<br>&gt;             apparently. Here is it:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             I think current -ed/-ing convention is ugly. It breaks syntactic<br>&gt;             correctness, experience from other languages, mathematical notation<br>&gt;             and functional idioms.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             `InPlace` suffix was so far more correct in these terms. We can make<br>&gt;             anything a convention, but should we?<br>&gt;             I liked the proposal about new naming conventions, but overlooked<br>&gt;             this change.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             Many people will agree with me. This still can be reviewed until<br>&gt;             Swift 3.<br>&gt;             If so, I will create a proposal to correct &quot;the big three&quot; in this.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             What do you think?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         I would like to see a formal proposal along these lines.
