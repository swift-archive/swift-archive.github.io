Some of these proposals have implementations actively underway. For those proposals already in active development — and near completion — I am okay with extending the deadline for those changes to Friday, July 29. Such changes need to be approved by the release manager (myself) and should be merged into master via a pull request. When creating the pull request, please assign it to me (tkremenek), and mention the pull request on the swift-dev mailing list as well with the SE number in the email title.<br></p><p>The rest of the unimplemented proposals do not make Swift 3. This leaves us with the question of what to do with them. These proposals represent the known and reviewed changes we want to make to Swift, but inevitably there will also be changes that we don&#39;t even know about today that we will want to take into Swift that can impact core source stability. That said, we also have a very strong desire to maintain source compatibility with Swift 3 and Swift 4 as much as possible to provide some stability for which Swift users to build upon. The challenge of course is reconciling these diametrically opposing goals: maintaining source stability while having the ability to incorporate more core (and important) language changes that are possibly source-breaking.<br></p><p>The Swift team at Apple has reflected on this and decided what it &quot;means&quot; for Swift 3 to be source compatible with Swift 4 and later releases going forward. Our goal is to allow app developers to combine a mix of Swift modules (e.g., SwiftPM packages), where each module is known to compile with a specific version of the language (module A works with Swift 3, module B works with Swift 3.1, etc.), then combine those modules into a single binary. The key feature is that a module can be migrated from Swift 3 to 3.1 to 4 (and beyond) independently of its dependencies.<br></p><p>While the exact details of how we will accomplish this feat are still being discussed, here is a sketch of how this will likely work in the Swift 4 timeframe. The key enabler is a new compiler flag that indicates the language version to compile for (e.g., similar to the clang -std=c99 flag). The compiler flag will be provided by the build system you are using (e.g., Xcode, SwiftPM, etc.) on a per-module basis:<br></p><p>For language syntax/semantics, the compiler can use the language mode to properly implement the language version being used by a module.<br></p><p>For the Standard Library, additive and subtractive changes are easily handled (the former by just adding them, the later by using deprecation techniques). For semantics changes, things are much more complicated, and will need further study.<br></p><p>The great thing about this approach is that a single Swift 4 compiler is building all of the sources in an application. This allows us to roll out this approach before achieving full ABI stability — something that will be a goal for Swift 4, but is impractical to achieve for a Swift 3.x release. It also provides us a general framework in the future for handling source compatibility as Swift evolves.<br></p><p>To make this more concrete, suppose an application is written to use Swift 4, but uses packages via SwiftPM that are written using Swift 3. A single compiler would build both the app and the packages — thus ensuring that all the compiled sources are binary compatible. It would not be the case that a framework built with the Swift 3 compiler could be used by an app built using the Swift 4 compiler. That kind of library binary stability (ABI) will be a key goal of the Swift 4 release.<br></p><p>These constraints mentioned above will serve as scaffolding for Swift 4 development. Discussion about Swift 4 commences on Monday. Ahead of that, Chris Lattner plans to send out thoughts from the Core team on some of the known key goals (and non-goals) for the release. In the meantime, the focus over the next couple days should be taking stock of what has landed for Swift 3 and to see if any of the proposals mentioned above are close to being completed or are truly out of scope.<br></p><p>Thank you again to everyone for making Swift 3 such as fantastic release!<br></p><p>Ted<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/attachments/20160727/fa9b0ccf/attachment-0001.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/569ed436467cf145f3bbdd0d53fbe115?s=50"></div><header><strong>End of source-breaking changes for Swift 3</strong> from <string>Slava Pestov</string> &lt;spestov at apple.com&gt;<p>July 27, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jul 27, 2016, at 12:38 PM, Ted Kremenek via swift-dev &lt;swift-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; SE-0092 - Typealiases in protocols and protocol extensions &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0092-typealiases-in-protocols.md&gt;<br>&gt; SE-0102 - Remove @noreturn attribute and introduce an empty Never type &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0102-noreturn-bottom-type.md&gt;<br>These two are implemented.

Some of these proposals have implementations actively<br>&gt; underway. For those proposals already in active development — *and near<br>&gt; completion* — I am okay with extending the deadline for those changes to *Friday,<br>&gt; July 29*. Such changes need to be approved by the release manager<br>&gt; (myself) and should be merged into master via a pull request. When<br>&gt; creating the pull request, please assign it to me (tkremenek), and<br>&gt; mention the pull request on the swift-dev mailing list as well with the<br>&gt; SE number in the email title.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The rest of the unimplemented proposals do not make Swift 3. This leaves<br>&gt; us with the question of what to do with them. These proposals represent the<br>&gt; known and reviewed changes we want to make to Swift, but inevitably there<br>&gt; will *also* be changes that we don&#39;t even know about today that we will<br>&gt; want to take into Swift that can impact core source stability. That said,<br>&gt; we also have a very strong desire to maintain source compatibility with<br>&gt; Swift 3 and Swift 4 as much as possible to provide some stability for which<br>&gt; Swift users to build upon. The challenge of course is reconciling these<br>&gt; diametrically opposing goals: maintaining source stability while having the<br>&gt; ability to incorporate more core (and important) language changes that are<br>&gt; possibly source-breaking.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The Swift team at Apple has reflected on this and decided what it &quot;means&quot;<br>&gt; for Swift 3 to be source compatible with Swift 4 and later releases going<br>&gt; forward. Our goal is to allow app developers to combine a mix of Swift<br>&gt; modules (e.g., SwiftPM packages), where each module is known to compile<br>&gt; with a specific version of the language (module A works with Swift 3,<br>&gt; module B works with Swift 3.1, etc.), then combine those modules into a<br>&gt; single binary. The key feature is that a module can be migrated from Swift<br>&gt; 3 to 3.1 to 4 (and beyond) independently of its dependencies.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; While the exact details of how we will accomplish this feat are still<br>&gt; being discussed, here is a sketch of how this will likely work in the Swift<br>&gt; 4 timeframe. The key enabler is a new compiler flag that indicates the<br>&gt; language version to compile for (e.g., similar to the clang -std=c99 flag).<br>&gt; The compiler flag will be provided by the build system you are using (e.g.,<br>&gt; Xcode, SwiftPM, etc.) on a per-module basis:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    -<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    For language syntax/semantics, the compiler can use the language mode<br>&gt;    to properly implement the language version being used by a module.<br>&gt;    -<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    For the Standard Library, additive and subtractive changes are easily<br>&gt;    handled (the former by just adding them, the later by using deprecation<br>&gt;    techniques). For semantics changes, things are much more complicated, and<br>&gt;    will need further study.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The great thing about this approach is that a single Swift 4 compiler is<br>&gt; building all of the sources in an application.

Some of these proposals have implementations actively underway. For those proposals already in active development — and near completion — I am okay with extending the deadline for those changes to Friday, July 29. Such changes need to be approved by the release manager (myself) and should be merged into master via a pull request. When creating the pull request, please assign it to me (tkremenek), and mention the pull request on the swift-dev mailing list as well with the SE number in the email title.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The rest of the unimplemented proposals do not make Swift 3. This leaves us with the question of what to do with them. These proposals represent the known and reviewed changes we want to make to Swift, but inevitably there will also be changes that we don&#39;t even know about today that we will want to take into Swift that can impact core source stability. That said, we also have a very strong desire to maintain source compatibility with Swift 3 and Swift 4 as much as possible to provide some stability for which Swift users to build upon. The challenge of course is reconciling these diametrically opposing goals: maintaining source stability while having the ability to incorporate more core (and important) language changes that are possibly source-breaking.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The Swift team at Apple has reflected on this and decided what it &quot;means&quot; for Swift 3 to be source compatible with Swift 4 and later releases going forward. Our goal is to allow app developers to combine a mix of Swift modules (e.g., SwiftPM packages), where each module is known to compile with a specific version of the language (module A works with Swift 3, module B works with Swift 3.1, etc.), then combine those modules into a single binary. The key feature is that a module can be migrated from Swift 3 to 3.1 to 4 (and beyond) independently of its dependencies.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; While the exact details of how we will accomplish this feat are still being discussed, here is a sketch of how this will likely work in the Swift 4 timeframe. The key enabler is a new compiler flag that indicates the language version to compile for (e.g., similar to the clang -std=c99 flag). The compiler flag will be provided by the build system you are using (e.g., Xcode, SwiftPM, etc.) on a per-module basis:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; For language syntax/semantics, the compiler can use the language mode to properly implement the language version being used by a module.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; For the Standard Library, additive and subtractive changes are easily handled (the former by just adding them, the later by using deprecation techniques). For semantics changes, things are much more complicated, and will need further study.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The great thing about this approach is that a single Swift 4 compiler is building all of the sources in an application. This allows us to roll out this approach before achieving full ABI stability — something that will be a goal for Swift 4, but is impractical to achieve for a Swift 3.x release. It also provides us a general framework in the future for handling source compatibility as Swift evolves.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; To make this more concrete, suppose an application is written to use Swift 4, but uses packages via SwiftPM that are written using Swift 3.

&gt;&gt; not make today&#39;s cutoff. Some of these proposals have<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; implementations actively underway. For those proposals already in<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; active development — and near completion — I am okay with extending<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; the deadline for those changes to Friday, July 29. Such changes need<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; to be approved by the release manager (myself) and should be merged<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; into master via a pull request. When creating the pull request,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; please assign it to me (tkremenek), and mention the pull request on<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; the swift-dev mailing list as well with the SE number in the email<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; title.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; The rest of the unimplemented proposals do not make Swift 3. This<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; leaves us with the question of what to do with them. These proposals<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; represent the known and reviewed changes we want to make to Swift,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; but inevitably there will also be changes that we don&#39;t even know<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; about today that we will want to take into Swift that can impact<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; core source stability. That said, we also have a very strong desire<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; to maintain source compatibility with Swift 3 and Swift 4 as much as<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; possible to provide some stability for which Swift users to build<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; upon. The challenge of course is reconciling these diametrically<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; opposing goals: maintaining source stability while having the<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; ability to incorporate more core (and important) language changes<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; that are possibly source-breaking.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; The Swift team at Apple has reflected on this and decided what it<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;means&quot; for Swift 3 to be source compatible with Swift 4 and later<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; releases going forward. Our goal is to allow app developers to<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; combine a mix of Swift modules (e.g., SwiftPM packages), where each<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; module is known to compile with a specific version of the language<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; (module A works with Swift 3, module B works with Swift 3.1, etc.),<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; then combine those modules into a single binary. The key feature is<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; that a module can be migrated from Swift 3 to 3.1 to 4 (and beyond)<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; independently of its dependencies.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; While the exact details of how we will accomplish this feat are<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; still being discussed, here is a sketch of how this will likely work<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; in the Swift 4 timeframe. The key enabler is a new compiler flag<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; that indicates the language version to compile for (e.g., similar to<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; the clang -std=c99 flag). The compiler flag will be provided by the<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; build system you are using (e.g., Xcode, SwiftPM, etc.) on a<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; per-module basis:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; For language syntax/semantics, the compiler can use the language<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; mode to properly implement the language version being used by a<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; module.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; For the Standard Library, additive and subtractive changes are<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; easily handled (the former by just adding them, the later by using<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; deprecation techniques). For semantics changes, things are much more<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; complicated, and will need further study.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; The great thing about this approach is that a single Swift 4<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; compiler is building all of the sources in an application. This<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; allows us to roll out this approach before achieving full ABI<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; stability — something that will be a goal for Swift 4, but is<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; impractical to achieve for a Swift 3.x release. It also provides us<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; a general framework in the future for handling source compatibility<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; as Swift evolves.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; To make this more concrete, suppose an application is written to use<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Swift 4, but uses packages via SwiftPM that are written using Swift<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. A single compiler would build both the app and the packages —<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; thus ensuring that all the compiled sources are binary<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; compatible. It would not be the case that a framework built with the<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Swift 3 compiler could be used by an app built using the Swift 4<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; compiler. That kind of library binary stability (ABI) will be a key<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; goal of the Swift 4 release.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; These constraints mentioned above will serve as scaffolding for<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Swift 4 development. Discussion about Swift 4 commences on<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Monday. Ahead of that, Chris Lattner plans to send out thoughts from<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; the Core team on some of the known key goals (and non-goals) for the<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; release. In the meantime, the focus over the next couple days should<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; be taking stock of what has landed for Swift 3 and to see if any of<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; the proposals mentioned above are close to being completed or are<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; truly out of scope.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Thank you again to everyone for making Swift 3 such as fantastic<br>&gt; release!<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Ted<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; --<br>&gt; -Dave<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160727/c3756007/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8aa3a9da9a32d3e98805b4a5409e4cee?s=50"></div><header><strong>End of source-breaking changes for Swift 3</strong> from <string>Anton Zhilin</string> &lt;antonyzhilin at gmail.com&gt;<p>July 28, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/c8c41b385c0312e562abe4952fa2d6794dec2e0f<br>Is SE-0077 going to be implemented for Swift 3?<br></p><p>https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/internal/SwiftExperimental/SwiftExperimental.swift<br>Does this code actually run?<br></p><p>If so, I will add &quot;implemented&quot; to the proposal, plus I still haven&#39;t added<br>latest naming changes. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br></p><p>2016-07-28 1:17 GMT+03:00 Tony Allevato via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;:<br></p><p>&gt; I noticed that while SE-0091 appears to be implemented (from a cursory<br>&gt; glance at some of the affected types like Equatable and String), it looks<br>&gt; like the named methods are still part of the FloatingPoint protocol and<br>&gt; they still use global operators.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Is anyone tracking the migration of that protocol (and possibly also the<br>&gt; new Integer protocols) to use the new operator technique?

make today&#39;s cutoff. Some of these proposals have implementations actively<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; underway. For those proposals already in active development — *and near<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; completion* — I am okay with extending the deadline for those changes<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; to *Friday, July 29*. Such changes need to be approved by the release<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; manager (myself) and should be merged into master via a pull request.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; When creating the pull request, please assign it to me (tkremenek), and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; mention the pull request on the swift-dev mailing list as well with the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; SE number in the email title.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The rest of the unimplemented proposals do not make Swift 3. This leaves<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; us with the question of what to do with them. These proposals represent the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; known and reviewed changes we want to make to Swift, but inevitably there<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; will *also* be changes that we don&#39;t even know about today that we will<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; want to take into Swift that can impact core source stability. That said,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; we also have a very strong desire to maintain source compatibility with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift 3 and Swift 4 as much as possible to provide some stability for which<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift users to build upon. The challenge of course is reconciling these<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; diametrically opposing goals: maintaining source stability while having the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ability to incorporate more core (and important) language changes that are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; possibly source-breaking.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The Swift team at Apple has reflected on this and decided what it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;means&quot; for Swift 3 to be source compatible with Swift 4 and later releases<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; going forward. Our goal is to allow app developers to combine a mix of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift modules (e.g., SwiftPM packages), where each module is known to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; compile with a specific version of the language (module A works with Swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 3, module B works with Swift 3.1, etc.), then combine those modules into a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; single binary. The key feature is that a module can be migrated from Swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 to 3.1 to 4 (and beyond) independently of its dependencies.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; While the exact details of how we will accomplish this feat are still<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; being discussed, here is a sketch of how this will likely work in the Swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 timeframe. The key enabler is a new compiler flag that indicates the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; language version to compile for (e.g., similar to the clang -std=c99 flag).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The compiler flag will be provided by the build system you are using (e.g.,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Xcode, SwiftPM, etc.) on a per-module basis:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    -<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    For language syntax/semantics, the compiler can use the language<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    mode to properly implement the language version being used by a module.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    -<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    For the Standard Library, additive and subtractive changes are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    easily handled (the former by just adding them, the later by using<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    deprecation techniques). For semantics changes, things are much more<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    complicated, and will need further study.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The great thing about this approach is that a single Swift 4 compiler is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; building all of the sources in an application. This allows us to roll out<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; this approach before achieving full ABI stability — something that will be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; a goal for Swift 4, but is impractical to achieve for a Swift 3.x release.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It also provides us a general framework in the future for handling source<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; compatibility as Swift evolves.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; To make this more concrete, suppose an application is written to use<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift 4, but uses packages via SwiftPM that are written using Swift 3. A<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; single compiler would build both the app and the packages — thus ensuring<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; that all the compiled sources are binary compatible. It would not be the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; case that a framework built with the Swift 3 compiler could be used by an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; app built using the Swift 4 compiler. That kind of library binary stability<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (ABI) will be a key goal of the Swift 4 release.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; These constraints mentioned above will serve as scaffolding for Swift 4<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; development. Discussion about Swift 4 commences on Monday. Ahead of that,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Chris Lattner plans to send out thoughts from the Core team on some of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; known key goals (and non-goals) for the release.

make today&#39;s cutoff. Some of these proposals have implementations actively<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; underway. For those proposals already in active development — *and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; near completion* — I am okay with extending the deadline for those<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; changes to *Friday, July 29*. Such changes need to be approved by the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; release manager (myself) and should be merged into master via a pull<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; request. When creating the pull request, please assign it to me (<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tkremenek), and mention the pull request on the swift-dev mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as well with the SE number in the email title.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The rest of the unimplemented proposals do not make Swift 3. This<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leaves us with the question of what to do with them. These proposals<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; represent the known and reviewed changes we want to make to Swift, but<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inevitably there will *also* be changes that we don&#39;t even know about<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; today that we will want to take into Swift that can impact core source<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stability. That said, we also have a very strong desire to maintain source<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compatibility with Swift 3 and Swift 4 as much as possible to provide some<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stability for which Swift users to build upon. The challenge of course is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reconciling these diametrically opposing goals: maintaining source<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stability while having the ability to incorporate more core (and important)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; language changes that are possibly source-breaking.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Swift team at Apple has reflected on this and decided what it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;means&quot; for Swift 3 to be source compatible with Swift 4 and later releases<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going forward. Our goal is to allow app developers to combine a mix of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift modules (e.g., SwiftPM packages), where each module is known to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compile with a specific version of the language (module A works with Swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3, module B works with Swift 3.1, etc.), then combine those modules into a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; single binary. The key feature is that a module can be migrated from Swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 to 3.1 to 4 (and beyond) independently of its dependencies.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While the exact details of how we will accomplish this feat are still<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being discussed, here is a sketch of how this will likely work in the Swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 timeframe. The key enabler is a new compiler flag that indicates the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; language version to compile for (e.g., similar to the clang -std=c99 flag).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The compiler flag will be provided by the build system you are using (e.g.,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Xcode, SwiftPM, etc.) on a per-module basis:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    -<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    For language syntax/semantics, the compiler can use the language<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    mode to properly implement the language version being used by a module.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    -<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    For the Standard Library, additive and subtractive changes are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    easily handled (the former by just adding them, the later by using<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    deprecation techniques). For semantics changes, things are much more<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    complicated, and will need further study.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The great thing about this approach is that a single Swift 4 compiler<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is building all of the sources in an application. This allows us to roll<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out this approach before achieving full ABI stability — something that will<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be a goal for Swift 4, but is impractical to achieve for a Swift 3.x<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; release. It also provides us a general framework in the future for handling<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; source compatibility as Swift evolves.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To make this more concrete, suppose an application is written to use<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift 4, but uses packages via SwiftPM that are written using Swift 3. A<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; single compiler would build both the app and the packages — thus ensuring<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that all the compiled sources are binary compatible. It would not be the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; case that a framework built with the Swift 3 compiler could be used by an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; app built using the Swift 4 compiler. That kind of library binary stability<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (ABI) will be a key goal of the Swift 4 release.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These constraints mentioned above will serve as scaffolding for Swift 4<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; development. Discussion about Swift 4 commences on Monday. Ahead of that,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Chris Lattner plans to send out thoughts from the Core team on some of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; known key goals (and non-goals) for the release. In the meantime, the focus<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over the next couple days should be taking stock of what has landed for<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift 3 and to see if any of the proposals mentioned above are close to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being completed or are truly out of scope.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you again to everyone for making Swift 3 such as fantastic<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; release!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ted<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160728/18c7c1a0/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c69b8eb4df5af15923fd1647a8276890?s=50"></div><header><strong>End of source-breaking changes for Swift 3</strong> from <string>John McCall</string> &lt;rjmccall at apple.com&gt;<p>July 28, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jul 28, 2016, at 8:30 AM, Brian Gesiak &lt;modocache at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; Apologies if this was announced elsewhere: is commit access to master restricted?<br></p><p>It was, for about a day.

Some of these proposals have implementations actively underway. For those proposals already in active development — and near completion — I am okay with extending the deadline for those changes to Friday, July 29. Such changes need to be approved by the release manager (myself) and should be merged into master via a pull request. When creating the pull request, please assign it to me (tkremenek), and mention the pull request on the swift-dev mailing list as well with the SE number in the email title.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The rest of the unimplemented proposals do not make Swift 3. This leaves us with the question of what to do with them. These proposals represent the known and reviewed changes we want to make to Swift, but inevitably there will also be changes that we don&#39;t even know about today that we will want to take into Swift that can impact core source stability. That said, we also have a very strong desire to maintain source compatibility with Swift 3 and Swift 4 as much as possible to provide some stability for which Swift users to build upon. The challenge of course is reconciling these diametrically opposing goals: maintaining source stability while having the ability to incorporate more core (and important) language changes that are possibly source-breaking.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The Swift team at Apple has reflected on this and decided what it &quot;means&quot; for Swift 3 to be source compatible with Swift 4 and later releases going forward. Our goal is to allow app developers to combine a mix of Swift modules (e.g., SwiftPM packages), where each module is known to compile with a specific version of the language (module A works with Swift 3, module B works with Swift 3.1, etc.), then combine those modules into a single binary. The key feature is that a module can be migrated from Swift 3 to 3.1 to 4 (and beyond) independently of its dependencies.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; While the exact details of how we will accomplish this feat are still being discussed, here is a sketch of how this will likely work in the Swift 4 timeframe. The key enabler is a new compiler flag that indicates the language version to compile for (e.g., similar to the clang -std=c99 flag). The compiler flag will be provided by the build system you are using (e.g., Xcode, SwiftPM, etc.) on a per-module basis:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; For language syntax/semantics, the compiler can use the language mode to properly implement the language version being used by a module.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; For the Standard Library, additive and subtractive changes are easily handled (the former by just adding them, the later by using deprecation techniques). For semantics changes, things are much more complicated, and will need further study.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The great thing about this approach is that a single Swift 4 compiler is building all of the sources in an application. This allows us to roll out this approach before achieving full ABI stability — something that will be a goal for Swift 4, but is impractical to achieve for a Swift 3.x release. It also provides us a general framework in the future for handling source compatibility as Swift evolves.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; To make this more concrete, suppose an application is written to use Swift 4, but uses packages via SwiftPM that are written using Swift 3. A single compiler would build both the app and the packages — thus ensuring that all the compiled sources are binary compatible. It would not be the case that a framework built with the Swift 3 compiler could be used by an app built using the Swift 4 compiler. That kind of library binary stability (ABI) will be a key goal of the Swift 4 release.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; These constraints mentioned above will serve as scaffolding for Swift 4 development. Discussion about Swift 4 commences on Monday. Ahead of that, Chris Lattner plans to send out thoughts from the Core team on some of the known key goals (and non-goals) for the release. In the meantime, the focus over the next couple days should be taking stock of what has landed for Swift 3 and to see if any of the proposals mentioned above are close to being completed or are truly out of scope.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thank you again to everyone for making Swift 3 such as fantastic release!<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Ted<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160728/45cc7c83/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8aa3a9da9a32d3e98805b4a5409e4cee?s=50"></div><header><strong>End of source-breaking changes for Swift 3</strong> from <string>Anton Zhilin</string> &lt;antonyzhilin at gmail.com&gt;<p>July 29, 2016 at 04:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>Fantastic!
