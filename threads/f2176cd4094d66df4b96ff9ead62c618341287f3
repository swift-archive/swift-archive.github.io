The previously-stated goals still apply:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; * describe when and where to use argument labels<br>&gt;&gt; * require labels in many of the cases people have asked for them<br>&gt;&gt; * are understandable by humans (this means relatively simple)<br>&gt;&gt; * preserve important semantics communicated by existing APIs.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Please keep in mind that it is a non-goal to capture considerations we<br>&gt;&gt; think have a bearing on good names (such as relatedness of parameters):<br>&gt;&gt; it&#39;s to create simple guidelines that have the right effect in nearly<br>&gt;&gt; all cases.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; A. When arguments can&#39;t be usefully distinguished from one another, none<br>&gt;&gt;   should have argument labels, e.g. min(x,y), zip(x,y,z).  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; B. Otherwise,<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  1. At the call site, a first parameter that has no argument label must<br>&gt;&gt;     form part of a grammatical phrase that starts with the basename, less<br>&gt;&gt;     any trailing nouns.  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;       print(x)<br>&gt;&gt;       a.contains(b)<br>&gt;&gt;       a.mergeWith(b)<br>&gt;&gt;       a.addGestureRecognizer(x)<br>&gt;&gt;            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ trailing noun<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;     This phrase must have the correct semantic implications, so, e.g.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;       a.dismiss(b)           // no, unless a is really dismissing b<br>&gt;&gt;       a.dismissAnimated(b)   // no, not grammatical<br>&gt;&gt;       a.dismiss(animated: b) // yes, using a label<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  2. If the first argument is part of a prepositional phrase, put the<br>&gt;&gt;     parenthesis immediately after the preposition. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;       a.encodeWith(b)<br>&gt;&gt;       a.moveFrom(b, to: c)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;     Thus, if words are required for any reason between the preposition<br>&gt;&gt;     and the first argument, they go into the first argument label.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;       a.tracksWith(mediaType: b, composer: c)<br>&gt;&gt;       a.moveTo(x: 22, y: 99)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Notes: <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; a. I would recommend prepositions other than &quot;with&quot; in nearly all<br>&gt;&gt;   cases, but that&#39;s not the point of these rules.<br>&gt;&gt; b. I can understand the aesthetic appeal of<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;    a.move(from: b, to: c)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;   but I believe it is not a clear enough improvement to justify<br>&gt;&gt;   additional complexity in the guidelines.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Questions:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 1. I&#39;m not expecting these guidelines to make everybody optimally happy,<br>&gt;&gt;   all the time, but they shouldn&#39;t be harmful.  Are there any cases for<br>&gt;&gt;   which they produce results you couldn&#39;t live with?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 2. Are there any cases where you&#39;d be confused about how to apply these<br>&gt;&gt;   guidelines?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance for all your valuable input!<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; P.S. Doug is presently working on generating new importer results, based<br>&gt;&gt;     on these guidelines, for your perusal.  They should be ready soon.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; -- <br>&gt;&gt; -Dave<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3488bcf34d8c45d917ed27d67a0ffa45?s=50"></div><header><strong>When to use argument labels, part DEUX</strong> from <string>David Hart</string> &lt;david at hartbit.com&gt;<p>February  6, 2016 at 02:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Again, I understand the aesthetic preference for this form; I even<br>&gt; prefer it myself.
