A primary<br>&gt; goal of Swift 3 was to provide source compatibility going forward.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -Chris<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Since the weak-capturing pattern is only really desirable for @escaping<br>&gt; closures, and (I think) it would be the usual preference, could @escaping<br>&gt; also imply weak-capturing for all references (not just self)? Then there<br>&gt; would be another syntax for strong-capturing-escaping closures.<br>&gt; Non-escaping closures could a) strongly capture references; or b) existing<br>&gt; strong references stay strong and weak ones stay weak, meaning no<br>&gt; ref-counts need to change at all when passing them.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Thu, 29 Sep 2016 at 00:06 Paul Jack via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; So previously there were a few threads on the &quot;strong self/weak self<br>&gt;&gt; dance&quot; but they didn&#39;t seem to get anywhere. For instance:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160201/008713.html<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160215/010759.html<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160208/009972.html<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ...and possibly others.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I&#39;d like to propose something even easier (and more specific) than all<br>&gt;&gt; of the above discussions. Specifically, I&#39;d like to introduce a new<br>&gt;&gt; automagic closure variable, $self, whose presence in a closure would<br>&gt;&gt; cause that closure to weakly capture self in a safe manner.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; As a concrete example, let&#39;s imagine a UIViewController for a login<br>&gt;&gt; form. Under this proposal, the following code:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; func viewDidLoad() {<br>&gt;&gt;     self.loginForm.onSubmit = {<br>&gt;&gt;          let f = $self.loginForm<br>&gt;&gt;          $self.startLoginRequest(email:f.email.text, pwd:f.pwd.text)<br>&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ...would be treated by the compiler as equivalent to:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; func viewDidLoad() {<br>&gt;&gt;     self.loginForm.onSubmit = {<br>&gt;&gt;          [weak self] in<br>&gt;&gt;          if let selfie = self {<br>&gt;&gt;              let f = selfie.loginForm<br>&gt;&gt;              selfie.startLoginRequest(email:f.email.text,<br>&gt;&gt;              pwd:f.pwd.text)<br>&gt;&gt;          }<br>&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Note the &quot;if let&quot; there: If self no longer exists, the closure does not<br>&gt;&gt; execute at all, but if self does exist, then it exists for the entirety<br>&gt;&gt; of the execution of the closure (ie, self won&#39;t vanish as a side-effect<br>&gt;&gt; of some statement in the closure.) I think these semantics obey the<br>&gt;&gt; principle of least surprise; $self can be treated by the developer as a<br>&gt;&gt; strong reference.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; However, that does mean that $self can only be used in a closure that&#39;s<br>&gt;&gt; (a) Void or (b) Optional. In the latter case, returning nil when self<br>&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t exist seems like reasonable/expected behavior.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; It would be a compile-time error to use both $self and normal self in<br>&gt;&gt; the same closure.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I&#39;d like to keep this simple, meaning $self always does the above and<br>&gt;&gt; nothing else. So, if you need an unowned self, you still need the<br>&gt;&gt; original syntax; if your closure needs a non-Optional return type, you<br>&gt;&gt; still need the original syntax; etc.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Thoughts?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; -Paul<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160929/d71228eb/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
