It&#39;s good as it is.<br></p><p>First, there&#39;s an important precedent for UpperCamelCase enums in other languages that Swift has some kinship with, e.g. C#, Rust, and Scala. People coming to Swift from these languages immediately feel at home with the current guideline.<br></p><p>Second, there&#39;s an even bigger precedent for treating enums differently from other identifiers. In languages where UpperCamelCase isn&#39;t the rule, e.g. C, C++, and Java, the practice is often to name enums using UPPERCASE. This says something about how people see enums: as something that should stand out. Making them lowerCamelCase goes against this.<br></p><p>Finally, using UpperCamelCase makes enums much more readable when used with Swifts&#39;s ability to infer the enum type. It&#39;s immediately clear that this is an enum:<br></p><p>suit = .Hearts<br></p><p>But it&#39;s not so clear what this is:<br></p><p>suit = .hearts<br></p><p>What is hearts? Is it a property? Where does it come from? This makes the language harder to learn and harder to read.<br></p><p>Consistency should be a goal when it aids clarity and readability. In this case, it would make code less clear and less readable, and it would go against established practice.<br></p><p>/Jonathan<br></p><p>&gt; 22 dec. 2015 kl. 03:38 skrev Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Dec 21, 2015, at 3:58 PM, Michael Wells via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I love that Swift has a published API design guidelines at https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines.html, but one thing about it bugs me: the use of UpperCamelCase for cases.
