Jack L from Apple convinced me to avoid the word &quot;feature&quot; as well, since the platform conditions refer to mutually exclusive environments (&quot;os(OSX)&quot; vs. &quot;os(iOS)&quot;), while &quot;features&quot; can usually be mixed.<br></p><p>Jordan<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
