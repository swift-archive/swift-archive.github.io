Personally, I’d prefer that the first argument always<br>&gt; include a label, but I know that is not a popular opinion.<br></p><p>What would you use for a label here, and why?<br></p><p>  someSet.remove(someElement)<br></p><p>&gt; I continue to believe that property access implies (or at least<br>&gt; strongly hints) at O(1)<br></p><p>+1. For the record, I think the strongest expression of this fact<br>we&#39;re going to be able to get approved is already in the guidelines:<br>&quot;document the complexity of any computed property that is not O(1)&quot;<br></p><p>&gt; WRT translation from ObjC to Swift a few things come to mind:<br></p><p>Would you mind posting these thoughts in the review thread of SE-0005?<br></p><p>&gt; Import things like[UIColor blueColor] to Swift as UIColor.blue instead<br>&gt; of UIColor.blueColor(). That is, things that feel like static<br>&gt; properties on a class should be imported that way.<br>&gt; Are singleton accessors methods or properties? [NSNotificationCenter<br>&gt; defaultCenter]imports as NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter() or<br>&gt; NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter?<br>&gt; Group string encoding constants (and other constants like this)<br>&gt; together in an enum or struct. I can never remember<br>&gt; NSUTF8StringEncoding since I’m always looking for StringEncoding<br>&gt; first.<br>&gt; I know this is out of scope for this review, but I’d love for the<br>&gt; guidelines to go even further in defining canonical Swift. What about,<br>&gt; dare I say it, brace locations, tab-vs-spaces, how to wrap func<br>&gt; definitions within some column width max, etc? From the sample code it<br>&gt; appears that Apple has adopted a Swift style and it might be nice to<br>&gt; make that public. This public style guide would not be a decree of<br>&gt; &quot;how one must write&quot; Swift, but more as a &quot;this is how the core team<br>&gt; writes&quot; Swift. I’m one of those developers that has no strong<br>&gt; preference for these issues, but I really do value consistency.<br></p><p>I can imagine we&#39;d address these kinds of things in later review cycles.<br>Regardless, I think we probably need a separate set of guidelines for<br>standard library code, just to cover some of the conventions we use<br>there but don&#39;t expect to impose on everyone else.  That could serve as<br>your guide to the core team&#39;s practices.<br></p><p>&gt; Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Most definitely.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes these guidelines makes a huge difference in how the language<br>&gt; feels. It fits perfectly with the direction of Swift.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature,<br>&gt; how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I&#39;ve been a big proponent of design guides in all of the languages<br>&gt; I’ve used: C, C++, Java, C#, Objective C, and now Swift. I really<br>&gt; appreciate where languages make opinionated decisions on how to write<br>&gt; idiomatic code.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I’ve read the proposals many times and I’ve been actively following this discussion.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; On Jan 31, 2016, at 9:29 PM, Ricardo Parada via swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt; &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Proposal link:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0023-api-guidelines.md<br>&gt;&gt; &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0023-api-guidelines.md&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt;&gt; +1<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I read the guidelines and I like them a lot in general. I think they are a very good start. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I have read the alternatives and disagreements in the discussion<br>&gt;&gt; threads.  However, in my opinion the guidelines still stand as the<br>&gt;&gt; winner. I find it better, simpler, more concise and better looking<br>&gt;&gt; than the alternatives discussed.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; For example the ed/ ing ending for non-mutable methods. This is a<br>&gt;&gt; convention I have used in java for a long time and I found it very<br>&gt;&gt; natural in general even when the English language may not cooperate<br>&gt;&gt; as it has been discussed by others. I got used to this convention<br>&gt;&gt; very quickly many years ago in libraries I use in java.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; There is only one guideline that I think is not aligned with the<br>&gt;&gt; consensus I seem to pick up from the discussions. That is the use of<br>&gt;&gt; camel case for enum cases. After reading different opinions I am now<br>&gt;&gt; leaning towards saying that Enum cases should be lower camel case<br>&gt;&gt; given that they are values.  At first my opinion was the same as the<br>&gt;&gt; guideline. After reading the discussions and seeing examples I<br>&gt;&gt; changed my mind.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt;&gt; This will bring a lot of changes when applied. I think they are a<br>&gt;&gt; good start. I don&#39;t think it should cover all cases.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I saw the loginWithUserName(_:password:) example and alternatives:<br>&gt;&gt; login(userName:password:), etc. I don&#39;t know if this is addressed in<br>&gt;&gt; the guidelines. I don&#39;t think this example falls under the weak type<br>&gt;&gt; first argument.  It would be nice to have some guidance here. I do<br>&gt;&gt; not know how to state it but I think in this case I would say<br>&gt;&gt; login(userName:password:) is better as it could be part of a family<br>&gt;&gt; of login() methods that take different parameters, i.e. credentials.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt;&gt; Definitely. I find the guidelines are concise, natural and easy to get used to. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar<br>&gt;&gt; feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt;&gt; I have used Java libraries for many years that use the ed ending for<br>&gt;&gt; non-mutable methods for example.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick<br>&gt;&gt; reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt;&gt; I read the proposal entirely and I have read the majority of responses in the mailing list. <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3488bcf34d8c45d917ed27d67a0ffa45?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0023 API Design Guidelines</strong> from <string>David Hart</string> &lt;david at hartbit.com&gt;<p>February  2, 2016 at 06:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On 02 Feb 2016, at 01:38, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I’m a big fan of guidelines like these so count me as a strong +1.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; In general<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I’m supportive of lowerCamelCase for enumerations. <br>&gt;&gt; I’m still not sure about the first argument label<br>&gt;&gt; suggestions.
