I am asking here as a last resource if it can be done yet or there is a better design. <br></p><p>The answer here is the same as the answer you&#39;ve gotten from those other excellent resources.<br></p><p>Here&#39;s the issue: Imagine that Swift supported this feature. You write this line of code:<br></p><p>	let event0 = events[0]<br>	let event1 = events[1]<br>	event0.doSomething(event1.interval)<br></p><p>Is this code valid? Well, who knows? `event0` and `event1` might have different Interval types, or might not.<br></p><p>Java&#39;s type system does not try to protect you from this kind of mistake; Swift&#39;s does. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not yet expressive enough to describe the types involved. Consider this snippet:<br></p><p>	let event = events[0]<br>	let interval = event.interval<br></p><p>What&#39;s the type of `interval`? There&#39;s no way you can know for sure, really. All you can really say is &quot;whatever the `IntervalType` of `event` is&quot;.<br></p><p>There are proposals in the works to actually allow you to say `event.IntervalType` as a type, but unfortunately they won&#39;t make Swift 3. Until that feature is added, you have three options:<br></p><p>1. Fake that intended future Swift feature by writing `AnyInterval` and `AnyEvent` type-erasing wrappers.<br>2. Halfway fake it by writing an `AnyEvent&lt;IntervalType&gt;` type-erasing wrapper.<br>3. Remove the associated type and require that any `Event` work with any `Interval` (or make `Interval` a concrete type).<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/552a3e0dcef60ac896560e0c8f4baf5b?s=50"></div><header><strong>Array with associatedtype protocol pattern</strong> from <string>Karl</string> &lt;razielim at gmail.com&gt;<p>July 15, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On 13 Jul 2016, at 20:23, 4 bottiglie g via swift-dev &lt;swift-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hi, i have asked the same question :<br>&gt; Here: https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/153781#153781 &lt;https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/153781#153781&gt;<br>&gt; And here : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38281800/array-with-associatedtype-protocol &lt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38281800/array-with-associatedtype-protocol&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; But it seams like swift doesn’t have generic protocols arrays.
