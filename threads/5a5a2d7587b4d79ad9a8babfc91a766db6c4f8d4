Usiyan</string> &lt;griotspeak at gmail.com&gt;<p>December 28, 2015 at 11:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>I only have a  vague idea for syntax but I would very much like influence<br>on the order and grouping the generated interface beyond what we can do<br>with extensions.<br></p><p>One idea is to bring back names for extensions (Bring back in the sense<br>that categories had names.). The names wouldn&#39;t need to have any<br>significance. We could then use the names to create  manifest which could<br>influence the order of the generated header. Anything not listed in the<br>manifest would appear after the explicitly listed items.<br></p><p>This could have an added benefit for moving around in the IDE as well.<br>Extension names could be used in the jump bar and Open Quickly, at least in<br>theory.They could be completely erased at compile time or they could stick<br>around, I&#39;m not sure which would be preferable.<br></p><p>TJ<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151228/5a5af8d4/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
