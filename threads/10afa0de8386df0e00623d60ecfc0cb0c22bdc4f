But even leaving that aside, I have a few questions and critiques.<br></p><p>&gt; A common case is the UIView from UIKit. Many developers are tempted to make this call:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; view.layoutSubviews()<br>&gt; The documentation says: &quot;You should not call this method directly. If you want to force a layout update, call the setNeedsLayoutmethod instead to do so prior to the next drawing update. If you want to update the layout of your views immediately, call the layoutIfNeeded method.&quot;<br></p><p>This example is illuminating in several ways.<br></p><p>* The rule is not simply that &quot;only the class should call `layoutSubviews()`&quot;; it is effectively &quot;*you* should never call `layoutSubviews()` except when `super`ing up from your override&quot;. Calling `layoutSubviews()` from `insertRows(at:)` is just as much a mistake if `insertRows(at:)` is part of the class as if it is not. So isn&#39;t `protected` insufficiently strict to properly serve this use case?<br></p><p>* At the same time, something outside `layoutSubviews()` has to be able to call `layoutSubviews()`. In the case of UIKit, though, that &quot;something&quot; is always within UIKit itself, never outside it. So should `protected` have a &quot;bottom&quot;, a level below which calls are unrestricted? For instance, in UIKit&#39;s case you might have `protected fileprivate`, meaning &quot;anything up to `fileprivate` has unrestricted use; anything above that can override and `super` up from its override, but not use it any other way&quot;.<br></p><p>	protected fileprivate func layoutSubviews()<br></p><p>* `layoutSubviews()` is also something you should probably always `super` up to. Have you considered addressing `super` requirements at all?<br></p><p>In short, is a traditional `protected` really the feature you want to handle this use case, or would a very different design actually suit it a lot better?<br></p><p>&gt; When declarated by a class the protected member will be visible to the class itself and all the derived classes.<br></p><p>In what scope? The same as the class?<br></p><p>Is there not room for, for instance, &quot;usable without restriction in this file, override-only in the rest of this module, invisible outside it&quot;? For instance, `internal(protected) fileprivate`, or perhaps `internal(override) fileprivate`? `layoutSubviews()` might then be `public(override) fileprivate`—the ability to override is public, the ability to use it unrestricted is filewide.<br></p><p>	public(override) fileprivate func layoutSubviews()<br>	internal(override) fileprivate func privateSubclassingHook()<br></p><p>&gt; public protected(set) var x = 20<br></p><p>Of course, that might be difficult to combine with the `(set)` syntax. `public(set: override)`, maybe? With, for instance, `public internal(set: override) private(set)` if you want the property&#39;s getter public and its setter overridable internally and callable in private scope.<br></p><p>	public(override) fileprivate func layoutSubviews()<br>	internal(override) fileprivate func privateSubclassingHook()<br>	public(get, set: override) internal(set) var x = 20<br></p><p>But there&#39;s something about this that&#39;s starting to seem a little rotten. I think the problem is that we&#39;re not really trying to widen the ability to override, we&#39;re trying to restrict the ability to call. Let&#39;s try restructuring along those lines:<br></p><p>	public fileprivate(call) func layoutSubviews()<br>	internal fileprivate(call) func privateSubclassingHook()<br>	public internal(set: call) var x = 20<br></p><p>That seems much cleaner to me.<br></p><p>&gt; If the member is declared as final then it will be visible but not can be overrided by the derived classes. Just like it works with other access levels.<br></p><p>With the &quot;overridable but otherwise unusable&quot; conception I&#39;m suggesting, this would not be the case, of course.<br></p><p>&gt; Protocols<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Protocols do not declare access level for their members. So the protected access level is not applicable here.<br></p><p>But `protected` is quite different from other access levels; it does not limit the visibility of the symbols, but rather their use. And protocols face the same sort of problem as classes, where certain members are essentially override hooks and shouldn&#39;t be called directly outside a particular scope.<br></p><p>So I think we ought to allow `accesslevel(call)`, but not a plain `accesslevel`:<br></p><p>	public fileprivate(call) func layoutSubviews()<br>	internal fileprivate(call) func privateSubclassingHook()<br>	public internal(set: call) var x = 20<br>	internal(call) func protocolConformanceHook()<br>	fileprivate(set: call) var onlyProtocolSetsThis: Int { get set }<br></p><p>&gt; Extensions<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Extensions will not be able do be protected nor their members.<br></p><p>This is very vague. There are several things extensions might try to do with protected members:<br></p><p>* Declare new ones<br>* Override existing ones<br>* Call existing ones<br></p><p>Which of these, if any, are permitted? Why?<br></p><p>In my conception, I would permit extensions to behave as the type they extended did. Extensions could declare new members with restricted calling and override existing ones. They would not be able to call, except when supering from an override, unless they were within scope of the `call` access control. In other words, they&#39;d behave just like any other code at that location. That&#39;s how we want extensions to work.<br></p><p>&gt; But nested declarations will be allowed, so this code will compile:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; // We can declare a protected class (or struct, enum, etc.) if<br>&gt; // and only if they are nested inside other type.<br>&gt; public class MyPublicClass {<br>&gt;    protected <br>&gt; class MyProtectedClass {<br></p><p>What does it mean to &quot;use&quot; a protected class, though? Clearly you can call its methods, if only through AnyObject or a non-protected superclass or a protocol it conforms to. Does it mean you can&#39;t instantiate it? Does it mean you can&#39;t subclass it? Does it mean you can&#39;t call methods that aren&#39;t on its supertypes? All of the above? None?<br></p><p>One more thing that didn&#39;t come up: Testability. I believe that importing a module with `@testable` should disable its call restrictions, even ones inherited from outside that module.

Calling `layoutSubviews()` from `insertRows(at:)` is just as much a mistake if `insertRows(at:)` is part of the class as if it is not. So isn&#39;t `protected` insufficiently strict to properly serve this use case?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * At the same time, something outside `layoutSubviews()` has to be able to call `layoutSubviews()`. In the case of UIKit, though, that &quot;something&quot; is always within UIKit itself, never outside it. So should `protected` have a &quot;bottom&quot;, a level below which calls are unrestricted? For instance, in UIKit&#39;s case you might have `protected fileprivate`, meaning &quot;anything up to `fileprivate` has unrestricted use; anything above that can override and `super` up from its override, but not use it any other way&quot;.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    protected fileprivate func layoutSubviews()<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * `layoutSubviews()` is also something you should probably always `super` up to. Have you considered addressing `super` requirements at all?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In short, is a traditional `protected` really the feature you want to handle this use case, or would a very different design actually suit it a lot better?<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; When declarated by a class the protected member will be visible to the class itself and all the derived classes.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In what scope? The same as the class?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Is there not room for, for instance, &quot;usable without restriction in this file, override-only in the rest of this module, invisible outside it&quot;? For instance, `internal(protected) fileprivate`, or perhaps `internal(override) fileprivate`? `layoutSubviews()` might then be `public(override) fileprivate`—the ability to override is public, the ability to use it unrestricted is filewide.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    public(override) fileprivate func layoutSubviews()<br>&gt;    internal(override) fileprivate func privateSubclassingHook()<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; public protected(set) var x = 20<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Of course, that might be difficult to combine with the `(set)` syntax. `public(set: override)`, maybe? With, for instance, `public internal(set: override) private(set)` if you want the property&#39;s getter public and its setter overridable internally and callable in private scope.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    public(override) fileprivate func layoutSubviews()<br>&gt;    internal(override) fileprivate func privateSubclassingHook()<br>&gt;    public(get, set: override) internal(set) var x = 20<br>&gt; <br>&gt; But there&#39;s something about this that&#39;s starting to seem a little rotten. I think the problem is that we&#39;re not really trying to widen the ability to override, we&#39;re trying to restrict the ability to call. Let&#39;s try restructuring along those lines:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    public fileprivate(call) func layoutSubviews()<br>&gt;    internal fileprivate(call) func privateSubclassingHook()<br>&gt;    public internal(set: call) var x = 20<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That seems much cleaner to me.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; If the member is declared as final then it will be visible but not can be overrided by the derived classes. Just like it works with other access levels.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; With the &quot;overridable but otherwise unusable&quot; conception I&#39;m suggesting, this would not be the case, of course.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Protocols<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Protocols do not declare access level for their members. So the protected access level is not applicable here.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; But `protected` is quite different from other access levels; it does not limit the visibility of the symbols, but rather their use. And protocols face the same sort of problem as classes, where certain members are essentially override hooks and shouldn&#39;t be called directly outside a particular scope.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; So I think we ought to allow `accesslevel(call)`, but not a plain `accesslevel`:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    public fileprivate(call) func layoutSubviews()<br>&gt;    internal fileprivate(call) func privateSubclassingHook()<br>&gt;    public internal(set: call) var x = 20<br>&gt;    internal(call) func protocolConformanceHook()<br>&gt;    fileprivate(set: call) var onlyProtocolSetsThis: Int { get set }<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Extensions<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Extensions will not be able do be protected nor their members.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This is very vague. There are several things extensions might try to do with protected members:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * Declare new ones<br>&gt; * Override existing ones<br>&gt; * Call existing ones<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Which of these, if any, are permitted? Why?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In my conception, I would permit extensions to behave as the type they extended did. Extensions could declare new members with restricted calling and override existing ones. They would not be able to call, except when supering from an override, unless they were within scope of the `call` access control. In other words, they&#39;d behave just like any other code at that location. That&#39;s how we want extensions to work.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; But nested declarations will be allowed, so this code will compile:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; // We can declare a protected class (or struct, enum, etc.) if<br>&gt;&gt; // and only if they are nested inside other type.<br>&gt;&gt; public class MyPublicClass {<br>&gt;&gt;   protected <br>&gt;&gt; class MyProtectedClass {<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What does it mean to &quot;use&quot; a protected class, though? Clearly you can call its methods, if only through AnyObject or a non-protected superclass or a protocol it conforms to. Does it mean you can&#39;t instantiate it? Does it mean you can&#39;t subclass it? Does it mean you can&#39;t call methods that aren&#39;t on its supertypes? All of the above? None?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; One more thing that didn&#39;t come up: Testability. I believe that importing a module with `@testable` should disable its call restrictions, even ones inherited from outside that module. Thus, even if *you* cannot call your `layoutSubviews()`, your test suite can.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; So, in short, my counter-proposal is:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    public fileprivate(call) func layoutSubviews()<br>&gt;    internal fileprivate(call) func privateSubclassingHook()<br>&gt;    public internal(set: call) var x = 20<br>&gt;    internal(call) func protocolConformanceHook()<br>&gt;    fileprivate(set: call) var onlyProtocolSetsThis: Int { get set }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In other words:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * There is a new aspect of the member, `call`, which controls the ability to actually call the member, as opposed to overriding it.

For instance, in UIKit&#39;s case you might have `protected fileprivate`, meaning &quot;anything up to `fileprivate` has unrestricted use; anything above that can override and `super` up from its override, but not use it any other way&quot;.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  protected fileprivate func layoutSubviews()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * `layoutSubviews()` is also something you should probably always `super` up to. Have you considered addressing `super` requirements at all?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; In short, is a traditional `protected` really the feature you want to handle this use case, or would a very different design actually suit it a lot better?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When declarated by a class the protected member will be visible to the class itself and all the derived classes.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; In what scope? The same as the class?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there not room for, for instance, &quot;usable without restriction in this file, override-only in the rest of this module, invisible outside it&quot;? For instance, `internal(protected) fileprivate`, or perhaps `internal(override) fileprivate`? `layoutSubviews()` might then be `public(override) fileprivate`—the ability to override is public, the ability to use it unrestricted is filewide.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  public(override) fileprivate func layoutSubviews()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  internal(override) fileprivate func privateSubclassingHook()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; public protected(set) var x = 20<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, that might be difficult to combine with the `(set)` syntax. `public(set: override)`, maybe? With, for instance, `public internal(set: override) private(set)` if you want the property&#39;s getter public and its setter overridable internally and callable in private scope.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  public(override) fileprivate func layoutSubviews()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  internal(override) fileprivate func privateSubclassingHook()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  public(get, set: override) internal(set) var x = 20<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; But there&#39;s something about this that&#39;s starting to seem a little rotten. I think the problem is that we&#39;re not really trying to widen the ability to override, we&#39;re trying to restrict the ability to call. Let&#39;s try restructuring along those lines:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  public fileprivate(call) func layoutSubviews()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  internal fileprivate(call) func privateSubclassingHook()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  public internal(set: call) var x = 20<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; That seems much cleaner to me.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If the member is declared as final then it will be visible but not can be overrided by the derived classes. Just like it works with other access levels.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; With the &quot;overridable but otherwise unusable&quot; conception I&#39;m suggesting, this would not be the case, of course.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Protocols<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Protocols do not declare access level for their members. So the protected access level is not applicable here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; But `protected` is quite different from other access levels; it does not limit the visibility of the symbols, but rather their use. And protocols face the same sort of problem as classes, where certain members are essentially override hooks and shouldn&#39;t be called directly outside a particular scope.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; So I think we ought to allow `accesslevel(call)`, but not a plain `accesslevel`:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  public fileprivate(call) func layoutSubviews()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  internal fileprivate(call) func privateSubclassingHook()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  public internal(set: call) var x = 20<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  internal(call) func protocolConformanceHook()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  fileprivate(set: call) var onlyProtocolSetsThis: Int { get set }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Extensions<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Extensions will not be able do be protected nor their members.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This is very vague. There are several things extensions might try to do with protected members:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Declare new ones<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Override existing ones<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Call existing ones<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Which of these, if any, are permitted? Why?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; In my conception, I would permit extensions to behave as the type they extended did. Extensions could declare new members with restricted calling and override existing ones. They would not be able to call, except when supering from an override, unless they were within scope of the `call` access control. In other words, they&#39;d behave just like any other code at that location. That&#39;s how we want extensions to work.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But nested declarations will be allowed, so this code will compile:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // We can declare a protected class (or struct, enum, etc.) if<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // and only if they are nested inside other type.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; public class MyPublicClass {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; protected <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyProtectedClass {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; What does it mean to &quot;use&quot; a protected class, though? Clearly you can call its methods, if only through AnyObject or a non-protected superclass or a protocol it conforms to. Does it mean you can&#39;t instantiate it? Does it mean you can&#39;t subclass it? Does it mean you can&#39;t call methods that aren&#39;t on its supertypes? All of the above? None?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; One more thing that didn&#39;t come up: Testability. I believe that importing a module with `@testable` should disable its call restrictions, even ones inherited from outside that module. Thus, even if *you* cannot call your `layoutSubviews()`, your test suite can.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; So, in short, my counter-proposal is:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  public fileprivate(call) func layoutSubviews()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  internal fileprivate(call) func privateSubclassingHook()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  public internal(set: call) var x = 20<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  internal(call) func protocolConformanceHook()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  fileprivate(set: call) var onlyProtocolSetsThis: Int { get set }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * There is a new aspect of the member, `call`, which controls the ability to actually call the member, as opposed to overriding it. No `call`, no calling (except when `super`ing up from an override).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * `call` is used in combination with one of the existing access modifiers: `public(call)` `internal(call)` `fileprivate(call)` `private(call)`. `call`&#39;s visibility is always less or equal to the member itself.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * To control the callability of a setter independently from both the getter and the overridability of the setter, use `set: call`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Extensions behave just like type definitions at the same location with regards to `call`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Protocols can use access modifiers with `call` to prevent unauthorized code from calling a member. The access control level to implement a member continues to be as wide as the access control level of the protocol itself.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * `@testable` disables `call` restrictions on the types it imports, so the test suite can call any visible member, even ones inherited from other modules.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * There should probably also be some sort of &quot;super required&quot; warning/error, but this is an orthogonal feature and can be left for a separate proposal.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that feature will be closer to the one you actually *want*, as opposed to the one that other languages have cargo-culted from SIMULA-67.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -- <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Brent Royal-Gordon<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Architechies<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b3f5abbe48b7127e20fd69808c714bf?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal] Protected Access Level</strong> from <string>Charlie Monroe</string> &lt;charlie at charliemonroe.net&gt;<p>May 29, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>I agree - both will need to be addressed in the future to make the language complete.

There are several convenience methods + properties I have exposed for subclasses to use, but they should really be implementation details; a client using these model objects should not have to know about them. Even worse, several of the properties are mutable so the subclasses can modify them, but they certainly should *not* be modified by anything else.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Right now, I&#39;m limited to simply commenting something akin to &quot;DO NOT CALL&quot; next to these methods/properties, which definitely goes against Swift&#39;s safety focus.

Many developers are tempted to make this call:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; view.layoutSubviews()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The documentation says: &quot;You should not call this method directly. If you want to force a layout update, call the setNeedsLayoutmethod instead to do so prior to the next drawing update. If you want to update the layout of your views immediately, call the layoutIfNeeded method.&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This example is illuminating in several ways.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * The rule is not simply that &quot;only the class should call `layoutSubviews()`&quot;; it is effectively &quot;*you* should never call `layoutSubviews()` except when `super`ing up from your override&quot;. Calling `layoutSubviews()` from `insertRows(at:)` is just as much a mistake if `insertRows(at:)` is part of the class as if it is not.

There are several convenience methods + properties I have exposed for subclasses to use, but they should really be implementation details; a client using these model objects should not have to know about them. Even worse, several of the properties are mutable so the subclasses can modify them, but they certainly should *not* be modified by anything else.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Right now, I&#39;m limited to simply commenting something akin to &quot;DO NOT CALL&quot; next to these methods/properties, which definitely goes against Swift&#39;s safety focus. For these reasons, I&#39;m 100% in support of a protected access control modifier.<br></p><p>That&#39;s a little bit of a different use case than the `layoutSubviews()` case discussed in the proposal.<br></p><p>My answer is this: There is nothing magical about being a subclass that ought to grant access to those methods. For instance, if your subclass grows very complicated and you extract a helper object, it&#39;s perfectly reasonable for that helper object to want to access the &quot;subclass-only&quot; API. Contrarily, simple subclasses might not need that API, and exposing it to them would be an unnecessary risk. And there are things which you don&#39;t subclass at all which could benefit from being hidden away—think of the Objective-C runtime, which has some parts which every app needs (like the definition of `BOOL`) and other parts which are extraordinarily dangerous and should only be available to code which needs it (like `method_exchangeImplementations`).<br></p><p>The Objective-C solution—using a separate header file—actually acknowledges this fact. Even though the header is called &quot;UIGestureRecognizerSubclass.h&quot;, it is not really limited to subclasses; any code can import and use that API. It&#39;s just sectioned off *by default*, like keeping all the kitchen knives in a sharps drawer. And the Objective-C runtime, which doesn&#39;t contain (many) classes, can use this approach too: &lt;objc/objc.h&gt; is implicitly available, while &lt;objc/runtime.h&gt; is something you have to ask for explicitly.<br></p><p>There are a few ways you could bring this same &quot;sharps drawer&quot; approach to Swift. For instance—without adding any language features—you could create an ancillary struct which merely serves to segregate all the dangerous APIs:<br></p><p>	public class UIGestureRecognizer {<br>		public private(set) var state: UIGestureRecognizerState {...}<br>		<br>		private func ignoreTouch(touch: UITouch, forEvent event: UIEvent) {...}<br>		private func reset() {...}<br>		<br>		// etc. for the other APIs<br>		<br>		/// Contains methods and properties which directly affect the state of the gesture recognizer.<br>		///<br>		/// -Warning: Only use the state engine when implementing a custom gesture recognizer yourself.<br>		/// 		The state engine is delicate and modifying behind a gesture recognizer&#39;s back is likely to <br>		///		break it.<br>		public var stateEngine: StateEngine { return StateEngine(gestureRecognizer: self) }<br>		<br>		public struct StateEngine {<br>			private var gestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer<br>			<br>			public var state: UIGestureRecognizerState {<br>				get { return gestureRecognizer.state }<br>				nonmutating set { gestureRecognizer.state = newValue }<br>			}<br>		<br>			public func ignoreTouch(touch: UITouch, forEvent event: UIEvent) {<br>				gestureRecognizer.ignoreTouch(touch, forEvent: event)<br>			}<br>			<br>			public func reset() {<br>				gestureRecognizer.reset()<br>			}<br></p><p>			/// etc. for the other APIs<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>Now ordinary clients of UIGestureRecognizer won&#39;t see a bunch of random methods strewn around with doc comments warning not to use them; they&#39;ll see *one* property with an intimidating name and a scary comment. You could even give the property a name like `internals` to make it clearer that you shouldn&#39;t be touching this unless you know what you&#39;re doing. On the other hand, any code that needs to *can* access these features, whether or not that code happens to be located in a subclass of the class in question.<br></p><p>Obviously, this approach could benefit from formalization; there are a number of ways that might be done. For instance, you could create a sort of namespace within a class which functions the same way as the `StateEngine` struct and `stateEngine` property in the last example, but without the boilerplate:<br></p><p>	public class UIGestureRecognizer {<br>		/// Contains methods and properties which directly affect the state of the gesture recognizer.<br>		///<br>		/// -Warning: Only use the state engine when implementing a custom gesture recognizer yourself.<br>		/// 		The state engine is delicate and modifying behind a gesture recognizer&#39;s back is likely to <br>		///		break it.<br>		namespace stateEngine {<br>			// Note that `self` here is still UIGestureRecognizer.<br>			<br>			public var state: UIGestureRecognizerState {...}<br>			<br>			public func ignoreTouch(touch: UITouch, forEvent event: UIEvent) {...}<br>			public func reset() {...}<br>		}<br>		<br>		public var state: UIGestureRecognizerState {<br>			get { return stateEngine.state }<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>You could tag particular methods and properties such that files have to ask for access to that subset:<br></p><p>	public class UIGestureRecognizer {<br>		public(@restricted(set: StateEngine)) var state: UIGestureRecognizerState {...}<br>		<br>		public(@restricted(StateEngine))  func ignoreTouch(touch: UITouch, forEvent event: UIEvent) {...}<br>		public(@restricted(StateEngine)) func reset() {...}<br>	}<br></p><p>	// In some other file...<br>	import UIKit<br>	use UIGestureRecognizer.StateEngine<br></p><p>Or you could move the dangerous members into a submodule and thus require a separate import to see them. I will not speculate on a good submodule syntax, but usage would end up looking like this:<br></p><p>	import UIKit<br>	import UIKit.UIGestureRecognizerStateEngine<br></p><p>All of these approaches share the virtues of the Objective-C approach:<br></p><p>* Subclasses which don&#39;t need the dangerous stuff don&#39;t have access to it.<br>* Code which is not technically a subclass but still requires access *does* have access to it.<br>* They&#39;ll work with types which *don&#39;t* get subclassed but similarly have some rare-but-dangerous APIs.<br></p><p>So, just as with controlling override point callers, I think that `protected` is at best a rough approximation of the feature you actually want.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b3f5abbe48b7127e20fd69808c714bf?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal] Protected Access Level</strong> from <string>Charlie Monroe</string> &lt;charlie at charliemonroe.net&gt;<p>May 29, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; My answer is this: There is nothing magical about being a subclass that ought to grant access to those methods.<br></p><p>There is - it&#39;s a family member that you let use your summer house.

I come at this from the exact opposite view, I think UIGestureRecognizer shows the problem with the Obj-C solution. It’s a workaround for a painful limitation of Obj-C.

Obviously some of these are so ingrained in OO that they can&#39;t be separated; you&#39;re not going to separate inheritance of interface from inheritance of implementation. But the sharps drawer does not *have* to be part of the bundle, and there are compelling reasons to look for a different solution—one which fits this use case better, *and* simultaneously serves other use cases like non-subclassed types.<br></p><p>To give you an idea, here are a couple more potential &quot;sharps drawers&quot; in UIKit which `protected` would not serve well:<br></p><p>* View controller containment. There are very few view controllers which actually contain other view controllers; for most, these calls are a great way to mess things up. And yet some of these members, like `childViewControllers`, are definitely things you need to be able to access from outside a view controller, for instance to find a view controller to present an error message on. `protected` would expose these methods to vast amounts of code that doesn&#39;t need them, while hiding them from code that does.<br></p><p>* UIKeyInput and UITextInput methods should only be used by custom keyboards (either `inputView`s or keyboard extensions), but they&#39;re exposed to everybody, sitting right alongside methods intended for wide use. The intended clients for these APIs have no inheritance relationship whatsoever with the classes they would need to call them on, so `protected` would be of absolutely no help here.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fab081724d16d497369e46fe76f20e12?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal] Protected Access Level</strong> from <string>Charles Srstka</string> &lt;cocoadev at charlessoft.com&gt;<p>May 30, 2016 at 01:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On May 28, 2016, at 8:11 PM, Brent Royal-Gordon via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; But `protected` is quite different from other access levels; it does not limit the visibility of the symbols, but rather their use.

Many developers are tempted to<br>&gt; make this call:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; view.layoutSubviews()<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The documentation says: &quot;You should not call this method directly. If you<br>&gt; want to force a layout update, call the setNeedsLayoutmethod instead to<br>&gt; do so prior to the next drawing update. If you want to update the layout of<br>&gt; your views immediately, call the layoutIfNeeded method.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; But yes, you should call this method directly if you are subclassing the<br>&gt; view and needs to perform additional layout to its subviews (&quot;subclasses<br>&gt; can override this method as needed&quot;):<br>&gt;<br>&gt; public override func layoutSubviews() {<br>&gt;     // We are calling the super method directly here.<br>&gt;     super.layoutSubviews()<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     // Do more adjustments to this view&#39;s subviews...}<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So, yes, we can call this method directly when subclassing, but the Swift<br>&gt; compiler will not prevent you from do this when not subclassing or from any<br>&gt; other foreign class. It will not even issue a warning.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In Objective-C problems like this are usually &quot;solved&quot; my adding a kind of<br>&gt; &quot;protected&quot; header (.h) that is intended to be included only when the<br>&gt; developer is subclassing. In Swift we do not have headers, but we have the<br>&gt; new access level model. So, if the declaration of this method was...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; protected func layoutSubviews()<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ... no one outside the class or derived classes would be allowed to call<br>&gt; this method directly.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Of course, there are other cases in the Cocoa frameworks and there are<br>&gt; many other cases when we are developing software in Swift that the<br>&gt; protected access level would be very usefull.<br>&gt; Proposed solution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Create the protected access level.<br>&gt; Detailed designReference Types (classes)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; When declarated by a class the protected member will be visible to the<br>&gt; class itself and all the derived classes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // BaseClass.swiftpublic class BaseClass {<br>&gt;     public protected(set) var x = 20<br>&gt;     protected let y = 10<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     protected func doSomething() {<br>&gt;         // ...<br>&gt;     }}<br>&gt; // DerivedClass.swiftpublic class DerivedClass: BaseClass {<br>&gt;     protected override doSomething() {<br>&gt;         self.x = 10 * self.y<br>&gt;     }}<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If the member is declared as final then it will be visible but not can be<br>&gt; overrided by the derived classes. Just like it works with other access<br>&gt; levels.<br>&gt; Value Types (structs, enums, etc.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Value types cannot have derived types. In this case the protected access<br>&gt; level does not make sense and will not be allowed in their members.<br>&gt; Protocols<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Protocols do not declare access level for their members. So the protected access<br>&gt; level is not applicable here.<br>&gt; Extensions<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Extensions will not be able do be protected nor their members.<br>&gt; Special Note<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The protected access level can only be applied to classes, structs and<br>&gt; other types when nested inside other type. So the following code will not<br>&gt; compile:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // ERROR: A first level class cannot be protected.<br>&gt; protected class MyProtectedClass {<br>&gt;     /// ...}<br>&gt;<br>&gt; But nested declarations will be allowed, so this code will compile:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // We can declare a protected class (or struct, enum, etc.) if// and only if they are nested inside other type.public class MyPublicClass {<br>&gt;     protected class MyProtectedClass {<br>&gt;         /// ...<br>&gt;     }}<br>&gt; // Since `MyProtectedClass` is nested and protected we// can have access to it here.public class MyDerivedClass: MyPublicClass {<br>&gt;     public func doSomething() {<br>&gt;         let c = MyProtectedClass()<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         /// ...<br>&gt;     }}<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Impact on existing code<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The imported Cocoa frameworks may have annotations on the &quot;Objective-C<br>&gt; side&quot; that will inform if one member is protected. If this will be case<br>&gt; (for the layoutSubviews method, as example), only code accessing these<br>&gt; now protected members outside the owner class and its derived classes will<br>&gt; have to change (currently this can be considered an error, anyway).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Any other code will be not impacted by this feature as it is new to the<br>&gt; language.<br>&gt; Alternatives considered<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Do not add the protected access level to the current model.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ---<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160529/494ad820/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d02ed1b20fc3e0fa1592ce5982f24d2b?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal] Protected Access Level</strong> from <string>Leonardo Pessoa</string> &lt;me at lmpessoa.com&gt;<p>May 29, 2016 at 07:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Vanderlei, my point in bringing such topics to this discussion is to make everyone here think if we&#39;re trying to really enhance the language within its intended purpose or if we&#39;re trying to change the language into something else were familiar with from other languages we work/ed with just because we&#39;re used to work like that.

If you want to update the layout of your views immediately, call the layoutIfNeeded method.&quot;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; But yes, you should call this method directly if you are subclassing the view and needs to perform additional layout to its subviews (&quot;subclasses can override this method as needed&quot;):<br>&gt; <br>&gt; public override func layoutSubviews() {<br>&gt;     // We are calling the super method directly here.<br>&gt;     super.layoutSubviews()<br>&gt;     <br>&gt;     // Do more adjustments to this view&#39;s subviews...<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; So, yes, we can call this method directly when subclassing, but the Swift compiler will not prevent you from do this when not subclassing or from any other foreign class. It will not even issue a warning.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In Objective-C problems like this are usually &quot;solved&quot; my adding a kind of &quot;protected&quot; header (.h) that is intended to be included only when the developer is subclassing. In Swift we do not have headers, but we have the new access level model. So, if the declaration of this method was...<br>&gt; <br>&gt; protected func layoutSubviews()<br>&gt; ... no one outside the class or derived classes would be allowed to call this method directly.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Of course, there are other cases in the Cocoa frameworks and there are many other cases when we are developing software in Swift that the protected access level would be very usefull.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Proposed solution<br>&gt; Create the protected access level.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Detailed design<br>&gt; Reference Types (classes)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; When declarated by a class the protected member will be visible to the class itself and all the derived classes.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; // BaseClass.swift<br>&gt; public class BaseClass {<br>&gt;     public protected(set) var x = 20<br>&gt;     protected let y = 10<br>&gt;     <br>&gt;     protected func doSomething() {<br>&gt;         // ...<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; // DerivedClass.swift<br>&gt; public class DerivedClass: BaseClass {<br>&gt;     protected override doSomething() {<br>&gt;         self.x = 10 * self.y<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; If the member is declared as final then it will be visible but not can be overrided by the derived classes. Just like it works with other access levels.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Value Types (structs, enums, etc.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Value types cannot have derived types. In this case the protected access level does not make sense and will not be allowed in their members.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Protocols<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Protocols do not declare access level for their members.

It stems directly from the lack of scopes in the language to hide things. Over the years the language was drastically improved, but 99% of the code on github is still written like 20 years ago (minus the @synthesize). Unfortunately for swift, there is not much more choices than to have Framework = Module. A possible future improvement might be to have Framework = n-Module, but that is somehow doable if you make a multi dylib framework. The cost of creating several Swift modules inside a single framework is not light today (there would have to be one more level of section name mangling inside the dylib, something like  <br></p><p>	__xxxx__sectionA <br>	__xxxx__sectionB <br>	__xxxx__sectionC <br></p><p>	__yyyy__sectionA <br>	__yyyy__sectionB <br>	__yyyy__sectionC <br></p><p>where xxxx/yyyy are the names of the modules/namespaces sharing space inside a single dylib, compared to today&#39;s<br></p><p>	__sectionA <br>	__sectionB <br>	__sectionC <br></p><p>all things considered, it may not be that stupid… dunno it is would make lookup faster or slower if the sections were smaller.

But I am programming in Swift since the<br>&gt; first day it was publicly available (and I think that the first almost<br>&gt; usable version to create real world apps was the 1.2).

If this will be case<br>&gt;&gt; (for the layoutSubviews method, as example), only code accessing these<br>&gt;&gt; now protected members outside the owner class and its derived classes will<br>&gt;&gt; have to change (currently this can be considered an error, anyway).<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Any other code will be not impacted by this feature as it is new to the<br>&gt;&gt; language.<br>&gt;&gt; Alternatives considered<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Do not add the protected access level to the current model.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ---<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160529/bc5eeb3b/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0411520c60ef1131670f84bb42dc8949?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal] Protected Access Level</strong> from <string>Swift)</string> &lt;swift-callionica at callionica.com (Callionica&gt;<p>May 29, 2016 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Here&#39;s demo code for emulating protected in Swift:<br>https://gist.github.com/callionica/19da0763c0b0b4c504fc5f46d07e8ee8<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160529/f0b2bebc/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/831ba6eb600af4a6587f263373921bb2?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal] Protected Access Level</strong> from <string>Tino Heth</string> &lt;2th at gmx.de&gt;<p>May 30, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; <br>&gt; I can&#39;t reply directly to all the points in this thread, but I will just say that there are ways of emulating protected in the language as it exists today:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If the goal is to have functions that can be overridden by subclasses without being called by external classes, you can create a parameter of a public type with a private initializer and use it in all &quot;protected&quot; member functions.
