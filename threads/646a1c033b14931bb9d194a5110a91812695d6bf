I am also in favor for @autoclosure.<br></p><p>However, I think there is a larger issue here. In several recent attribute discussions—particularly around @autounwrapped and @discardable—options have been discarded at least partially because the attributes didn&#39;t make sense as decorations on a property or return value&#39;s type, and yet there was no way to decorate the value itself.<br></p><p>@noescape and @autoclosure *do* make sense as attributes decorating a type, and they should be changed to do that. But make no mistake: the concept of attributes on parameters and return values *is* still needed, because already today it is preventing us from adopting excellent designs.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. Unutterable types are a big problem.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>I don&#39;t think I have relevant experience.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• How much effort did you put into your review?
