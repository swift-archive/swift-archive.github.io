When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br></p><p>	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>	* How much effort did you put into your review?

If it&#39;s to support &quot;future<br>sorted collections,&quot; then the best motivating use cases would be found once<br>those have been proposed, and perhaps the &quot;customization points&quot; are best<br>bundled with them.<br></p><p>Nit: `sortedRange(of:)` could use a clearer name, maybe<br>`sortedIndexRange(of:)`, since it&#39;s indices that we&#39;re talking about.<br>Otherwise, it reads superficially like you might be getting a range of<br>*values* back.<br></p><p>        * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a<br>&gt; change to Swift?<br>&gt;<br></p><p>Yes.<br></p><p><br>&gt;         * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt;<br></p><p>Yes.<br></p><p><br>&gt;         * If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar<br>&gt; feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt;<br></p><p>The proposal itself does a nice job of comparing these facilities to C++<br>counterparts.
