I have most of it addressed, but I’m<br>&gt;&gt; not sure what you’re referring to with “If this is relating to<br>&gt;&gt; implementation details of the standard library…”? Do you mean the<br>&gt;&gt; functions I called out that need to be added?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I can remove that, but I thought it was worth calling out despite<br>&gt;&gt; the fact that they are just overloads. If it’s not necessary to do<br>&gt;&gt; so, I’ll delete that section (although there aren’t many details<br>&gt;&gt; left in the “Detailed design” at that point).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I’m referring to this part of the proposal:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &quot;Additionally the standard library has approximately a half a dozen<br>&gt; locations where optionals are compared to non-optional values which<br>&gt; will need to be updated to explicitly cast one operand to an<br>&gt; optional.”<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I’m just saying that the internal implementation details of the<br>&gt; standard library are typically considered part of an evolution<br>&gt; proposal, only the public API impact.<br></p><p>Right; it&#39;s the standard library team&#39;s job to suffer for the sake of<br>our users :-).

A<br>pull request supporting any proposal is always appreciated and makes it<br>easier to accept. <br></p><p>hint-hint-ly y&#39;rs,<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
