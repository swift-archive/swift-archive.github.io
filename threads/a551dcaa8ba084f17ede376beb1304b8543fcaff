Drop the `for case` functionality entirely; if you want that behavior, use a pattern-matching `if`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Replace the loop variable slot in the `for` statement with a pattern. This would force you to put `let` on all simple `for` statements.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Try to automatically distinguish between simple variables/tuples and patterns in this slot.

I see several ways this could be handled:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Drop the `for case` functionality entirely; if you want that behavior, use a pattern-matching `if`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Replace the loop variable slot in the `for` statement with a pattern. This would force you to put `let` on all simple `for` statements.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Try to automatically distinguish between simple variables/tuples and patterns in this slot. What could possibly go wrong?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. Require an equals sign before the `in`, like `for let foo? = in optionalFoos`. Looks a little gross, but it&#39;s unambiguous.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. Replace `for case` with `for if`, like `for if let foo? in optionalFoos`. This helps flag the unusual conditional behavior of this form of `for`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6. Just keep `for case` and don&#39;t worry about the fact that it&#39;s not parallel to the other statements anymore.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thoughts on any of this?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * `if case` also has the problem that the `=` isn&#39;t appropriate unless you happen to bind some of the data matched by the pattern, but I don&#39;t know how to address that. A prior version of this proposal suggested saying `:=` instead of `=`, with the idea that `:=` could become a general pattern-matching operator, but the people I talked over this post with hated that.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -- <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brent Royal-Gordon<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Architechies<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160203/fca1b717/attachment-0001.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85c55778d88fe0cd357b60a7a3ad81b3?s=50"></div><header><strong>Obsoleting `if let`</strong> from <string>Paul Ossenbruggen</string> &lt;possen at gmail.com&gt;<p>February  3, 2016 at 09:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>The original proposal says <br></p><p>	if let name? = optionalCondition { }<br></p><p>This would unwrap it? <br></p><p>This seems like it should be mean the opposite.

Pattern-matching conditions can still be distinguished from boolean conditions because boolean conditions can&#39;t contain an `=` operator. This, there would now only be two forms of if:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	if booleanCondition<br>&gt; 	if pattern = expression<br>&gt; <br>&gt; And the current `if let` is handled elegantly and clearly by existing pattern-matching shorthand, with only one additional character needed:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	if let name? = optionalCondition<br></p><p>This was in fact our original design for the pattern-matching-in-conditions feature. We went with the alternative &#39;if case&#39; design for a couple of reasons:<br></p><p>- As you noted, for loops are weird. `for case` makes it clearer that filtering is happening, whereas something like &#39;for x as T in sequence&#39; is more ambiguous.<br>- The way &#39;if let x = y&#39; ends up a no-op is a big pitfall<br>- Optional unwrapping is by far the most common use case for these conditions, and we got a huge amount of pushback from our users in Apple complaining about the extra syntax all over their code. &#39;if let&#39; for better or worse has also become one of Swift&#39;s trademarks.<br></p><p>I like this unification as an ivory-tower language designer, but user experience had to win out.<br></p><p>-Joe<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160203/7cca91fe/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
