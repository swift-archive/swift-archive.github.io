I mentioned that Joe has talked about making generic arguments have identical behavior to existentials.  I just realized that his comment was with respect to current existentials which don’t have associated types.  It might also be possible to extend this to existentials which bind all associated types to concrete types, but it would not apply to something like AnyCollection&lt;Foo&gt; which leaves several associated types unbound.  So as I mentioned, if we do introduce shorthand for something like AnyCollection we would need to decide whether the shorthand produces an implicit generic parameter or uses the existential.<br></p><p>I’m not sure what you mean about introducing type unsafely.
