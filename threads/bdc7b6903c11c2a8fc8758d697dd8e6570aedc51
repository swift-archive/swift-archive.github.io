This is a longstanding issue that has to do with us resolving extensions very early in compilation; there are a handful of reports on JIRA and Radar but no one&#39;s really had the chance to look into it. The issues should be inconsistent but deterministic, i.e. it would only affect some files and not others, but it won&#39;t change from affecting one file to not affecting it if there are no changes in the code.<br></p><p>The safest workaround is to define your types at the top-level and use typealiases to make them nested, and have the extensions refer to the top-level type.<br></p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience,<br>Jordan<br></p><p><br>&gt; On Jun 7, 2016, at 16:48, Victor Leong via swift-users &lt;swift-users at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hey guys, <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m starting to see problems related struct namespacing with extensions.
