If you&#39;re asking for possible alternative<br>suggestions  <br>&amp;gt; to avoid using &quot;index&quot;, I&#39;ll suggest the following here because I don&#39;t<br>recall  <br>&amp;gt; seeing them offered previously. They read as phrases or sentences:  <br>&amp;gt;  <br>&amp;gt; ```  <br>&amp;gt; // taking inspiration from ForwardIndexType, which is no more...  <br>&amp;gt; c.advancing(_ i: Index, by offset: IndexDistance, limit: Index)  <br>  <br>As I&#39;ve said before, the “ing” suffix strongly implies we&#39;re returning  <br>(a version of) `c`, not of `i`.  c.f.  <br>  <br>   Please hand me **your coat, emptying the left pocket**.  <br>  <br>You&#39;re not going to get a pocket; you&#39;re getting a whole coat.  <br></p><p>&gt;<br></p><p>&gt;  <br></p><p>&gt;<br></p><p>&gt; Quite right; didn&#39;t mean to retread that. I feel the same deficiency applies<br>to using the &quot;form&quot; convention, though, in that (at least as has been<br>discussed on this list) the convention usually refers to the receiver being<br>mutated. Thus, `c.formLocation(...)` sounds like `c` should be mutated in some<br>way.<br></p><p>&gt;<br></p><p>&gt;  <br></p><p>&gt;<br></p><p>&gt; One way out that I can think of is looking to good ol&#39; Objective-C<br>conventions. By this I mean that, in my mind, shorter method names like<br>`str.appending(...)` are derived by omitting redundant words from longer<br>ancestral names such as `str.stringByAppendingString(...)`.

Dave is organizing this feedback, and I’ll send out the<br>&gt; &gt;     formal<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; announcement when that is ready.<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; The final revisions are reflected in the latest version of the<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; proposal:<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0065-collections-move-indices.md &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0065-collections-move-indices.md&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; Summary:<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; * We decided to take Shawn Erickson&#39;s excellent suggestion<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; &lt;http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution/14450 &lt;http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution/14450&gt;&gt; to<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; use “location” uniformly for index movement, so instead of<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; successor(i) and predecessor(i) we have location(after: i) and<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; location(before: i).<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; * Since Brent Royal-Gordon pointed out<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &lt;http://news.gmane.org/find-root.php?message_id=156D8FB1%2d1FD3%2d448E%2d8C70%2d6E7400629BC0%40architechies.com &lt;http://news.gmane.org/find-root.php?message_id=156D8FB1%2d1FD3%2d448E%2d8C70%2d6E7400629BC0%40architechies.com&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; that two of the three proposed Range protocols would likely disappear<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; in future updates, we took another look at all of them. Finding<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; `RangeProtocol` itself to be a very weak abstraction, we removed all<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; three from the proposal.<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; For those interested in details, implementation work proceeds apace on<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; the swift-3-indexing-model branch at<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/swift-3-indexing-model/stdlib/public/core &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/swift-3-indexing-model/stdlib/public/core&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt;.<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; P.S. If anyone is interested in contributing, there are still plenty of<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; FIXMEs left for us to handle ;-)<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; --<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; Dave<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     --<br>&gt; &gt;     Dave<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; --<br>&gt; Dave<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160426/112d05bc/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
