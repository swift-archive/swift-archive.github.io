We&#39;re not really<br>&gt;     declaring the operation that we want to do, and that has an impact in the<br>&gt;     expressivity and readability of the code. Currently we&#39;re doing matches like<br>&gt;     &quot;if blue is the ocean&quot; instead of &quot;if the ocean is blue&quot; or &quot;if the ocean<br>&gt;     contains the whale&quot; instead of &quot;if the whale is in the ocean&quot;.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     For that reason, I would like to suggest inverting the order of the operator<br>&gt;     to match more closely our logical thought.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     case (let x, let y) where x =~ 0...4 &amp;&amp; y =~ 0...4: // Proposed<br>&gt;     // vs<br>&gt;     case (let x, let y) where 0...4 ~= x &amp;&amp; 0...4 ~= y: // Current<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     I have an ongoing proposal to suggest this change and it contains a little<br>&gt;     more context. It is available here: <br>&gt;<br>&gt;     https://github.com/dmcrodrigues/swift-evolution/blob/proposal/invert-order-of-pattern-match-operator/proposals/NNNN-invert-order-of-pattern-match-operator.md<br>&gt;    .<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     Any feedback is very welcome.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     Thank you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     David Rodrigues<br>&gt;     _______________________________________________<br>&gt;     swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;     swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;     https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/728c1be08b1a4c91add43688b40592cf?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal] Invert the order of pattern match operator</strong> from <string>David Rodrigues</string> &lt;david.ndh at gmail.com&gt;<p>April  7, 2016 at 08:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On 07 Apr 2016, at 19:16, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; It would be nice to know the rationale behind the choice of the current syntax.<br>&gt;&gt; I agree that these seem more natural:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;    @warn_unused_result<br>&gt;&gt;    public func ~=&lt;I : ForwardIndexType where I : Comparable&gt;(value: I, pattern:<br>&gt;&gt;    Range&lt;I&gt;) -&gt; Bool<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;    @warn_unused_result<br>&gt;&gt;    public func ~=&lt;I : IntervalType&gt;(value: I.Bound, pattern: I) -&gt; Bool<br>&gt; <br>&gt; +1<br></p><p>This operator was firstly introduced in Swift in the form =~ but then it was reversed to the current form (~3y ago).
