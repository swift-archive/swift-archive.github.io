There&#39;s no way for the parser to know, whether ?** is the end of an optional chaining expression<br>followed by a postfix operator ** or whether it&#39;s a single postfix operator ?**. Similarly, !** could refer to a forced-value expression followed<br>by a postfix operator ** or a single postfix operator !**.<br></p><p>Even with semantic knowledge, it is unclear, what should happen. For example, in the following situation either parsing decisions would<br>result in a valid program:<br></p><p>postfix operator ++<br>postfix operator ?++<br>postfix func ++(x: inout Int) {<br>    x += 1<br>}<br>postfix func ?++(x: Int?) -&gt; Int? {<br>    return x<br>}<br>var x: Int? = 0<br>x?++		// what should happen here? Swift 3 chooses optional chaining expression followed by ++ operator<br></p><p>I think it would probably be best to disallow postfix operators that start with a question mark or an exclamation mark.<br>At the moment it is possible to declare them, but not to use them. That&#39;s not very user-friendly. <br></p><p>By the way, infix operators have a similar problem. Infix operators that start with a ? or a ! must be surrounded by whitespace whereas<br>other infix operators don&#39;t have to be:<br></p><p>let x: Int? = 0<br>x ?? 10 	// fine<br>x??0 		// error<br>2 + 10		// fine<br>2+10		// fine<br></p><p>I think this is less of an issue, because you can at least use such infix operators if you add the necessary whitespace.<br></p><p>What do you think about this? Would it make sense to disallow postfix operators that start with a question mark or an exclamation mark?<br></p><p>Thanks and best regards,<br>Toni<br></p><p><br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20161101/de52a54f/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8aa3a9da9a32d3e98805b4a5409e4cee?s=50"></div><header><strong>Postfix operators that start with ? or !</strong> from <string>Anton Zhilin</string> &lt;antonyzhilin at gmail.com&gt;<p>November  1, 2016 at 07:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Hello Tony,<br>Feel free to file a bug report.
