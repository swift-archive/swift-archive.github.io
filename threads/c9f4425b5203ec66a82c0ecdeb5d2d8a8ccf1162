This is part of the release management process for Swift 2.2 that was documented a blog post:<br></p><p>  https://swift.org/blog/swift-2-2-release-process<br></p><p>At this point changes going into the swift-2.2-branch will require specific approval from the release manager.<br></p><p>## swift-llvm, swift-clang, swift-lldb<br></p><p>The LLVM, Clang, and LLDB repositories are taking very little change.  Please contact the respective release manager directly about taking changes into those repositories for Swift 2.2.<br></p><p>## swift<br></p><p>For the &#39;swift&#39; repository, all changes will be staged into the swift-2.2-branch using a pull request.  This is for recording review of the change as well as vetting by CI before the change is merged into swift-2.2-branch.<br></p><p>To propose a change to be pulled in, please either (a) initiate a pull request yourself or (b) contact the release manager via email if the intent is to cherry pick a small set of changes from the master branch.<br></p><p>Emails should include &quot;[Swift 2.2]&quot; in the subject line.  For larger changes, the release manager may instruct you to create a pull request directly with the template of information.<br></p><p>Unless the scope of the change is obvious, please include in the pull request the template of information (&quot;Explanation&quot;, &quot;Scope&quot;, etc) as specified in the blog post.<br></p><p>Any questions?  Please contact the respective release manager directly.<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
