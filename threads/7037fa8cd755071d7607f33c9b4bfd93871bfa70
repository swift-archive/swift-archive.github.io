I think its just matter of time before Objective-C developer get used to it.<br></p><p>&gt; I found using&amp;quot;true/false&amp;quot; Boolean values reduced the code readability from the&amp;quot;YES/NO&amp;quot; of objective-c code.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&amp;#39;m wondering if others also consider&amp;quot;yes/no&amp;quot; to be simply better.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; A few reasons:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Yes and no are much more common in every day English. Their concepts and meanings are well understood to everyone with little question.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Concepts of truthfulness and falsehood have a great deal of philosophical/moral baggage associated with them and can be very subjective. They are not used regularly in every day English. Philosophers spend ages debating what is&amp;quot;truth&amp;quot;, lawyers spend months arguing over who&amp;#39;s truth to believe and theologians are ever searching for&amp;quot;a deeper truth&amp;quot;.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; A code statement like isLightOn = yes makes perfect logical sense in English. isLightOn = true does not.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Considering proposal SE-0005 point 5 is committing to using&amp;#39;is&amp;#39; bool variable names (e.g. isLightOn) should true/false be replaced with yes/no?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I think it should.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
