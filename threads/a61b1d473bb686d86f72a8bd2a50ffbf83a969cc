Ted posted details of the Swift 3 release process last week (https://swift.org/blog/swift-3-0-release-process/ &lt;https://swift.org/blog/swift-3-0-release-process/&gt;) and I just updated the main swift-evolution README.md file (https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution&gt;) with some updated details about the goals of Swift 3.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; This release is shaping up to be a really phenomenal release that will redefine the feel of Swift and make a major leap towards maturing the Swift language and development experience.
