I think the resulting API is better in many ways. For example, on URL the main improvement is that the resource values dictionary is now struct type with a lot of strongly-typed properties. It’s still got a lot of optionals because of the way that the underlying fetch works, but it’s better.

Foundation is obviously used in tons and tons of API. We want to maintain conceptual compatibility with the entire OS X / iOS / watchOS / tvOS SDK when it is imported into Swift. Hopefully this also means that converting from reference to value types in your own uses of these API does not require a complete rethink of how you use them, but still provide the benefits outlined in the proposal.

I&#39;m<br>going to refer to NSData et. al. in the questions because that&#39;s the<br>example given in the proposal, but these questions should be more widely<br>applicable.<br></p><p>First, relating to customizing the behavior though a custom subclass to<br>NSData, I&#39;m assuming that the as operator will box the instance of the<br>NSData subclass. That is, `MyData() as Data` will create a new instance of<br>MyData, a new instance of Data, and assign the MyData instance to the Data<br>instance&#39;s _box property.<br></p><p>If that&#39;s the case, why not make it more explicit that Data is wrapping<br>MyData and instead create an initializer for Data that takes the NSData<br>instance to wrap instead of using the as operator? It definitely matches<br>the use of the as operator from NSString to String, but that design<br>decision seems to predate a preference for initializers in type conversion,<br>and I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a disadvantage to initializers or an advantage<br>to the as operator that I&#39;m not seeing.<br></p><p>Second, let&#39;s say I have a MyMutableData class in Obj-C that&#39;s a subclass<br>of NSMutableData. I have an Objective-C method that returns an instance of<br>MyMutableData, and his function is called from Swift, and I do something<br>like `let foo = objCObj.objCMethod() as Data`. The foo instance is now<br>supposed to be immutable, but backed by a mutable Objective-C object. If I<br>then mutate the data in Objective-C, what happens?<br></p><p>If the answer to this is that the MyMutableData instance is copied in the<br>transfer from Objective-C to Swift so that mutations in Objective-C don&#39;t<br>affect the Swift instance, what about the case where I used `var foo`<br>instead of `let foo`? Does that mean that if I modify the data in<br>Objective-C that it won&#39;t get modified in Swift (and vice-versa)?<br></p><p><br>On Fri, Apr 22, 2016 at 10:18 AM, Tony Parker via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Dear swift-evolution denizens,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As you know from our announcement of Swift Open Source and our work on<br>&gt; naming guidelines, one of our goals for Swift 3 is to “drop NS” for<br>&gt; Foundation.

I see this as the start<br>&gt; of the process.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; One process note: we are still trying to figure out the best way to<br>&gt; integrate changes to API that ship as part of the operating system (which<br>&gt; includes Foundation) into the swift-evolution review process.<br>&gt; Swift-evolution is normally focused on changes to functionality in the<br>&gt; compiler or standard library. In general, I don’t expect all new Foundation<br>&gt; API introduced in the Darwin/Objective-C framework to go through the open<br>&gt; source process. However, as we’ve brought up this topic here before, I felt<br>&gt; it was important to bring this particular change to the swift-evolution<br>&gt; list.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As always I welcome your feedback.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0069-swift-mutability-for-foundation.md<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Thanks,<br>&gt; - Tony<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160422/0c62df4d/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>Mutability for Foundation types in Swift</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>April 24, 2016 at 03:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; We took this feedback seriously, and I would like to share with you the start of an important journey for some of the most commonly used APIs on all of our platforms: adopting value semantics for key Foundation types.<br></p><p>This proposal is way cool, and I think you&#39;ve selected a great starting set of APIs.<br></p><p>Of the other candidate APIs you mentioned, I&#39;m definitely looking forward to AttributedString and some parts of the NSURL Loading system (primarily the requests and responses; the connections and sessions should probably be object types).

I went down this rabbit hole a few weeks ago, trying to determine if we could make an “isUniquelyReferenced” that works for Objective-C-defined classes. One obvious issue is that you can’t always trust retainCount to do the right thing for an arbitrary Objective-C class, because it may have been overridden. We can probably say “don’t do that” and get away with it, but that brings us to Tony’s point: Objective-C weak references are stored in a separate side table, so we can’t atomically determine whether an Objective-C class is uniquely referenced. On platforms that have a non-pointer “isa” we could make this work through the inline reference count (which requires changes to the Objective-C runtime and therefore wouldn’t support backward deployment), but that still doesn’t give us “isUniquelyReferenced” for Objective-C classes everywhere.<br></p><p>Interestingly, while Swift’s object layout gives us the ability to consider the weak reference count, the Swift runtime currently does not do so. IIRC, part of our reasoning was that isUniquelyReferencedNonObjC is generally there to implement copy-on-write, where weak references aren’t actually interesting. However, we weren’t comfortable enough in that logic to commit to excluding weak references from isUniquelyReferencedNonObjC “forever&quot;, and certainly aren’t comfortable enough in that reasoning to enshrine “excluding weak references” as part of the semantics of isUniquelyReference for Objective-C classes.<br></p><p>	- Doug<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160425/f7e462f0/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c69b8eb4df5af15923fd1647a8276890?s=50"></div><header><strong>Mutability for Foundation types in Swift</strong> from <string>John McCall</string> &lt;rjmccall at apple.com&gt;<p>April 25, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Apr 25, 2016, at 10:32 AM, Douglas Gregor via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; On Apr 25, 2016, at 9:20 AM, Tony Parker via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Hi Brent,<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Thanks for your feedback!

There could be an outstanding weak reference that somebody could be concurrently loading (and hence retaining), breaking the assumption in the first bullet above.  The only way to fix that is to treat weak references as making strong references non-unique, and AFAIK we have no way of detecting the non-existence of weak references on existing operating systems.  But it&#39;s not clear to me that we need to give this much weight to weak references; after all, it&#39;s equally possible to form unsafe references to existing objects, which is completely undetectable, and we&#39;ve traditionally described that as just an unsafe weak reference.<br></p><p>You have to come up with fairly contrived use cases for weak references to see problems with just ignoring them, like a memoization table that maintains both strong and weak references but drops the strong references when there&#39;s memory pressure.  In this case, our value type might end up with the last strong reference, and changing the object in-place would corrupt the cached value.  But this would be a really odd way to implement a memoization table, basically just using weak references for their own sake.<br></p><p>John.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160425/d17960f7/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/89e9af7c5754673419c8fac930319700?s=50"></div><header><strong>Mutability for Foundation types in Swift</strong> from <string>Russ Bishop</string> &lt;xenadu at gmail.com&gt;<p>April 25, 2016 at 08:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>There aren’t enough +1s in the world for this, I fully endorse your proposal and would like to subscribe to your newsletter ;)<br></p><p>Do you envision the apinotes will be the vehicle for performing the bridging since ObjectiveCBridgeable was deferred?

In order to focus on delivering something up to our quality standards, we are intentionally leaving some class types as-is until a future proposal. If you don’t see your favorite class on the list — don’t despair. We are going to iterate on this over time. I see this as the start of the process.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; One process note: we are still trying to figure out the best way to integrate changes to API that ship as part of the operating system (which includes Foundation) into the swift-evolution review process. Swift-evolution is normally focused on changes to functionality in the compiler or standard library. In general, I don’t expect all new Foundation API introduced in the Darwin/Objective-C framework to go through the open source process. However, as we’ve brought up this topic here before, I felt it was important to bring this particular change to the swift-evolution list.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; As always I welcome your feedback.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0069-swift-mutability-for-foundation.md &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0069-swift-mutability-for-foundation.md&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br>&gt;&gt; - Tony<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160425/c9638cc0/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
