This late addition to Swift 3 is a follow-up to SE-0107:<br>UnsafeRawPointer. It addresses common use cases for UnsafeRawPointer,<br>allowing developers to continue working with collections of UInt8 values,<br>but now doing so via a type safe API. The UnsafeBytes API will not require <br>direct manipulation of raw pointers or reasoning about binding memory.<br></p><p>The proposal is available here:<br></p><p>  &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0138-unsafebytes.md&gt;<br></p><p>Reviews are an important part of the Swift evolution process. All reviews<br>should be sent to the swift-evolution mailing list at<br></p><p>  &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br></p><p>or, if you would like to keep your feedback private, directly to the<br>review manager. When replying, please try to keep the proposal link at<br>the top of the message:<br></p><p>Proposal link:<br>  &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br></p><p>What goes into a review?<br></p><p>The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review<br>through constructive criticism and, eventually, determine the direction of<br>Swift. When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to<br>answer in your review:<br></p><p>  * What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>  * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a<br>    change to Swift?<br>  * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>  * If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar<br>    feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>  * How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick<br>    reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br></p><p>  &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md&gt;<br></p><p>Thank you,<br></p><p>-Dave Abrahams<br>Review Manager<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
