The linkage between date and unit/calendar is poorly motivated and arbitrary. The preconditions in `distanceTo(_:)` are scary, and converting back to a date is annoying and painful.<br></p><p>Second design: https://gist.github.com/brentdax/4272a3e01ed7037d2c5d6ba413ecf2a9<br></p><p>	let calendar = NSCalendar.currentCalendar()<br>	<br>	let now = NSDate()<br>	let tomorrow = now + calendar.interval(1, .Day)<br>	let yesterday = now - calendar.interval(1, .Day)<br>	<br>	for date in yesterday.stride(through: tomorrow, by: calendar.interval(1, .Day)) {<br>	    print(date)<br>	}<br></p><p>This could use a lot of design improvements—NSCalendar.Interval could carry an NSDateComponents, which would allow arithmetic with intervals, and the syntax could be improved with various conveniences to the point where you could write things like `days(1, in: calendar)` or just `days(1)`—but I think this is enough to get a sense of the direction.<br></p><p>Calendar intervals make more sense as a concept, and the implementation has fewer crazy preconditions—though there are still a couple—but `distanceTo` is unimplementable and there are various other ridiculous limitations. (One of them comes from Strideable indirectly requiring IntegerLiteralConvertible when it really just needs some way to construct a zero value.) Basically, you can make this work for the basics but it&#39;s not actually a good semantic match for Strideable.<br></p><p>The safety of both of these designs could benefit from dependent types, but of course we don&#39;t have those.<br></p><p>The general sense I have is that this badly needs some kind of context object, but Strideable is simply not designed that way.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d53b7c5f9b5f5557b9082face9b632a0?s=50"></div><header><strong>Feature proposal: Range operator with step</strong> from <string>Dave Abrahams</string> &lt;dabrahams at apple.com&gt;<p>March 30, 2016 at 08:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>on Tue Mar 29 2016, Joe Groff &lt;jgroff-AT-apple.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; On Mar 28, 2016, at 5:33 PM, Brent Royal-Gordon &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Floating-point seconds (as NSTimeIntervals) are the natural<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Strideable.Stride, but it&#39;s not particularly clear to me that you<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; want 1 second to be a default stride.
