Swift doesn&#39;t guarantee stable addresses for anything but top-level and static variables, so you&#39;d have to declare a &#39;var&#39; to make a valid KVO context anyway. It&#39;s not a great situation, but it&#39;s unlikely to change any time soon.<br></p><p>Jordan<br></p><p><br>&gt; On Oct 6, 2016, at 14:07, Tyler Stromberg via swift-dev &lt;swift-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hey everyone,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; One of the things that came up in a code review today was the type of KVO&#39;s context param.
