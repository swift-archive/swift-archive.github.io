Xcode is not part of the open source project. We are planning to build Swift Package Manager support into Xcode, so that might satisfy your needs here. That support is largely part of Xcode itself and not part of the open-source project, so we won&#39;t be discussing the details publicly until it&#39;s done.<br></p><p>I hope that helps,<br></p><p>	- Rick<br></p><p>&gt; On Dec 22, 2015, at 5:53 PM, ricardo duarte via swift-build-dev &lt;swift-build-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hi all,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; First off all i am quite excited to see another tool to create package manager dependencies to come to the community.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; After reading upon the existent examples i wonder if this tool will ever have the goal of allowing the generation of workspaces and to link each project automatically, not only by pointing at binaries prebuilt but at those in the derived-data, per example:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; MyWorkspace<br>&gt; |---&gt;MyApp.xcodeproj (my app depends on MyFramework1 and MyFramework2<br>&gt; |         |--&gt;MyApp (iOS Target) which is linked to configurations (preproduction/LIVE/etc)<br>&gt; |         |--&gt;MyApp (tvOS Target) which is linked to configurations (preproduction/LIVE/etc)<br>&gt; |         |--&gt;MyApp (macOS Target) which is linked to configurations (preproduction/LIVE/etc)<br>&gt; |---&gt;MyFramework1.xcodeproj<br>&gt; |         |--&gt;MyFramework1 ( iOS Target) which is linked to configurations (preproduction/LIVE/etc)<br>&gt; |         |--&gt;MyFramework1 (tvOS Target) which is linked to configurations (preproduction/LIVE/etc)<br>&gt; |         |--&gt;MyFramework1 (macOS Target) which is linked to configurations (preproduction/LIVE/etc)<br>&gt; |---&gt;MyFramework2.xcodeproj<br>&gt; |         |--&gt;MyFramework2 (Target) which is linked to configurations (preproduction/LIVE/etc)<br>&gt; |         |--&gt;MyFramework2 (tvOS Target) which is linked to configurations (preproduction/LIVE/etc)<br>&gt; |         |--&gt;MyFramework2 (macOS Target) which is linked to configurations (preproduction/LIVE/etc)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; to allow the build with different configurations within Xcode several schemes are created pointing at the same target with different preproduction/post build scripts.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; At the moment as my knowledge goes there is no such package manager within the community, and this setup is the currently the one used for our enterprise environment, I wonder if the community will ever be interested in allow such levels of customisation within the package manager itself, if other enterprise environments would benefit from it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; There is quite an interest within my company and myself to have such tool, we wonder if the same interest exists within the community? <br>&gt; If that can be if nothing like this is in roadmap is this a something that could be of use to wider population, and therefore would there be an interest create it?
