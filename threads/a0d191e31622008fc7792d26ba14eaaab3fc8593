Couldn&#39;t we return an `Element?` containing the old value if there is one, or `nil` if there&#39;s a new value?<br></p><p>* If an `insert` might collide with several elements, shouldn&#39;t we return a set of all the colliding elements, instead of `nil`? (This would do away with the exception for `OptionSetType.insert`.)<br></p><p>* Whatever `insert` does, shouldn&#39;t `update(with:)` do the same thing? Particularly with regards to updating multiple elements?<br></p><p>* How far does this &quot;don&#39;t throw away information that&#39;s hard to recalculate&quot; principle go? Should the mutating operations like `formUnion` return some indication of the affected elements? Should the *nonmutating* ones?<br></p><p>* If we&#39;re going to officially support equal-but-distinct elements in the SetAlgebra API, shouldn&#39;t we have an equivalent to NSSet&#39;s `member(_:)` method?<br></p><p>We can try to work out these and other issues in this thread, but unless there are straightforward answers, I think the better move might be to sever the return value change and discuss it separately. It brings up a lot of subtle questions across the entire API.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. These APIs need to be renamed.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. It solves an important issue with the guidelines.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>This API is superior to NSSet/NSMutableSet and Ruby&#39;s Set, which are the two set APIs I&#39;m most familiar with.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• How much effort did you put into your review?

However, I mentioned this during the review of the API naming guidelines. Using the English language to construct function names that distinguish between functional and imperative forms of the operation places constraints on API designers that produce undesirable results. The operations on an algebraic set is merely one example. My preference is a symbol appended to the function name (e.g., the exclamation point in Ruby). However, it was pointed out at the time that introducing this syntax was out-of-scope for Swift 3. What does this mean? We&#39;ll revisit this later and have to endure the rigor of another API renaming exercise?<br></p><p>Without rehashing the utility of a symbol to distinguish between functional and imperative, what is my preference?<br></p><p>Pseudo-verbs? I don&#39;t know if this is any better.<br></p><p>A suffix, such as &quot;InPlace&quot;, has some appeal for two reasons:<br></p><p>1) It is descriptive and doesn&#39;t obfuscate the meaning of the operation.<br></p><p>2) If at sometime later the community sees a practical need to introduce syntax to distinguish between functional and imperative forms of an operation, removing such a suffix and replacing it with the symbol will mitigate confusion of another renaming transition.<br></p><p>Cheers,<br>-Patrick<br></p><p>&gt; On Apr 2, 2016, at 5:15 PM, Brent Royal-Gordon &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; For example, changing union() to formUnion() for the sake of aligning compliance to API name guidelines simply doesn&#39;t make sense to me.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Given the need for separate names for the functional and imperative forms of this operation, what sorts of names would be better?

There&#39;s basically two dictionary<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; definitions of &quot;form&quot;:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. &quot;bring together parts or combine to create (something)&quot; which to me<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; implies a new value is created, and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. &quot;make or fashion into a certain shape or form&quot; which would imply that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; the material you start with is transformed, which is apparently the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; intended meaning and also the reverse meaning from the above.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I mean, doesn&#39;t this make sense as an API?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         let donut = baker.formDonut(dough) // non-mutating<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps instead of &quot;form&quot; we could use &quot;become&quot; as a prefix when the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; operation is naturally described by a noun.
