These types can be folded into Range and ClosedRange when Swift acquires conditional conformance capability.<br></p><p><br>Does this mean that once we have conditional conformances, HalfOpenRangeProtocol and ClosedRangeProtocol will most likely go away?<br></p><p>&gt; We also introduce three new protocols:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	• RangeProtocol<br>&gt; 	• HalfOpenRangeProtocol<br>&gt; 	• ClosedRangeProtocol<br>&gt; <br>&gt; These protocols mostly exist facilitate implementation-sharing among the range types, and would seldom need to be implemented outside the standard library.<br></p><p><br>If these types are for implementation sharing, should they be underscored to discourage their use? Or is the position they occupy in the type hierarchy important because Range and ClosedRange will eventually occupy them?<br></p><p>It seems to me that RangeProtocol is unlike the other two in that it&#39;s a sensible thing to constrain a parameter to. Does the &quot;implementation-sharing&quot; comment not really apply to it? On the other hand, it&#39;s not like the SubSequence subscript now takes a RangeProtocol. Should it?<br></p><p>(Has any thought been given to allowing you to close protocols to outside conformances the way that resilience seems to suggest we&#39;ll eventually allow you to close classes?)<br></p><p>&gt; • Two for general ranges (whose bounds are Comparable): Range&lt;T&gt; and ClosedRange&lt;T&gt;. Having a separate ClosedRange type allows us to address the vexing inability of the old Range to represent a range containing the maximal value of its bound.<br></p><p>I notice that ClosedRange uses a ClosedRangeIndex to, essentially, add one extra value for &quot;larger than all values of this type&quot;. Could this solution be applied to Range to allow us to unify Range and ClosedRange, or are there other obstacles to that?<br></p><p>(There likely are. I just wanted to make sure the idea wasn&#39;t left unexplored.)<br></p><p>&gt; func successor(of i: Index) -&gt; Index<br></p><p><br>Two things:<br></p><p>1. I would really like a version of this which returns Optional and is guaranteed to go `nil` once it hits `endIndex`. There can be a non-optional version too, or it might even be a feature of the `index` family of methods instead of `successor` itself, but I think it would be valuable to let the collection worry about the bounds check. It seems silly to check the index before calling `successor(of:)` when `successor(of:)` is going to immediately perform the same check again as a precondition.<br></p><p>(Actually, in general, I&#39;m a little bit dismayed that the collection API does so little to help you include bounds checks in your code. Especially when iterating through a collection, bounds checks are absolutely mandatory, and the collection API&#39;s solution to the problem is &quot;eh, just use `&lt;`, it&#39;s not like you might mess something like that up&quot;.)<br></p><p>2. There is a very strong parallel between this method and a generator&#39;s `next()` method—the generator&#39;s `next()` calls `successor(of:)` to get the index it should use—which makes me wonder if this method should also be called `next(_:)` instead of `successor(of:)`. On the other hand, I have no good suggestion for a <br></p><p>&gt; func index(n: IndexDistance, stepsFrom i: Index) -&gt; Index<br></p><p><br>Oof, I am really not a fan of this name. `steps` is sort-of a label on the `n` parameter, but it&#39;s attached to `i`. Other collection APIs use `distance`, not `steps` (although &quot;steps&quot; does appear in the documentation of the `Distance` associated type). `index` puts it in a method family with `index(predicate:)` and `index(of:)`, but those two are user-facing while this one is part of the collection API. Even the word `index` itself is redundant with the method return type.<br></p><p>I do understand how this is kind of parallel to `index(of:)` and `index(predicate:)`, in that they all return an index calculated from the parameters, but I think these methods are more different than they are similar.<br></p><p>Compared to this:<br></p><p>	collection.index(5, stepsFrom: i)<br></p><p>I would prefer any of these (ordered from least favorite to most):<br></p><p>	collection.index(distance: 5, from: i)<br>	collection.index(5, from: i)<br>	collection.traveling(5, from: i)<br>	collection.striding(5, from: i)<br>	collection.advancing(i, by: 5)<br></p><p>A word on `striding(_:from:)` appearing in that list: Although redesigning Strideable is not directly in scope for this proposal, I&#39;ve noticed that our discussions on modernizing Strideable seem to be trending towards the idea that it operates on collections (or rather, on an as-yet-unnamed supertype of `BidirectionalCollection` or `RandomAccessCollection`) and strides by repeatedly calling a method with the same semantics as this one. Thus, there seems to be an intimate connection between this operation and Strideable. I think we ought to choose a method name which suits that, and I don&#39;t think `index` is it.<br></p><p>&gt; func index(n: IndexDistance, stepsFrom i: Index, limitedBy limit: Index) -&gt; Index<br></p><p><br>I have a few issues with this API.<br></p><p>1. As aforementioned, I&#39;m not a big fan of using `index` as the base method name.<br></p><p>2. This method can move the index either forwards or backwards, but only one limit is specified. Would we be better off having the `limit` be a range?<br></p><p>3. What is the use case for returning the `limit` instead of returning the fact that we crossed it? I have a hard time thinking of a case where I would want to just bump up against the limit and use it rather than *detect* that I&#39;ve hit the limit (which would probably call for a return type of `Index?`). Are there common needs that I&#39;m just not thinking of? Should we offer both?<br></p><p>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>Despite my criticisms, this is fundamentally a very good design. It will not only improve the language, it will also open the door to further improvements.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. I believe this change is complicating in the short run but actually simplifying in the long run, eliminating concepts like the Index protocols which represented several overlapping semantics.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>Nothing with a collection design as rich as Swift&#39;s.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>Somewhere between the latter two. I wouldn&#39;t call it in-depth when it&#39;s such a big change, but I feel like I have too much background to say it&#39;s a quick reading, either.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/566528c7f7c28c35c0c646d415943612?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0065 A New Model for Collections and Indices</strong> from <string>Taras Zakharko</string> &lt;taras.zakharko at uzh.ch&gt;<p>April 11, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>+1. I think it makes the collection model more simple and more flexible at the same time. By coupling index to a specific collection, rather then treating it as a separate, independent entity, we can more easily implement alternative collections. For instance, I have recently needed a collection that wraps around the end of a sequence, e.g. <br></p><p>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].[wrappingFrom: 3, end: 2] == [4, 5, 1, 2]<br></p><p>With the current model, implementing indexes that do this kind of wrapping is quite messy, because a lot of collection-specific state needs to be stored within the index. With the new model, it becomes much simpler. <br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>I think so. The model where index has its own, independent properties is too rigid. It might be possible to work around the limitations of that model with using more advanced generics(e.g. where type information depends on values such as dimensionality etc.), but the proposed new model is much simpler and potentially allows better performing code. <br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes<br></p><p>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review?

Specifically, I don’t think the fallback to ‘form’ is required. It would be a significant readability improvement to use a meaningful verb to describe the action of altering the argument. The methods that create new indices probably need a label on the first argument, because otherwise it looks as if the IndexDistance is what is described by ‘index’.<br></p><p>Proposed:<br></p><p>  func successor(of i: Index) -&gt; Index<br>  func formSuccessor(i: inout Index)<br></p><p>Instead, I suggest:<br></p><p>  func successor(of i : Index) -&gt; Index<br>  func advance(i: inout Index)<br></p><p>Proposed:<br></p><p>  func index(n: IndexDistance, stepsFrom i: Index) -&gt; Index<br>  func index(n: IndexDistance, stepsFrom i: Index, limitedBy limit: Index) -&gt; Index<br>  func formIndex(n: IndexDistance, stepsFrom i: inout Index)<br>  func formIndex(n: IndexDistance, stepsFrom i: inout Index, limitedBy limit: Index)<br></p><p>Suggested (taking into account Nate’s suggestion of reversing the order):<br></p><p>  func index(startingAt i: Index, movedBy n: IndexDistance) -&gt; Index<br>  func index(startingAt i: Index, movedBy n: IndexDistance, limitedBy limit: Index) -&gt; Index<br>  func move(i : inout Index, by n: IndexDistance)<br>  func move(i : inout Index, by n: IndexDistance, limitedBy limit: Index)<br></p><p>Proposed:<br></p><p>  func predecessor(of i: Index) -&gt; Index<br>  func formPredecessor(i: inout Index)<br></p><p>Suggested:<br></p><p>  func predecessor(of i: Index) -&gt; Index<br>  func reverse(i: inout Index)<br></p><p><br>I think reversing an index has some nice symmetry with reversing a sequence, but if it seems to confusing, then replace advance and reverse with ‘moveForward’ and ‘moveBackward’.<br></p><p>- Tony<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt; 	* If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review?

It’s “un-Swifty” in at least two ways:<br></p><p># 1: Relatively Unsafe, Pointer-Like Semantics<br></p><p>Indices—unsurprisingly!—behave quite a bit like pointers, and similarly expose *numerous* crashing combinations of `(value,operation)`:<br></p><p>- self[endIndex]<br>- self[startIndex] // &lt;- when empty<br>- successor(of: endIndex)<br>- predecessor(of: startIndex)<br></p><p>…etc., which is *very much* reminiscent of the hazards of pointers. (Technically “undefined” not “crashing”, but being realistic “crashing&quot; is usually accurate).<br></p><p>Although Swift uses `Optional` to mitigate the hazards of `nil` pointers (etc.), you’re still left to your own devices for handling indices.<br></p><p>This isn’t news to anyone here, I’m sure, and may even be unavoidable; I’m just pointing it out as an uncharacteristically-unsafe area in Swift’s standard APIs, and closer to how `!` and IOUs behave than otherwise typical.<br></p><p>To help illustrate the claim, here’s a strawman “safe” API—for illustration only, not advocacy!—that would be safer and thus perhaps more “Swift-y”:<br></p><p>  protocol SafeCollection {<br></p><p>    /// `Index` by another name<br>    associatedtype Position: Equatable // , Comparable too if you want<br>  <br>    /// Returns `nil` when empty. A non-strawman version<br>    /// would return something better than a labeled tuple, here.<br>    var bounds: (first: Position, last: Position)? { get }<br>  <br>    /// Returns the first position, or `nil` when empty. <br>    /// Like `startIndex` but any non-nil value is safe to subscript.<br>    var firstPosition: Position? { get }<br></p><p>    /// Returns the last position, or `nil` when empty. <br>    /// Like `endIndex` but any non-nil value is safe to subscript.<br>    var lastPosition: Position? { get }<br>  <br>    /// No risk of trying to subscript `endIndex` here.<br>    subscript(position: Position) -&gt; Element<br>  <br>    /// Safe to call on any non-nil position from this collection;<br>    /// no risk of trying to advance the `endIndex` here.<br>    func successor(of p: Position) -&gt; Position?<br></p><p>    /// Safe to call on any non-nil position from this collection;<br>    /// no risk of trying to retreat-from the `startIndex` here.<br>    func predecessor(of p: Position) -&gt; Position?<br></p><p>    // and so on and so forth<br></p><p>  }<br></p><p>…which, again, I include for purpose of *comparison* only. I *believe* this illustration has more of the “index-safety” Brent is getting at, but I can’t speak for him.<br></p><p>Pros:<br>- safer, b/c there’s no `nil`-analog like `endIndex` that needs checking-for<br>- feels more Swift-like (safer, harder to mis-use)<br></p><p>Cons:<br>- likely less-efficient than current proposal<br>- wants you to use closed index ranges, not half-open<br>- doesn’t address index-invalidation (discussed immediately below)<br></p><p>So, again, I’m not advocating that “safer” design be Swift&#39;s basic building-block, but I think it illustrates why it’s fair to call the index system relatively “unsafe”: as proposed, indices have semantics that are lower-level than they seem, with a safety profile *closer to* IOU/`!` than most of Swift’s standard library. <br></p><p># 2: Index Invalidation Unrepresented In Type System <br></p><p>A related “un-Swift-y” aspect is that index-invalidation has no type-level representation whatsoever. Some operations on collections invalidate indices, but which operations? Which indices?<br></p><p>I don’t have a proposed *solution* I feel good about as to how to represent invalidation in the type system, but even so “values that become invalid for further use due to actions that happen elsewhere” is not very Swift-y.<br></p><p># Remarks<br></p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I still like this proposal, and am *very* skeptical that something like the “safer index” sketched above would be a net win; I just think it’s very fair to say that indices are a corner of the standard library that isn’t all that Swifty due to the lack of statically-enforced safety as per usual in the rest of the library.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>This is a tricky question in this context b/c pretty much every non-toy language with a non-toy standard library will have its own take on collections-and-iteration; it also makes it very hard to be concise, as the same terms mean slightly different things from language to language.<br></p><p>I think it’s fair to say that although *many* languages have something analogous to Swift’s `Generator` (soon: `Iterator`), *very few* languages have based their fundamental collections hierarchy/API around Swift-style indices.<br></p><p>Additionally, most languages I’m familiar with have a hierarchy that, in Swift terms, would look something like this:<br></p><p>- Sequence<br>  - Collection<br>    - ArrayCollection // or `ForwardCollection` in Swift, probably<br>    - DictionaryCollection // or AssociativeCollection, or MapCollection, etc.<br>    - SetCollection <br></p><p>…as opposed to Swift’s design (wherein `Collection` *is* essentially the nonexistent `ForwardCollection`, and all collections are thus `ForwardCollection`s).<br></p><p>I’m not sure Swift gains much from being this way; put differently, if Swift currently looked like this:<br></p><p>  protocol CloningIterator : Iterator {<br></p><p>    /// Returns a copy of `self` (at the current iteration state).<br>    func clone() -&gt; Self<br></p><p>  }<br></p><p>  protocol Collection : Sequence {<br>    // no `Index` here<br>    associatedtype Iterator: CloningIterator<br>    <br>    // minimal API here<br>    var isEmpty: Bool { get }<br>    var count: Int { get }<br>  }<br></p><p>  protocol ForwardCollection : Collection {<br> <br>    // exactly as-per proposal’s `Collection`:<br>    associatedtype Index <br>     <br>    // all Index-related methods exactly as-per proposal’s `Collection`<br></p><p>  }<br></p><p>  struct Array&lt;T&gt; : ForwardCollection {}<br>  struct Set&lt;T&gt; : Collection {}<br>  struct Dictionary&lt;K,V&gt; : Collection {}<br></p><p>…then I’d still want `ForwardCollection` to have an API like the proposal (wherein collections-move-indices), but I’d personally see no real value gained by “promoting&quot; `Set` and `Dictionary` to be `ForwardCollection`.<br></p><p>But, I’ve made that case before.<br></p><p>I want to reiterate that I think this proposal is more-or-less the best possible design for what it is—collections *should* move indices, when they have them!<br></p><p>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>I’ve groused unproductively about aspects of iteration-and-collection design in numerous previous discussions; I’ve written some custom collections and some collection-combinators and in so doing encountered many issues with the previous design.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thank you,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Chris Lattner<br>&gt; Review Manager<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160412/c80ca658/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d4fb9162c777a5d6d0b1fb00893d709?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0065 A New Model for Collections and Indices</strong> from <string>Haravikk</string> &lt;swift-evolution at haravikk.me&gt;<p>April 13, 2016 at 12:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>I’m a +1 for the proposal (but as I’ve implemented a bunch of collections recently I’m not sure I’m looking forward to having to update my code to reflect the new pattern ;)<br></p><p>But I’m interested by these concerns:<br></p><p>&gt; On 12 Apr 2016, at 17:57, plx via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; # 1: Relatively Unsafe, Pointer-Like Semantics<br>&gt; # 2: Index Invalidation Unrepresented In Type System <br></p><p>It seems to me as though we could solve #1 by solving #2 actually; if we knew when indices were invalid, then unless we’re storing .endIndex or using .startIndex or .endIndex on an empty collection (rather than .first and .last) then there should no issues of the safety of these “pointers&quot; anymore.<br></p><p>The tricky thing is how to handle #2; we can do this at run-time by having indices include a reference to their parent (or some kind of ID class), plus a copy of a state variable which the collection will use to track invalidating changes.

However I<br>have a number of reservations, particularly:<br></p><p><br>   1. The motivation of improved performance smacks of &quot;premature<br>   optimisation&quot;. For particularly high performance collections a fast unsafe<br>   form could be provided, like UnsafePointer, e.g. UnsafeArray. For the rest<br>   I think it is better to have a clean API rather than skew the API for<br>   performance.<br>   2. The proposed iterator, `collection.next(&amp;iterator)`, is not as<br>   convenient to use as a classic external or internal iterator. It introduces<br>   the potential for errors where an iterator from one collection is used in<br>   another and where the collection and iterator are manipulated separately.<br>   What&#39;s the point of eliminating C for loops because of index problems and<br>   then introducing much the same? The new iterator cannot be type erased<br>   without also capturing the associated collection, defeating the point of<br>   the new iterators!<br>   3. The protocols are quite hierarchical; instead they could be a<br>   collection [sic] of small, top-level protocols that are plugged together. A<br>   useful division is one main method per protocol with &#39;good&#39;, default<br>   implementations provided for other methods. A &#39;good&#39; implementation of<br>   count would not be iterating through the collection counting!<br>   4. The members, e.g. map, filter, return specific implementations like<br>   Array. I find this restrictive. Would it be possible to return a protocol<br>   to allow other implementations more flexibility.<br>   5. There is an advantage in splitting lazy into a separate hierarchy,<br>   there is precedence for this in that both Java, Stream, and C#, LINQ, do<br>   this. The main differences are that you would expect a collection to be<br>   multiple iterable, e.g. inside a nested loop, and mutable, e.g.<br>   subscriptable, whereas a lazy can only be guaranteed to be iterable once<br>   and is purely functional. This splitting of lazy into a separate API would<br>   also lay the groundwork for a parallel-lazy version.<br>   6. The naming of the protocols would be better if they were Xxxable and<br>   that xxx referred to the main method in the protocol. For example instead<br>   of Sequence, Iterable because its key feature is iterate.<br>   7. I think Range would be better if it has an Int index of 0 to count -<br>   1 and a value of start + index * stride, where start and stride are of type<br>   Arithmetic, i.e. range[index] = start + index * stride.<br></p><p><br>* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to<br>Swift?<br></p><p>Yes the current collections API could be improved and it is an important<br>part of any programming language.<br></p><p>* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>In some ways yes, it captures more of your intention in the type system.<br>But in other ways no, it introduces an iterative paradigm that is<br>potentially more error prone that the existing one and step back towards<br>using subscripts and index for everything, ie. C for loop style.<br></p><p>* If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar feature,<br>how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>Obviously everyone uses collection API&#39;s in every language. I have used<br>collections in many diverse languages and also written custom collections,<br>e.g. a parallel collection API in Java before Java got a standard version.<br></p><p>* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading,<br>or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>Quite a bit, including fleshing out a minimal collection API that conforms<br>to the principles stated above and posted on swift-evolution under the new<br>iterator model discussions.<br></p><p>  -- Howard.<br></p><p>On 11 April 2016 at 07:41, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The review of &quot;A New Model for Collections and Indices&quot; begins now and<br>&gt; runs through April 18th.
