I propose that all three of the following scenarios share this nature:<br>At call sites with variadic arguments<br>At call sites with defaulted arguments<br>At definition sites with large complex argument lists or tuple members<br>It&#39;s slightly easier to make the case for call sites, the first two of these uses, as they exactly mirror the way collections parse members. Supporting the third style of trailing commas requires the consideration of real world modern Swift. <br></p><p>Allowing cut and paste or commenting of entire parameter lines means simple changes do not ripple out to affect other lines. In this, trailing commas serve programmer intent and limit the effect in diff comparisons. As Joe pointed out in one of his responses on this thread, one edit becomes one diff, without extra housekeeping for other affected lines. When considered together, I do believe the use cases for these scenarios are common enough to be considered something other than a &quot;special case&quot;. <br></p><p>Given that SE-0060 is accepted, the third case is narrowed but should not be ignored. Reordering and commenting out lines during prototyping, working in playgrounds, and scripting is still common. Also, a reorder or comment when trailing commas are permitted ensures that such changes are single-point edits. <br></p><p>As Brent points out in his review, &quot;I was skeptical of this until a week or two ago, when I had some code where I ended up commenting out certain parameters.&quot; Trailing commas, although a minor feature in a major language, still serves the developer and supports the overall philosophy of Swift, which is as you have pointed out multiple times, an opinionated language.<br></p><p>-- E<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160512/29eb9422/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/697f00e1b9be900f24cd1669cc931874?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0084: Allow trailing commas in parameter lists and tuples</strong> from <string>L.

Parameter lists also have labels, and (depending on how the ‘disable reordering default arguments’ decision goes) parameters may not be added and reordered arbitrarily.  Tuples are different because adding a member will often break all the code downstream because it changes the type of the value.  This is different than array and dictionary literals.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The only “collection like” aspect I can think of is for variadic parameter lists, but I don’t think they’re common enough to provide a special case for.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I agree that the trailing comma offers its best support for situations that express variadic properties. I propose that all three of the following scenarios share this nature:<br>&gt; At call sites with variadic arguments<br>&gt; At call sites with defaulted arguments<br>&gt; At definition sites with large complex argument lists or tuple members<br>&gt; It&#39;s slightly easier to make the case for call sites, the first two of these uses, as they exactly mirror the way collections parse members. Supporting the third style of trailing commas requires the consideration of real world modern Swift. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Allowing cut and paste or commenting of entire parameter lines means simple changes do not ripple out to affect other lines. In this, trailing commas serve programmer intent and limit the effect in diff comparisons. As Joe pointed out in one of his responses on this thread, one edit becomes one diff, without extra housekeeping for other affected lines. When considered together, I do believe the use cases for these scenarios are common enough to be considered something other than a &quot;special case&quot;. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Given that SE-0060 is accepted, the third case is narrowed but should not be ignored. Reordering and commenting out lines during prototyping, working in playgrounds, and scripting is still common. Also, a reorder or comment when trailing commas are permitted ensures that such changes are single-point edits. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; As Brent points out in his review, &quot;I was skeptical of this until a week or two ago, when I had some code where I ended up commenting out certain parameters.&quot; Trailing commas, although a minor feature in a major language, still serves the developer and supports the overall philosophy of Swift, which is as you have pointed out multiple times, an opinionated language.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- E<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160512/047f83ca/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed9a0d8cd44b62539b141f6c10405db1?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0084: Allow trailing commas in parameter lists and tuples</strong> from <string>Rob Napier</string> &lt;robnapier at gmail.com&gt;<p>May 10, 2016 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Tue, May 10, 2016 at 2:53 PM, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;<br>&gt;         * What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt;<br></p><p>Trailing commas is clearly very useful in the collections case.

We should be consistent in either accepting or rejecting trailing commas everywhere we have comma-delimited syntax. I&#39;m in favor of accepting it, since it&#39;s popular in languages where it&#39;s supported to enable a minimal-diff style, so that changes to code don&#39;t impact neighboring lines for purely syntactic reasons. If you add an argument to a function, without trailing comma support, a comma has to be added to dirty the previous line:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	--- a.swift<br>&gt; 	+++ a.swift<br>&gt; 	 foo(<br>&gt; 	   x: 0,<br>&gt; 	-  y: 1<br>&gt; 	+  y: 1,<br>&gt; 	+  z: 2<br>&gt; 	 )<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Trailing commas avoid this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	--- a.swift<br>&gt; 	+++ a.swift<br>&gt; 	 foo(<br>&gt; 	   x: 0,<br>&gt; 	   y: 1,<br>&gt; 	+  z: 2,<br>&gt; 	 )<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; In languages that don&#39;t support trailing commas, many users resort to the abomination of leading-comma style, strangely popular in Haskell and related languages:<br></p><p>I am not sure I understand where the “abomination” lies in using leading-comma style… but I will try to see it.<br></p><p>&gt; 	<br>&gt; 	--- a.swift<br>&gt; 	+++ a.swift<br>&gt; 	 foo( x: 0<br>&gt; 	    , y: 1<br>&gt; 	+   , z: 2<br>&gt; 	    )<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I think the trailing-comma syntax jives much better with Swift style.<br></p><p><br>If commas are to be construed as elegantly but meaninglessly dropped little crumbs, then one can see why it might not matter where they go, or how many there are, which as well as begging the question of allowing them at the end, should equally prompt the question of completely removing them altogether.

If you add an argument to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; a function, without trailing comma support, a comma has to be added to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; dirty the previous line:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; --- a.swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; +++ a.swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo(<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   x: 0,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -  y: 1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; +  y: 1,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; +  z: 2<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; )<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Trailing commas avoid this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; --- a.swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; +++ a.swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo(<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   x: 0,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   y: 1,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; +  z: 2,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; )<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; In languages that don&#39;t support trailing commas, many users resort to the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; abomination of leading-comma style, strangely popular in Haskell and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; related languages:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I am not sure I understand where the “abomination” lies in using<br>&gt;&gt; leading-comma style… but I will try to see it.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; --- a.swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; +++ a.swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo( x: 0<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    , y: 1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; +   , z: 2<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    )<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the trailing-comma syntax jives much better with Swift style.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; If commas are to be construed as elegantly but meaninglessly dropped little<br>&gt;&gt; crumbs, then one can see why it might not matter where they go, or how many<br>&gt;&gt; there are, which as well as begging the question of allowing them at the<br>&gt;&gt; end, should equally prompt the question of completely removing them<br>&gt;&gt; altogether. And if having extras is just /great anticipation on future<br>&gt;&gt; needs/, should we think about considering the following lines as all equivalent<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; let v0 = (1,<br>&gt;&gt;          2,<br>&gt;&gt;          3)<br>&gt;&gt; let v1 = (1,<br>&gt;&gt;          2,<br>&gt;&gt;          3,<br>&gt;&gt;         )<br>&gt;&gt; let v2 = (,        // just in case I want to add something at the front later?!<br>&gt;&gt;          1,<br>&gt;&gt;          2,<br>&gt;&gt;          3,)<br>&gt;&gt; let v3 = (1,<br>&gt;&gt;          2,<br>&gt;&gt;          ,<br>&gt;&gt;          3,<br>&gt;&gt;         )         // just in case I want to add something in the middle or<br>&gt;&gt; front later<br>&gt;&gt; let v4 = (1,,<br>&gt;&gt;          2,,<br>&gt;&gt;          3,,)   // lets be really good programmer, in case it doubles in<br>&gt;&gt; length<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Aside from the good-anticipation interpretation of trailing commas, there<br>&gt;&gt; is also the /thinking-interuptus/  line of interpretation:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; this and<br>&gt;&gt; that and<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; standing for: now hold your breath, I am not done.. or maybe I lost my<br>&gt;&gt; train of thoughts so I am actually done… who knows.. read the next line to<br>&gt;&gt; figure that out.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; As I recall there is an ongoing debate about long string literal… Perhaps<br>&gt;&gt; this line of thinking can help there too?!!  Swift would become very unique<br>&gt;&gt; and progressive with something like:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; let var = this is a long string literal”  // notice my continuation quote<br>&gt;&gt; at the end<br>&gt;&gt;     which I am continuing to the”        // notice how I am letting people<br>&gt;&gt; know that, like my parameter list,<br>&gt;&gt;     next line and perhaps even”          // my string may not be quite<br>&gt;&gt; finished yet<br>&gt;&gt;     to the next one and even”  // …<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Like in the convenient case of a trailing comma in a parameter list, I<br>&gt;&gt; added a last quote character so that I can add another string later,<br>&gt;&gt; without having to resort to the /cliche/ notion of a leading quote. and<br>&gt;&gt; like with trailing commas, it is just a placeholder because my string is<br>&gt;&gt; really finished for now!<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Another convenient area where this reasoning could potentially be applied<br>&gt;&gt; might be logical expressions!!! The ability to anticipate on future needs<br>&gt;&gt; to change a logical expression might also be neat there by allowing<br>&gt;&gt; expressions like:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; if (cond1 &amp;&amp;<br>&gt;&gt;      cond2 &amp;&amp;) {<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; which floats a lot than the overly tight:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; if (cond1<br>&gt;&gt;      &amp;&amp; cond2) {<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I think I’m convinced… it is such a powerful concept it should probably<br>&gt;&gt; extend to the english language at large and<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Cheers<br>&gt;&gt; LM/<br>&gt;&gt; [just in case, I hope everyone has seen the tongue-in-cheeks tone ;-) ]<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; PS: can they actually be removed EVERYWHERE instead?!<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -Joe<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0084: Allow trailing commas in parameter lists and tuples</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>May 12, 2016 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On May 11, 2016, at 9:47 AM, Joe Groff &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; +1 from me.

Commas are already redundant syntax to provide additional clarity over spaces in nearly all use cases. Being strict on this provides no material benefit.
