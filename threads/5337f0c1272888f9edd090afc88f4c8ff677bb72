I think it would be nice to allow the application of variadic args from an array. The syntax I could think of is:<br></p><p>let args = [&quot;World&quot;]<br>printf(&quot;Hello %s&quot;, *args)<br></p><p>So, &quot;*&quot; just converts &quot;[a,b,c]&quot; into &quot;a,b,c&quot;, that&#39;s the idea. What do you think? (I don&#39;t suggest that this should also be used for dynamically dispatching overloaded methods, but if it would work, I would not complain ;) .) Syntactically, it is no breaking change, and could also be introduced after Swift 3 has been released. From the perspective of the ABI, I don&#39;t know.<br></p><p>Regarding the removal of varargs:<br>No way, -100 from me. Just because you don&#39;t like a feature, doesn&#39;t mean it should be banned. I, for example don&#39;t like certain { curly brace } styles, but that doesn&#39;t mean that I would be happy if the only curly brace style that the language allows would be my style. Maybe my tastes change in a year or two. And for things like `sprintf`, I think variadic args are really helpful. In Objective-C, I use them for example for logging, having a function signature like NSString&#39;s stringWithFormat:. In that case, having to put a @[ bracket ] around all log arguments would be bad. And writing LogMe(@&quot;it&#39;s done.&quot;, @[]) looks weird too!<br></p><p>-Michael<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
