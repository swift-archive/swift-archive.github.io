Cross-referencing between the two will be invaluable, and we&#39;ll likely invest some effort on our side to having some tooling to help bridge at least from JIRA issues to Radar so we can keep more of the core issue tracking in JIRA.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160102/add7adae/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
