The delta from that to stored properties<br>&gt; as default implementations in protocols isn’t that large, and if it’s a<br>&gt; better modeling of the problems abstract classes are meant to solve, that’s<br>&gt; the right thing to do. Other than stored properties, what important problems<br>&gt; do abstract classes solve that protocols don’t?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; There is precedence for this approach, in Scala and Java you can have their<br>&gt; equivalents of calculated properties in protocols but not stored properties.<br>&gt; Both Scala and Java have abstract classes and this seems to work well.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Numerous languages have abstract classes; the question is whether they are<br>&gt; the right answer in Swift.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - Doug<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Monday, 11 January 2016, Douglas Gregor via swift-evolution<br>&gt; &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; On Jan 10, 2016, at 6:43 PM, Wallacy via swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt; &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; TL;DR<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Thinking about some problems presented here this mailing list.

Let’s step<br>&gt;&gt; back to a simpler problem: stored properties in (non-protocol) extensions.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; In the existing language, one can only introduce stored properties in the<br>&gt;&gt; primary definition of the type. That’s because, when we create an instance<br>&gt;&gt; of that type, we need to know how much storage to allocate for that<br>&gt;&gt; instance. So, right now, we don’t even allow, e.g.,<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; struct MyStruct { }<br>&gt;&gt; extension MyStruct { var storage: Int = 0 } // error: extensions may not<br>&gt;&gt; contain stored properties<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; class MyClass { }<br>&gt;&gt; extension MyClass { var storage: Int = 0 } // error: extensions may not<br>&gt;&gt; contain stored properties<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; because, in the worst case, we don’t know about the storage required for<br>&gt;&gt; the “storage” property until after we’ve allocated some instances of<br>&gt;&gt; MyStruct or MyClass, and we can’t simply go back and resize those instances<br>&gt;&gt; when we learn about the “storage” property. The “worst case” here could come<br>&gt;&gt; about with shared libraries: put the MyStruct/MyClass primary definitions<br>&gt;&gt; into an app, then put the extensions into a separate shared library. The app<br>&gt;&gt; creates some MyStruct and MyClass instances, then loads the shared library,<br>&gt;&gt; and now we have a problem: those instances have no storage for “storage.”<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; We could relax the requirement to allow extensions in the same module as<br>&gt;&gt; the primary definition of that type to introduce stored properties, because<br>&gt;&gt; they’re compiled along with the primary type definition anyway.
