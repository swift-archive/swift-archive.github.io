Special behavior tied to properties is one of the largest sources of boilerplate in Swift, and allowing that boilerplate to be factored out is an extremely welcome step. Ever since the discussions about behaviors first started, I&#39;ve been keeping an eye out for places I would use them if they were available, and I&#39;ve spotted many such cases in my code.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. Eventually, this proposal should allow us to rework many ad-hoc features of Swift properties into standard library features. This approach is very, very Swifty.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>I&#39;ve used metaprogramming in Ruby and Objective-C to do broadly similar factoring in a different way, by generating accessors at runtime based on pseudo-declarative code. The behaviors approach is less flexible, because it has to be extended for each capability we want to add, but it&#39;s also *far* easier to use correctly.<br></p><p>I also have experience with the Perl 6 approach (I haven&#39;t actually used the final Perl 6, but I was active in its design process, and actually wrote a proof-of-concept CMS for Pugs as a Summer of Code project). Perl 6 does this quite differently; essentially, it makes the variable an object of its own, separate from the value stored in it, and allows you to apply roles (traits/mixins) to the variable in order to customize its behavior. This is a very, very powerful approach, but it would most likely introduce more overhead than is appropriate for Swift, which aspires to be a systems language.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>I participated quite heavily in the preliminary discussions and submitted detailed critiques at that time; it&#39;s probably safe to say that I have not suggested any changes because my suggestions have already been discussed and incorporated where appropriate.

Property behaviors provide a well-founded mechanism to replace several existing special cases in the language. The new mechanism is orthogonal to existing language features, so it actually simplifies the language versus having special cases. As a general tool, it will help developers to eliminate substantial boilerplate in a principled way.<br></p><p># Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Mostly certainly!

OTOH, this would be giving users access to the “#” namespace, which means that future conflicts would have to be resolved with backticks - e.g. if they wanted a “line” behavior, they’d have to use &quot;var #`line` foo = 1738”. I guess the fact that we already have a solution to the imagined problem means that this isn’t a big concern in practice.<br></p><p>In any case, I think we should just pick a syntax, land the feature, and keep bikeshedding on it through the end of Swift 3 :-)<br></p><p><br></p><p>What are the semantics of behaviors applied to var/let decls with non-trivial patterns?  For example:<br></p><p>	var [lazy] (foo, bar) = qux()<br></p><p>?  While we could devise semantics for this in some cases, I think it is reasonable to only allow behaviors on single-identifier patterns, and reject the other cases as invalid.  If you agree, please loop that into the proposal.<br></p><p><br></p><p>I understand the need to specifying whether the getter/setter and other random methods are mutating or not, but doesn’t this eliminate the difference between a var/let behavior?  Couldn’t we just say that a behavior with a nonmutating getter &amp; setter are valid on a “let”, and that any other mutating members are unavailable on a let?  This seems like a theoretical win, though I’m not sure whether it would actually be a win in practice for any conceivable behaviors you’ve been thinking about.<br></p><p><br></p><p>I like the approach of having a behavior decl, but am not excited about the decl syntax itself:<br>behavior var [lazy] _: Value = initialValue {<br></p><p>I understand that this is intended to provide a template-like construct, but I have a few problems with this:<br></p><p>1) A number of the things here are actually totally invariant (e.g. the _, the colon) or only serve to provide a name (Value, initialValue) but cannot be expanded into general expressions, though they look like they are.<br></p><p>2) This is totally unprecedented in Swift.  We have a very regular structure of “@attributes decl-modifiers introducer_keyword name” - we have no declarations that look like this.  For example, while operator decls could follow this structure, they don’t.<br></p><p>3) If you agree that we don’t need to differentiate between var/let then “behavior var&quot; is providing potentially misleading info.<br></p><p>IMO, the most regular decl structure would be:<br></p><p>@initial_value_required      // or something like it.<br>property behavior lazy {      // could be “subscript behavior” at some point in the future?<br>   var value: Self? = nil        // Self is the property type?  Seems weird if it is the enclosing type.<br>   ...<br>}<br></p><p>or perhaps:<br></p><p>@initial_value_required<br>property behavior lazy&lt;PropertyType&gt; {  // specify the type of the property as a generic constraint?<br>   var value: PropertyType? = nil   <br>   ...<br>}<br></p><p>though I agree that this would require us to take “behavior” as a keyword.  Do we know whether or not this would be a problem in practice?  If so, going with “behavior var” and “behavior let” is probably ok.<br></p><p><br>Of course, @initial_value_required is also pretty gross.  The alternative is to follow the precedent of operator decls, and introduce random syntax in their body, such as:<br></p><p>property behavior lazy&lt;PropertyType&gt; {<br>   initializer initValue<br>   var value: PropertyType? = nil   <br>   …<br>       value = initValue<br>   ...<br>}<br></p><p><br></p><p><br>  // Behaviors can declare storage that backs the property.<br>  private var value: Value?<br></p><p>What is the full range of access control allowed here?  Is there any reason to allow anything other than “public” (which would mean that the entity is exposed at whatever the properties access control level is)?  If so, why allow specifying internal?  For sake of exposition in the proposal, it seems simplest to say:<br></p><p>var value: Value?  // private by default<br></p><p>or something.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br>  // Behaviors can declare initialization logic for the storage.<br>  // (Stored properties can also be initialized in-line.)<br>  init() {<br>    value = nil<br>  }<br></p><p>If a behavior has an init() with no arguments, then are the semantics that it is *always* run?  What if there are both an init() and an init(value : Value)?<br></p><p><br> // Inline initializers are also supported, so `var value: Value? = nil`<br>  // would work equivalently.<br></p><p>This example is using a stored property of type Optional&lt;Value&gt; which has a default value of nil, does that count or is this a syntactic requirement?  To me, it seems most natural to follow the existing rules we have:<br></p><p>1) If you write any init, then you get what you write.<br>2) If there are no init’s, and any stored property in a behavior is non-default initializable, then it is an error.<br>3) If there are no init’s, and all stored properties in a behavior are default initializable, then you get init() implicitly.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Typographical comment:<br>    if let value = value {<br>      return value<br>    }<br></p><p>You have way too many “value”s floating around, for sake of clarity, how about:<br></p><p>    if let valuePresent = value {<br>      return valuePresent<br>    }<br></p><p><br>In &quot;Resettable properties”, you have this:<br></p><p>  // Reset the property to its original initialized value.<br>  mutating func reset() {<br>    value = initialValue<br>  }<br></p><p>This raises the question of how “initialValue” works:  Is it evaluated once when the property is bound and the resultant value is stored somewhere (evaluating any side effects exactly once) or is it an auto-closure-like concept?

Chris and other already provided comments on a number of points that also came to my mind. Specifically, I am not very keen on the proposed v.[foo] syntax and also the declaration of behaviours looks off to me as well (even though its elegant in its own right). I’d prefer something like<br></p><p>property behavior foo&lt;valueType: Value, instanceType: Self where …&gt; {<br></p><p>}<br></p><p>e.g. where we take the already available generics syntax and extend it with arguments to signal that behaviours are generics over multiple specific dimensions (this can be also used for a future extension of generic types). Required initial value can be coded by a presence of a constructor that takes mandatory argument, for example, or by an attribute as Chris suggests.<br></p><p>One potential problem with a feature like this is that it is very fundamental —it affects many areas of the language, some of those in a non-trivial way. These things are hard to get from the first go. I’d suggest that one makes an experimental implementation first and lets a bunch of people test-drive it for a couple of weeks or even months. I am sure that there will be some subtle design decisions that one might regret later. <br></p><p>So yes, its a definitive +1 but of the kind “revise and resubmit”. Also, sole real-world testing should be done before feature like this is be accepted into the core language. I also believe that fundamental, non-trivial features like these are best designed in a team. <br></p><p>&gt; Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>Yes. it makes the language more consistent and flexible, while removing idiosyncrazy. I am also sure that it will open up new possibilities for the UI framework teams to come up with great APIs :)<br></p><p>&gt; Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>Yes, definitely <br></p><p>&gt; If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>I have used Python that has a very similar feature (property descriptors) quite extensively, and I have implemented many different patterns using this mechanism (such as property observing and binding). I have also implemented something similar for R.  I believe that Joe’s proposal is much better thought out and fits the overall theme of a strongly typed language very well. <br></p><p>&gt; How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>A quick reading. I was also following the discussion, but its a bit difficult to keep up — watching the swift-evolution list is more like a full-time job :)<br></p><p>— Taras<br></p><p>&gt; On 11 Feb 2016, at 07:13, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Feb 10, 2016, at 2:00 PM, Douglas Gregor via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; Proposal link:<br>&gt;&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0030-property-behavior-decls.md &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0030-property-behavior-decls.md&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution#what-goes-into-a-review-1&gt;What goes into a review?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review through constructive criticism and, eventually, determine the direction of Swift.

Chris and other already provided comments on a number of<br>&gt; points that also came to my mind. Specifically, I am not very keen on the<br>&gt; proposed v.[foo] syntax and also the declaration of behaviours looks off to<br>&gt; me as well (even though its elegant in its own right). I’d prefer something<br>&gt; like<br>&gt;<br>&gt; property behavior foo&lt;valueType: Value, instanceType: Self where …&gt; {<br>&gt;<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; e.g. where we take the already available generics syntax and extend it<br>&gt; with arguments to signal that behaviours are generics over multiple<br>&gt; specific dimensions (this can be also used for a future extension of<br>&gt; generic types). Required initial value can be coded by a presence of a<br>&gt; constructor that takes mandatory argument, for example, or by an attribute<br>&gt; as Chris suggests.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; One potential problem with a feature like this is that it is very<br>&gt; fundamental —it affects many areas of the language, some of those in a<br>&gt; non-trivial way. These things are hard to get from the first go. I’d<br>&gt; suggest that one makes an experimental implementation first and lets a<br>&gt; bunch of people test-drive it for a couple of weeks or even months. I am<br>&gt; sure that there will be some subtle design decisions that one might regret<br>&gt; later.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So yes, its a definitive +1 but of the kind “revise and resubmit”. Also,<br>&gt; sole real-world testing should be done before feature like this is be<br>&gt; accepted into the core language. I also believe that fundamental,<br>&gt; non-trivial features like these are best designed in a team.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a<br>&gt;    change to Swift?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes. it makes the language more consistent and flexible, while removing<br>&gt; idiosyncrazy. I am also sure that it will open up new possibilities for the<br>&gt; UI framework teams to come up with great APIs :)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes, definitely<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar<br>&gt;    feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I have used Python that has a very similar feature (property descriptors)<br>&gt; quite extensively, and I have implemented many different patterns using<br>&gt; this mechanism (such as property observing and binding). I have also<br>&gt; implemented something similar for R.  I believe that Joe’s proposal is much<br>&gt; better thought out and fits the overall theme of a strongly typed language<br>&gt; very well.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - How much effort did you put into your review?

When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to<br>&gt; answer in your review:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I’m +1 on the feature.  I have some comments for discussion though, I’m<br>&gt; sorry I didn’t get these to you before the formal proposal went out:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; First, on the most obvious bikeshed, the surface level syntax proposed:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; var [lazy] foo = 1738<br>&gt; foo.[lazy].clear()<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Given the recent trend to use # for compiler synthesized / macroish /<br>&gt; magic syntax, it is worth considering whether:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; var #lazy foo = 1738<br>&gt; foo.#lazy.clear()<br>&gt;<br>&gt; might make sense, or even:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;  #lazy var foo = 1738<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I think that something like this is a bit better aesthetically, since the<br>&gt; [] delimiters are heavily array/collection/subscript-centric (which is a<br>&gt; good thing).  OTOH, this would be giving users access to the “#” namespace,<br>&gt; which means that future conflicts would have to be resolved with backticks<br>&gt; - e.g. if they wanted a “line” behavior, they’d have to use &quot;var #`line`<br>&gt; foo = 1738”. I guess the fact that we already have a solution to the<br>&gt; imagined problem means that this isn’t a big concern in practice.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In any case, I think we should just pick a syntax, land the feature, and<br>&gt; keep bikeshedding on it through the end of Swift 3 :-)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What are the semantics of behaviors applied to var/let decls with<br>&gt; non-trivial patterns?  For example:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; var [lazy] (foo, bar) = qux()<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ?  While we could devise semantics for this in some cases, I think it is<br>&gt; reasonable to only allow behaviors on single-identifier patterns, and<br>&gt; reject the other cases as invalid.  If you agree, please loop that into the<br>&gt; proposal.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I understand the need to specifying whether the getter/setter and other<br>&gt; random methods are mutating or not, but doesn’t this eliminate the<br>&gt; difference between a var/let behavior?  Couldn’t we just say that a<br>&gt; behavior with a nonmutating getter &amp; setter are valid on a “let”, and that<br>&gt; any other mutating members are unavailable on a let?  This seems like a<br>&gt; theoretical win, though I’m not sure whether it would actually be a win in<br>&gt; practice for any conceivable behaviors you’ve been thinking about.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I like the approach of having a behavior decl, but am not excited about<br>&gt; the decl syntax itself:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; behavior var [lazy] _: Value = initialValue {<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I understand that this is intended to provide a template-like construct,<br>&gt; but I have a few problems with this:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 1) A number of the things here are actually totally invariant (e.g. the _,<br>&gt; the colon) or only serve to provide a name (Value, initialValue) but cannot<br>&gt; be expanded into general expressions, though they look like they are.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 2) This is totally unprecedented in Swift.  We have a very regular<br>&gt; structure of “@attributes decl-modifiers introducer_keyword name” - we have<br>&gt; no declarations that look like this.  For example, while operator decls<br>&gt; could follow this structure, they don’t.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 3) If you agree that we don’t need to differentiate between var/let then<br>&gt; “behavior var&quot; is providing potentially misleading info.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; IMO, the most regular decl structure would be:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; @initial_value_required      // or something like it.<br>&gt; property behavior lazy {      // could be “subscript behavior” at some<br>&gt; point in the future?<br>&gt;    var value: Self? = nil        // Self is the property type?  Seems<br>&gt; weird if it is the enclosing type.<br>&gt;    ...<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; or perhaps:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; @initial_value_required<br>&gt; property behavior lazy&lt;PropertyType&gt; {  // specify the type of the<br>&gt; property as a generic constraint?<br>&gt;    var value: PropertyType? = nil<br>&gt;    ...<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; though I agree that this would require us to take “behavior” as a<br>&gt; keyword.  Do we know whether or not this would be a problem in practice?<br>&gt; If so, going with “behavior var” and “behavior let” is probably ok.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Of course, @initial_value_required is also pretty gross.  The alternative<br>&gt; is to follow the precedent of operator decls, and introduce random syntax<br>&gt; in their body, such as:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; property behavior lazy&lt;PropertyType&gt; {<br>&gt;    initializer initValue<br>&gt;    var value: PropertyType? = nil<br>&gt;    …<br>&gt;        value = initValue<br>&gt;    ...<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   // Behaviors can declare storage that backs the property.<br>&gt;   private var value: Value?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What is the full range of access control allowed here?  Is there any<br>&gt; reason to allow anything other than “public” (which would mean that the<br>&gt; entity is exposed at whatever the properties access control level is)?  If<br>&gt; so, why allow specifying internal?  For sake of exposition in the proposal,<br>&gt; it seems simplest to say:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; var value: Value?  // private by default<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; or something.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   // Behaviors can declare initialization logic for the storage.<br>&gt;   // (Stored properties can also be initialized in-line.)<br>&gt;   init() {<br>&gt;     value = nil<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If a behavior has an init() with no arguments, then are the semantics that<br>&gt; it is *always* run?  What if there are both an init() and an init(value :<br>&gt; Value)?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;  // Inline initializers are also supported, so `var value: Value? = nil`<br>&gt;   // would work equivalently.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This example is using a stored property of type Optional&lt;Value&gt; which has<br>&gt; a default value of nil, does that count or is this a syntactic<br>&gt; requirement?  To me, it seems most natural to follow the existing rules we<br>&gt; have:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 1) If you write any init, then you get what you write.<br>&gt; 2) If there are no init’s, and any stored property in a behavior is<br>&gt; non-default initializable, then it is an error.<br>&gt; 3) If there are no init’s, and all stored properties in a behavior are<br>&gt; default initializable, then you get init() implicitly.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Typographical comment:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     if let value = value {<br>&gt;       return value<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You have way too many “value”s floating around, for sake of clarity, how<br>&gt; about:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     if let valuePresent = value {<br>&gt;       return valuePresent<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In &quot;Resettable properties”, you have this:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   // Reset the property to its original initialized value.<br>&gt;   mutating func reset() {<br>&gt;     value = initialValue<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This raises the question of how “initialValue” works:  Is it evaluated<br>&gt; once when the property is bound and the resultant value is stored somewhere<br>&gt; (evaluating any side effects exactly once) or is it an auto-closure-like<br>&gt; concept?  If it is autoclosure-like, what does it mean in terms of<br>&gt; requiring “self.&quot; qualification &amp; @noescape?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In the context of your @NSCopying-replacement example, I would want<br>&gt; something like this:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;   var [copying] myproperty : NSString<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   init(a : NSString) {<br>&gt;      myproperty = a<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; to work, where the behavior requires an initial value, but that value is<br>&gt; provided by a flow-sensitive initialization point by DI .  How does this<br>&gt; happen?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &quot;This imposes an *initializer requirement* on the behavior. Any property<br>&gt; using the behavior must be declared with an initial value&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Ah, this gets to the @NSCopying replacement example.  This might be too<br>&gt; limiting, but so long as there is a path forward to generalize this, it<br>&gt; seems like a fine starting point.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; [[Coming back to this after reading to the end]] Ok, I see this is in the<br>&gt; future directions section.  I’m fine with punting this to a further<br>&gt; revision of the proposal, but I think that it is worthwhile to provide a<br>&gt; syntactic affordance to differentiate properties that “must have an<br>&gt; initializer expression” and “must be initialized by an &#39;init(v: Value)’<br>&gt; member on the behavior before otherwise used”.  @NSCopying replacement<br>&gt; seems like the later case.  I’m fine with pushing off the general case to a<br>&gt; later proposal, but we should carve out space for it to fit in.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; public behavior var [changeObserved] _: Value = initialValue {<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ...<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     if oldValue != newValue {<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This makes me vaguely uncomfortable, given that “changeObserved” has<br>&gt; undeclared type requirements that are only diagnosed when the behavior is<br>&gt; instantiated.  I’d greatly prefer to see something like:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; @initial_value_required<br>&gt; property behavior changeObserved&lt;PropertyType : Equatable&gt; {  //<br>&gt; constraint specified!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; which would allow the behavior to be modularly type checked.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; [[later…]] ah, I see that you’re doing something similar but different in<br>&gt; the &quot;Synchronized Property Access” example.  I mostly care that we can<br>&gt; express and modularly check this, the exact syntax isn’t as important.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In detailed design:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; property-behavior-decl ::=<br>&gt;   attribute* decl-modifier*<br>&gt;   &#39;behavior&#39; &#39;var&#39; &#39;[&#39; identifier &#39;]&#39; // behavior name<br>&gt;   (identifier | &#39;_&#39;)                  // property name binding<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If you go with this declaration syntax, I’d suggest requiring _ for the<br>&gt; name, since the name isn’t otherwise used for anything.  Ah, it looks like<br>&gt; you say this later, maybe the grammar just needs to be updated?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - A _ placeholder is required in the name position. (A future<br>&gt;    extension of behaviors may allow the property name to be bound as a string<br>&gt;    literal here.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &quot;Inside a behavior declaration, self is implicitly bound to the value<br>&gt; that contains the property instantiated using this behavior. For a<br>&gt; freestanding property at global or local scope, this will be the empty<br>&gt; tuple (), and for a static or class property, this will be the metatype.<br>&gt; Within the behavior declaration, the type of self is abstract and<br>&gt; represented by the implicit generic type parameter Self.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This is somewhat strange to me.  Would it be reasonable to say that self<br>&gt; is bound iff the behavior has a classbound requirement on Self?<br>&gt; Alternatively, perhaps you could somehow declare/name the declcontext type,<br>&gt; and refer to it later by a name other than Self?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   mutating func update(x: Int) {<br>&gt;     [foo].x = x // Disambiguate reference to behavior storage<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It would be really nice to be able to keep “self” referring to the<br>&gt; behavior, and require an explicit declaration for the enclosing declaration<br>&gt; if a behavior requires one (e.g. in the case of atomic).<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &quot;Nested Types in Behaviors”<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This sounds great in the fullness of time, but it seems subsettable out of<br>&gt; the first implementation/proposal.

I guess the fact that we already have a solution to the imagined problem means that this isn’t a big concern in practice.<br></p><p>Doesn&#39;t seem like an obvious analogy to me, since there&#39;s potentially a runtime component to these. As you noted, it also introduces a naming collision problem until we have a proper general solution for what &#39;#&#39; means, and I don&#39;t think we want to just shovel stuff ad-hoc into that namespace without more of a plan. We already overload &#39;[]&#39; for other things like capture lists, which isn&#39;t necessarily an excuse to overload it further, but we aren&#39;t sacrificing some pure design principle either.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; In any case, I think we should just pick a syntax, land the feature, and keep bikeshedding on it through the end of Swift 3 :-)<br></p><p>Agreed.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; What are the semantics of behaviors applied to var/let decls with non-trivial patterns?  For example:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	var [lazy] (foo, bar) = qux()<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ?  While we could devise semantics for this in some cases, I think it is reasonable to only allow behaviors on single-identifier patterns, and reject the other cases as invalid.  If you agree, please loop that into the proposal.<br></p><p>Yeah, it&#39;s impossible to do if the behavior binds the initial value expression. We could potentially support it for behaviors with DI-like initialization. I had mentioned this but accidentally cut it out while trying to simplify, thanks for the heads up.<br></p><p>&gt; I understand the need to specifying whether the getter/setter and other random methods are mutating or not, but doesn’t this eliminate the difference between a var/let behavior?  Couldn’t we just say that a behavior with a nonmutating getter &amp; setter are valid on a “let”, and that any other mutating members are unavailable on a let?  This seems like a theoretical win, though I’m not sure whether it would actually be a win in practice for any conceivable behaviors you’ve been thinking about.<br></p><p>I think we should subset &#39;let&#39; behaviors out for the same reason we don&#39;t yet allow computed &#39;let&#39; properties—right now &#39;let&#39; guarantees immutability, and we don&#39;t have a way in the language to enforce that for user code. It would definitely be nice to be able to declare &#39;let [delayed]&#39; and &#39;var [delayed]&#39;, though.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I like the approach of having a behavior decl, but am not excited about the decl syntax itself:<br>&gt; behavior var [lazy] _: Value = initialValue {<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I understand that this is intended to provide a template-like construct, but I have a few problems with this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1) A number of the things here are actually totally invariant (e.g. the _, the colon) or only serve to provide a name (Value, initialValue) but cannot be expanded into general expressions, though they look like they are.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2) This is totally unprecedented in Swift.  We have a very regular structure of “@attributes decl-modifiers introducer_keyword name” - we have no declarations that look like this.  For example, while operator decls could follow this structure, they don’t.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 3) If you agree that we don’t need to differentiate between var/let then “behavior var&quot; is providing potentially misleading info.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; IMO, the most regular decl structure would be:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; @initial_value_required      // or something like it.<br>&gt; property behavior lazy {      // could be “subscript behavior” at some point in the future?<br>&gt;    var value: Self? = nil        // Self is the property type?  Seems weird if it is the enclosing type.<br>&gt;    ...<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; or perhaps:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; @initial_value_required<br>&gt; property behavior lazy&lt;PropertyType&gt; {  // specify the type of the property as a generic constraint?<br>&gt;    var value: PropertyType? = nil   <br>&gt;    ...<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; though I agree that this would require us to take “behavior” as a keyword.  Do we know whether or not this would be a problem in practice?  If so, going with “behavior var” and “behavior let” is probably ok.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Of course, @initial_value_required is also pretty gross.  The alternative is to follow the precedent of operator decls, and introduce random syntax in their body, such as:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; property behavior lazy&lt;PropertyType&gt; {<br>&gt;    initializer initValue<br>&gt;    var value: PropertyType? = nil   <br>&gt;    …<br>&gt;        value = initValue<br>&gt;    ...<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br></p><p>Yeah, this is more like what I had proposed in previous drafts. If we go this route, I would rather use special contextual declarators like this than &#39;@initial_value_required&#39;-like attributes.<br></p><p><br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;   // Behaviors can declare storage that backs the property.<br>&gt;   private var value: Value?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What is the full range of access control allowed here?  Is there any reason to allow anything other than “public” (which would mean that the entity is exposed at whatever the properties access control level is)?  If so, why allow specifying internal?  For sake of exposition in the proposal, it seems simplest to say:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; var value: Value?  // private by default<br>&gt; <br>&gt; or something.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;   // Behaviors can declare initialization logic for the storage.<br>&gt;   // (Stored properties can also be initialized in-line.)<br>&gt;   init() {<br>&gt;     value = nil<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If a behavior has an init() with no arguments, then are the semantics that it is *always* run?  What if there are both an init() and an init(value : Value)?<br></p><p>As proposed there is no &#39;init(value: Value)&#39;; we can design that later. An &#39;init()&#39; with no arguments would always run at initialization time, as if:<br></p><p>var [behavior] x: Int<br></p><p>instantiated storage like:<br></p><p>var `x.[behavior].storage`: BehaviorStorage&lt;Int&gt; = `[behavior].init()`<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;  // Inline initializers are also supported, so `var value: Value? = nil`<br>&gt;   // would work equivalently.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This example is using a stored property of type Optional&lt;Value&gt; which has a default value of nil, does that count or is this a syntactic requirement?  To me, it seems most natural to follow the existing rules we have:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1) If you write any init, then you get what you write.<br>&gt; 2) If there are no init’s, and any stored property in a behavior is non-default initializable, then it is an error.<br>&gt; 3) If there are no init’s, and all stored properties in a behavior are default initializable, then you get init() implicitly.<br></p><p>I thought that was self-evident. I can make it explicit.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Typographical comment:<br>&gt;     if let value = value {<br>&gt;       return value<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; You have way too many “value”s floating around, for sake of clarity, how about:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     if let valuePresent = value {<br>&gt;       return valuePresent<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; In &quot;Resettable properties”, you have this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   // Reset the property to its original initialized value.<br>&gt;   mutating func reset() {<br>&gt;     value = initialValue<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This raises the question of how “initialValue” works:  Is it evaluated once when the property is bound and the resultant value is stored somewhere (evaluating any side effects exactly once) or is it an auto-closure-like concept?  If it is autoclosure-like, what does it mean in terms of requiring “self.&quot; qualification &amp; @noescape?<br></p><p>In the proposal, I say it behaves like a get-only property—it evaluates every time it&#39;s loaded.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; In the context of your @NSCopying-replacement example, I would want something like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;   var [copying] myproperty : NSString<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   init(a : NSString) {<br>&gt;      myproperty = a<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; to work, where the behavior requires an initial value, but that value is provided by a flow-sensitive initialization point by DI .  How does this happen?<br></p><p>Yeah. DI-like initialization is one of the future directions.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; &quot;This imposes an initializer requirement on the behavior. Any property using the behavior must be declared with an initial value&quot;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Ah, this gets to the @NSCopying replacement example.  This might be too limiting, but so long as there is a path forward to generalize this, it seems like a fine starting point.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; [[Coming back to this after reading to the end]] Ok, I see this is in the future directions section.  I’m fine with punting this to a further revision of the proposal, but I think that it is worthwhile to provide a syntactic affordance to differentiate properties that “must have an initializer expression” and “must be initialized by an &#39;init(v: Value)’ member on the behavior before otherwise used”.  @NSCopying replacement seems like the later case.  I’m fine with pushing off the general case to a later proposal, but we should carve out space for it to fit in.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; public behavior var [changeObserved] _: Value = initialValue {<br>&gt; ...<br>&gt;    <br>&gt;     if oldValue != newValue {<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; This makes me vaguely uncomfortable, given that “changeObserved” has undeclared type requirements that are only diagnosed when the behavior is instantiated.<br></p><p>That was an oversight. In reality you&#39;d have to declare:<br></p><p>public behavior var [changeObserved] _: Value = initialValue<br>  where Value: Equatable {<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; In detailed design:<br>&gt; property-behavior-decl ::=<br>&gt;   attribute* decl-modifier*<br>&gt;   &#39;behavior&#39; &#39;var&#39; &#39;[&#39; identifier &#39;]&#39; // behavior name<br>&gt;   (identifier | &#39;_&#39;)                  // property name binding<br>&gt; If you go with this declaration syntax, I’d suggest requiring _ for the name, since the name isn’t otherwise used for anything.  Ah, it looks like you say this later, maybe the grammar just needs to be updated?<br>&gt; A _ placeholder is required in the name position. (A future extension of behaviors may allow the property name to be bound as a string literal here.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; &quot;Inside a behavior declaration, self is implicitly bound to the value that contains the property instantiated using this behavior. For a freestanding property at global or local scope, this will be the empty tuple (), and for a static or class property, this will be the metatype. Within the behavior declaration, the type of self is abstract and represented by the implicit generic type parameter Self.&quot;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This is somewhat strange to me.  Would it be reasonable to say that self is bound iff the behavior has a classbound requirement on Self?  Alternatively, perhaps you could somehow declare/name the declcontext type, and refer to it later by a name other than Self?<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   mutating func update(x: Int) {<br>&gt;     [foo].x = x // Disambiguate reference to behavior storage<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It would be really nice to be able to keep “self” referring to the behavior, and require an explicit declaration for the enclosing declaration if a behavior requires one (e.g. in the case of atomic).<br></p><p>Sure, we could take that approach. I don&#39;t think it makes sense to constrain access to the enclosing value to classes, though.<br></p><p>&gt; &quot;Nested Types in Behaviors”<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This sounds great in the fullness of time, but it seems subsettable out of the first implementation/proposal.  Lacking this, it can be easily worked around with a private peer type.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;     // Parameter gets the name &#39;bas&#39; from the accessor requirement<br>&gt;     // by default, as with built-in accessors today.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Not really important for the v1 proposal, but it seems like a natural direction to allow this to be controlled by “API names” in the accessor.  The default would be that there are no API names, but if a behavior specified one, e.g.:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 		willSet(newValue newValue : Value)  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; then “newValue” would be the default name in the body of the accessor.  If no “API name” were specified, then no name would be default injected.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Typographical comment w.r.t. the &quot;// Reinvent computed properties” example, you refer to the behavior as both “foobar” and “computed” later, I think the later reference is supposed to be &quot;var [foobar] bar: Int”?  Feel free to find more diversity in your metasyntactic names here :-)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; &quot;Accessor requirements cannot take visibility modifiers; they are always as visible as the behavior itself.&quot;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Maybe I’m misinterpreting this, but I see accessors differently.  I see them as “never being accessible to the code that declares a property using the behavior”.  If you want this, you can define a method that wraps them or something.  To a client of a behaviors, accessors are “implementation only”.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Can property requirements in protocols have behaviors on them?<br>I think not.<br></p><p>-Joe<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160211/31fb4a73/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0030 Property Behaviors</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>February 11, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Feb 11, 2016, at 10:30 AM, Joe Groff &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; In any case, I think we should just pick a syntax, land the feature, and keep bikeshedding on it through the end of Swift 3 :-)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Agreed.<br></p><p>WFM.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I understand the need to specifying whether the getter/setter and other random methods are mutating or not, but doesn’t this eliminate the difference between a var/let behavior?

I think the `@` syntax should be reserved for compiler directives. The `[]` mechanism also could be expanded on like so:<br></p><p>```swift<br>/// abc is both lazy and atomic in behavior<br>var [lazy, atomic] abc: Int = 1234<br></p><p>/// ^ expands to:<br>var `abc.lazy` = LazyBehavior&lt;Int&gt; { 1234 }<br>var `abc.atomic`: AtomicBehavior&lt;Int&gt; { `abc.lazy` }<br>var abc: Int {<br>	get { return `abc.atomic`.get() }<br>	set(val) { `abc.atomic`.set(val) }<br>}<br>```<br></p><p>That is, in the order of appearance of the behaviors within the brackets, their behaviors will become a composed chain. Now this also means that some behaviors can only be initial or terminal, which must be specified through other syntactical means. In addition:<br></p><p>```swift<br>/// abc has behavior `myBehavior` which requires a parameter<br>var [myBehavior(parameter: true)] abc: Int = 1234<br>```<br></p><p>Again, this also further increases complexity, and possibly the need for a separate `behavior` declaration, instead of piggybacking on `protocol` (it could possibly be similar to `operator` syntax?).<br></p><p>--<br>Aditya Vaidyam<br></p><p>Purdue University<br>College of Science ‘17<br>Neurobiology and Physiology, Computer Science, Pre-medicine<br></p><p>&gt; On Feb 14, 2016, at 3:36 PM, Brent Royal-Gordon via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I’m sorry if this has already been discussed, but what are the drawbacks of putting the variable&#39;s behaviors before the ‘var’ keyword?

Like this:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; lazy synchronized var x:SomeType<br>&gt; <br>&gt; With no prefix at all, this limits our ability to introduce declaration modifiers in the future. For instance, if the people clamoring for a `local` access modifier win in Swift 4, anyone who wrote a behavior called `local` will be very sad.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The other problem is, with this declaration:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	lazy var array = [1, 2, 3]<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It offers no way to disambiguate between the two meanings of `lazy`:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	array.lazy.reset()<br>&gt; 	array.lazy.map { ... }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Personally, if we&#39;re not going to use the `[]` syntax, I think we should use the `@` prefix and think of all uses of `@` throughout the language as eventual targets for behavior-ization (even if we don&#39;t get around to most of them in Swift 3, or some of them ever).

When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to<br>&gt; answer in your review:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Would it be out-of-scope to propose extending this to functions?  I can<br>think of several use-cases:<br></p><p>1.) Providing both static &amp; singleton accessors, for the convenience of<br>users of your library.  In a library I&#39;ve been writing, I&#39;ve found that all<br>my configuration calls take this form:<br></p><p>public static func useCoreData() -&gt; Self { return<br>sharedInstance().useCoreData() }<br>public func useCoreData() { /* Code here; */ return self }<br></p><p>public static func useNotifications() -&gt; Self { return<br>sharedInstance().useNotifications() }<br>public func useNotifications() { /* Code here; */ return self }<br></p><p>I&#39;d love to be able to do (using the ... syntax for the proposed splat<br>operator being discussed in another thread):<br></p><p>public behavior func [StaticChainable] name(...ArgumentType) -&gt; ResultType {<br>  public static func name(...args) -&gt; Self { return<br>sharedInstance().name(...args) }<br>  public func name() { body; return self }<br>}<br></p><p>public func [StaticChainable] useCoreData() { /* Code here */ }<br>public func [StaticChainable] useNotifications() { /* Code here */ }<br></p><p>2.) Providing both &quot;whole&quot; and &quot;parts&quot; versions of Composite Pattern<br>methods.  Very often, you might have a tree structure where each element<br>has the same type (or conforms to the same protocol).  You want a method<br>with an optional first arg to specify which element you&#39;re operating on:<br></p><p>public func move(toElement: DOMElement, edge: EdgeType) { /* Code here */ }<br>public func move(childWithID id: String, toElement elem: DOMElement, edge:<br>EdgeType {<br>  children[id].move(toElement: elem, edge: edge)<br>}<br></p><p>public func hide() { /* Code here */ }<br>public func hide(childWithID id: String) { children[id].hide() }<br></p><p>public func show() { /* Code here */}<br>public func show(childWithID id: String) { children[id].show() }<br></p><p>vs.<br></p><p>public behavior func [Composite] name(...ArgumentType) -&gt; ResultType where<br>Self: HasChildren {<br>  public func name(...args) { body }<br>  public func name(childWithID id: String, ...args) {<br>self.children[id].name(...args) }<br>}<br></p><p>public func [Composite] move(toElement: DOMElement, edge: EdgeType) { /*<br>Code here */ }<br>public func [Composite] show() { /* Code here */ }<br>public func [Composite] hide() { /* Code here */ }<br></p><p>3.) Or you have a number of convenience functions that differ only in what<br>helpers they invoke:<br></p><p>public func remove(elementAtIndex i: Index) { /* Code here */ }<br>public func remove(element: Generator.Element) { remove(elementAtIndex:<br>indexOf(element)) }<br>public func remove(firstMatchingPredicate pred: Generator.Element throws -&gt;<br>Bool) {<br>   remove(elementAtIndex: indexOf(pred))<br>}<br></p><p>public func insertAfter(elementAtIndex i: Index, newElement:<br>Generator.Element) { /* Code here */ }<br>public func insertAfter(element: Generator.Element, newElement:<br>Generator.Element) {<br>   remove(elementAtIndex: indexOf(element))<br>}<br>public func insertAfter(firstMatchingPredicate pred: Generator.Element<br>throws -&gt; Bool, newElement: Generator.Element) {<br>   remove(elementAtIndex: indexOf(pred))<br>}<br></p><p>public func insertBefore(elementAtIndex i: Index, newElement:<br>Generator.Element) { /* Code here */ }<br>public func insertBefore(element: Generator.Element, newElement:<br>Generator.Element) {<br>   remove(elementAtIndex: indexOf(element))<br>}<br>public func insertBefore(firstMatchingPredicate pred: Generator.Element<br>throws -&gt; Bool, newElement: Generator.Element) {<br>   remove(elementAtIndex: indexOf(pred))<br>}<br></p><p>4.) Sometimes you need to define a combination of functions and related<br>properties, like in the Builder Pattern.  (Note the usage of &quot;return self&quot;<br>here - that&#39;s why this is not done with straight settable properties, it&#39;s<br>so the user can chain set calls together and avoid repeating the object<br>name):<br></p><p>private var foo : String<br>public func setFoo(newValue: String) -&gt; Self { foo = newValue; return self }<br></p><p>private var bar : String<br>public func setBar(newValue: String) -&gt; Self { bar = newValue; return self }<br></p><p>private var baz : String<br>public func setBaz(newValue: String) -&gt; Self { baz = newValue; return self }<br></p><p>(Also this is a good opportunity to use the &quot;set once&quot; behavior mentioned<br>in the proposal, but I won&#39;t repeat that code here.)<br></p><p>public behavior var [Builder] name: Type = initialValue {<br>  private var name: Type = initialValue<br>  public func set##name(newValue: Type) -&gt; Self { name = newValue; return<br>self }<br>}<br></p><p>public var [Builder] foo: String<br>public var [Builder] bar: String<br>public var [Builder] baz: String<br></p><p>Notice that this is a &quot;var&quot; behavior rather than a &quot;func&quot; behavior...I&#39;d<br>envision the keyword matching the type of entity you *decorate*, not the<br>type of entity generated.  The declarations are public because the access<br>modifier of the declaration should set a *maximum* visibility, not a<br>minimum (i.e. you can always make individual instances of a behavior more<br>restrictive).  ## is a token-pasting operation similar to the C<br>preprocessor; it lets you construct a new name out of identifiers.  I&#39;d<br>assume it would do automatic capitalization of the second argument to<br>preserve camelCasing.<br></p><p>5.) Sometimes you need a whole suite of classes, functions, and variables.<br>For example, think of event handlers:<br></p><p>public behavior class [Event] name {<br>  public class name##Event : Event {<br>    body<br></p><p>    func preventDefault() { ... }<br>  }<br></p><p>  public protocol name##Listener {<br>    public func on##name(event: name##Event)<br>  }<br></p><p>  private var listeners = [name##Listener]()<br>  public func add##name##Listener(listener: name##Listener) {<br>    listeners.append(listener)<br>  }<br>  public func remove##name##Listener(listener: name##Listener) {<br>    listeners.remove(atIndex: listeners.indexOf(listener))<br>  }<br></p><p>  func fire##name##Event(event: name##Event) {<br>    for listener in listeners {<br>      listener(event)<br>    }<br>  }<br>}<br></p><p>class [Event] Click {<br>  let windowCoordinates: Point<br>  let viewCoordinates: Point<br>}<br></p><p>class [Event] TouchDown {<br>  struct Touch {<br>    let coordinates: Point<br>    let force: Double<br>  }<br>  let touches: [Touch]<br>}<br></p><p><br>The way I&#39;d envision this extension working is that the &quot;behavior&quot; keyword<br>could be followed by any top-level entity: let/var, func, class, struct,<br>enum.  The behavior then forms a template for entities to be generated and<br>expanded in place.  &#39;name&#39; is bound to the name of the entity, &#39;body&#39; to<br>the statement body from the grammar.  Functions can define individual<br>arguments, types, and a result type, or can use whatever the outcome of the<br>splatting discussion is as &quot;all remaining arguments, taken from the<br>instantiating func declaration.&quot;  Classes can also bind the supertype and<br>associated types.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to be able to reach into<br>the body and parse it for individual statements; at least, none of the<br>use-cases I thought of require this.<br></p><p>All the scoping &amp; storage concerns are as per the original proposal.  Code<br>within the body is not allowed to access code inside the behavior (beyond -<br>possibly? - calling public member functions or properties that are defined<br>by the behavior).  When generating names from behavior expansion, the<br>compiler checks for name conflicts with any other symbols.  Code within the<br>behavior is not allowed to inspect or destructure the body beyond the<br>bindings already described, but may call other methods either within the<br>behavior or within the hosting class if the class conforms to a protocol<br>(as per the existing proposal).  (Perhaps some form of limited<br>destructuring could be allowed as a generalization of accessor<br>requirements; allow binding names to functions with the &#39;func&#39; keyword in<br>classes, binding to variables with &#39;let&#39; in function bodies, etc.  Haven&#39;t<br>really thought this through, may end up being too complicated.)<br></p><p>A couple features of the existing proposal can be removed under this<br>generalization.  The syntax for calling a method of a property isn&#39;t<br>necessary; instead of x.[lazy].clear, define &quot;func clear##name&quot; inside the<br>behavior and call it as clearX().  (This also eliminates the need to have<br>debates over what that syntax should be. :-))  It also lifts the<br>restriction on &#39;let&#39; parameters, as these are just another top-level entity<br>that could be expanded to a set of other entities.  They wouldn&#39;t allow<br>accessors or get/set blocks, however; the purpose of this would not be to<br>allow computed &#39;let&#39; properties, it would be to fold in additional<br>functionality into these declarations.  One could imagine libraries that<br>allow clients to auto-delegate all method calls in a protocol to a<br>sub-object, for example:<br></p><p>public behavior let [DelegateCNContactPicker] name: Type = initialValue<br>      where Type: CNContactPickerDelegate, Self: CNContactPickerDelegate,  {<br>  public func contactPickerDidCancel(...args) {<br>name.contactPickerDidCancel(...args) }<br>  public func contactPicker(...args) { name.contactPicker(...args)<br>  // Should it include overloads implicitly with ...args?  Or should each<br>be overridden explicitly?<br>}<br></p><p>and then its use:<br></p><p>class MyViewController: CNContactPickerDelegate {<br>  private let [DelegateCNContactPicker] myObjectThatReallyHandlesIt =<br>MyContactPickerDelegate()<br>  // No forwarding methods needed, and no need to expose<br>myObjectThatReallyHandlesIt to the outside world.<br>}<br></p><p>I think this mechanism may also be able to subsume default methods on<br>protocols - instead of using an extension, you could use a behavior with a<br>protocol constraint.  I haven&#39;t really thought through the implications of<br>this, though, in particular the possibility of protocols with storage.  May<br>not be possible, in which case we wouldn&#39;t want to allow behaviors on<br>protocols.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a<br>&gt;    change to Swift?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes.  There are a number of use-cases here, and it generalizes several<br>special-case features that are currently baked into the compiler.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I think so, but I&#39;ll let people with a better sense of the feel and<br>direction of Swift make that decision.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar<br>&gt;    feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It reminds me a lot of Lisp macros, and in particular the ability to<br>define many entities at once or intercept the definition of those entities<br>(used to good effect in CLOS).  This is one of the best features of Lisp;<br>it lets you eliminate much of the boilerplate that shows up in<br>production-quality libraries for Java, C#, C++, etc.<br></p><p>Behaviors let you side-step many of the hygiene/gensym issues of Lisp<br>because they can&#39;t appear in unrestricted contexts the way Lisp macros<br>can.  Even generalized to allow function &amp; class bodies, the set of symbols<br>that may be visible inside the behavior body is limited to keywords &amp;<br>argument lists in the language definition itself; you don&#39;t need to build a<br>whole symbol table to see which symbols are visible inside the behavior,<br>and you don&#39;t need to worry about inserting arbitrary blocks of code into<br>arbitrary insertion points.

But I feel the current proposal is trying to handle too many disparate use cases using an approach that doesn&#39;t work that well for all of them.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I already expressed my view of this in pre-review, and I&#39;m a bit disappointed to see no mention of my suggestions in the &quot;Alternatives considered&quot; section. Basically I think this proposal should be broken in three or four separate smaller features that can each stand on their own:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1. the ability to add `func`, `var`, and `let` inside any property declaration to handle metadata and meta-operations. For instance:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	var count: Int {<br>&gt; 		func reset() { count = 0 }<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	count::reset() // or some other syntax<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	var root: NSObject {<br>&gt; 		var lastModified: NSDate? = nil<br>&gt; 		didSet { lastModified = NSDate() }<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	print(root::lastAccess)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	var lang: String {<br>&gt; 		let xmlName = &quot;xml:lang&quot;<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	element.addAttribute(name: lang::xmlName, value: lang)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2. the ability to encapsulate those `func` and `var` inside a behaviour for reuse:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	behavior resettable&lt;T&gt;: T {<br>&gt; 		func reset() { currentValue = initValue }<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; 	var [resettable] count: Int<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	count::reset() // or some other syntax<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	behavior changeMonitored&lt;T&gt;: T {<br>&gt; 		var lastModified: NSDate? = nil<br>&gt; 		didSet { lastModified = NSDate() }<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; 	var [changeMonitored] root: NSObject<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	print(root::lastModified)<br></p><p>I think the whole space of out-of-band meta-operations deserves its own separate discussion.

In addition to your concerns, exposing metaoperations as interface also introduces bigger concerns about resilience, protocol conformance, etc. that deserve deeper consideration.<br></p><p>The way I see it, those meta-operations are just functions enclosed inside the variable&#39;s namespace. So in a protocol, and from an API point of view, they&#39;d look like this:<br></p><p>	protocol MyCounter {<br>		var count: Int {<br>			get<br>			set<br>			func reset()<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>Here, you don&#39;t need to know that `reset` is provided by a particular behavior. That is just an implementation detail.<br></p><p>I find your behavior proposal lacking in that regard. A behavior contains both the interface and the implementation of those meta-operations. It shouldn&#39;t. If you want to implement @resettable differently for one of the variables, that should not be visible to the outside world. The default implementation of @resettable shouldn&#39;t be the only one allowed.<br></p><p>It&#39;s interesting that your current implementation uses a protocol with a protocol extension to define behaviors, because the more I think about behaviors the more I believe they should be like a protocol and provide only the interface. The above could be reformulated like this:<br></p><p>	protocol Resettable {<br>		func reset()<br>	}<br>	protocol MyCounter {<br>		@Resettable var count: Int { get set }<br>	}<br></p><p><br>&gt; As I noted in your pre-review comments, trying to separate storage control from observers doesn&#39;t seem like a net simplification to me. If you try to extend either feature on its own, you end up encroaching in the other&#39;s space. A behavior that manipulates storage may need per-declaration hooks, which accessor provides. An accessor may need to introduce bookkeeping storage.<br></p><p>An &quot;accessor hook&quot; is not at all the same thing as an &quot;observer&quot; like `willSet` in my mind. A hook from a behavior is more like requirement of something that must be provided. You are proposing that this requirement be expressed using a syntax similar observers like `willSet`, but I&#39;m not sure reusing the same syntax it&#39;s the right thing to do.<br></p><p>If a behavior was a protocol, it could do what a protocol is good at: define requirements (hooks) and leave those requirements to be implemented by the property definition. You could then implement them in the property definition itself:<br></p><p>	protocol Resettable {<br>		func reset()<br>	}<br>	@Resettable var count: Int {<br>		func reset() { count = 0 }<br>	}<br></p><p>And if a behavior was a protocol, then you could also provide a default implemenation as a protocol extension. Here I&#39;ll make the protocol conform to a magic `eager var` protocol that makes available the init value for protocol extensions:<br></p><p>	protocol Resettable: eager var {<br>		func reset()<br>	}<br>	extension Resettable {<br>		// `value` accessible because this protocol inherits from `var`<br>		// `evalInitValue` accessible here because this protocol inherits from `eager var`<br>		func reset() { value = evalInitValue() }<br>	}<br>	@Resettable var count: Int<br></p><p>And you could allow the behavior to be something else than a protocol too. For instance, allow it to be a struct if you need to implement your own storage:<br></p><p>	struct DelayedStorage&lt;Value&gt; {<br>		var storage: Value?<br>		var value: Value {<br>			get {<br>				guard let theValue = storage else {<br>					fatalError(&quot;delayedImmutable property read before initialization&quot;)<br>				}<br>				return theValue<br>			}<br>			set {<br>				guard storage == nil else {<br>					fatalError(&quot;delayedImmutable property rewritten after initialization&quot;)<br>				}<br>				storage = newValue<br>			}<br>		}<br></p><p>		init() {<br>			storage = nil<br>		}<br>	}<br>	@DelayedStorage var outlet: UIView<br></p><p>And if you need access to the initial value within the struct, you can make the struct inherit from `deferred var` or `eager var` which would make the initial value accessible as an inherited member:<br></p><p>	struct Lazy&lt;Value&gt;: deferred var {<br>		var storage: Value?<br>		var value: Value {<br>			mutating get {<br>				guard let theValue = storage else {<br>					// evalInitValue accessible because this struct inherits from `eager var`<br>					storage = evalInitValue()<br>				}<br>				return theValue<br>			}<br>			set {<br>				storage = newValue<br>			}<br>		}<br></p><p>		// does not allow initialization with a value (no constructor for it)<br>		init() {<br>			storage = nil<br>		}<br>	}<br>	@Lazy var processorCount: Int = NSProcessInfo.processInfo().processorCount<br></p><p>If a struct or a protocol inherit from `var`, then its methods have access to the outer context (the scope the var lives in if it&#39;s a struct or a class). That scope would be exposed through the `context` member also inherited from `var`. And to better make use of it, you should also be able to constrain the context the `var` lives in:<br></p><p>	protocol Synchronizable {<br>		func withLock&lt;T&gt;(@noescape task: () -&gt; T) -&gt; T<br>	}<br>	struct Synchronized&lt;Value&gt;: var in Synchronizable {<br>		var storage: Value<br>		var value: Value {<br>			get {<br>				context.withLock {<br>					return storage<br>				}<br>			}<br>			set {<br>				context.withLock {<br>					storage = newValue<br>				}<br>			}<br>		}<br></p><p>		init(_ initValue: Value) {<br>			storage = initValue<br>		}<br>	}<br>	@Synchronized var faultCount: Int = 0<br></p><p>Using a mix of protocols and structs for behaviors allows protocols to define the interface while a struct and/or extensions and/or the property declaration can provide the implementation. All this gives a lot of flexibility in how to implement what is exposed in the interface.<br></p><p><br>So, to summarize, that would decompose property behaviors in a couple of smaller features:<br></p><p>1.	The ability to use a struct as a wrapper for a property&#39;s value: the `value` property of the struct becomes the property&#39;s value and other members are accessible using an out-of-band member access operator.<br>2. 	The ability for a property to define out-of-band members (`var`s `let`s, and `func`s) inline inside the property declaration (like a custom `reset` function) that can be accessed using the out-of-band member access operator.<br>3.	The ability to have a property conform to a protocol that either the storage struct, a protocol extension, or the inline out-of-band members defined in the property must implement.<br>4.	The ability for a protocol or struct to inherit from `var`, which would add the `value` and `context` members. The `evalInitValue` member would only be available for `deferred var` or `eager var`, and in the case of `deferred var` not available in the constructor (because it might require `self` from the outer context).<br>5.	Observers, like `willSet`, `willChange`, etc. can be implemented as a separate `observer` construct that can be used on any property simply by writing the observer inside the property declaration. (As discussed in my previous email.)<br></p><p>There&#39;s something else interesting with this type-based approach. Take note of how the `DelayedStorage` struct above does not inherit from `var`. That&#39;s because DelayedStorage does not need access to the outer context or `evalInitValue()`. And this makes `DelayedStorage` a perfectly valid struct to use elsewhere, such as:<br></p><p>	var delayedObjects: [DelayedStorage&lt;NSObject&gt;]<br></p><p>You could implement Atomic, NSCopying, and many other behaviors this way and be able to reuse them elsewhere.<br></p><p>And, just teasing... but maybe there&#39;s a way a behavior could be attached as a type modifier instead of a property modifier. This would allow you to write `var delayedObjects: [@DelayedStorage NSObject]` and not have to access the value by appending `.value` every time.<br></p><p><br>-- <br>Michel Fortin<br>https://michelf.ca<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0030 Property Behaviors</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>February 19, 2016 at 10:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; For instance, allow it to be a struct if you need to implement your own storage:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	struct DelayedStorage&lt;Value&gt; {<br>&gt; 		var storage: Value?<br>&gt; 		var value: Value {<br>&gt; 			get {<br>&gt; 				guard let theValue = storage else {<br>&gt; 					fatalError(&quot;delayedImmutable property read before initialization&quot;)<br>&gt; 				}<br>&gt; 				return theValue<br>&gt; 			}<br>&gt; 			set {<br>&gt; 				guard storage == nil else {<br>&gt; 					fatalError(&quot;delayedImmutable property rewritten after initialization&quot;)<br>&gt; 				}<br>&gt; 				storage = newValue<br>&gt; 			}<br>&gt; 		}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 		init() {<br>&gt; 			storage = nil<br>&gt; 		}<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; 	@DelayedStorage var outlet: UIView<br></p><p>Some of the points in the &quot;Using a protocol (formal or not) instead of a new declaration&quot; alternative discussed in the proposal (https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0030-property-behavior-decls.md#using-a-protocol-formal-or-not-instead-of-a-new-declaration) are relevant to this suggestion too:<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Behaviors would pollute the namespace, potentially with multiple global functions and/or types.<br>&gt; 	• In practice, it would require every behavior to be implemented using a new (usually generic) type, which introduces runtime overhead for the type&#39;s metadata structures.<br>&gt; 	• The property behavior logic ends up less clear, being encoded in unspecialized language constructs.<br></p><p><br>In particular, note the point about runtime overhead.

This `DelayedStorage` struct is useful as a regular type too. The `Resettable` protocol can be implemented by types too.

So I&#39;m not sure how much of the analysis still applies.<br></p><p><br>&gt;&gt; 	• The property behavior logic ends up less clear, being encoded in unspecialized language constructs.<br></p><p>The same could be said about the current proposal: it attempts to unite all loosely related kinds of behaviors under a single unspecialized declaration syntax. We don&#39;t have one `type` declaration for types: instead we have `struct`, `class`, `enum`, and `protocol` which are different kinds of types with slightly different semantics.<br></p><p>With my proposal a property behavior behaves pretty much as a type, and will often be perfectly usable as a standalone type, so I felt things would end up being clearer as types rather than almost-type things. Not that I would really mind making them non-types on as separate namespace.<br></p><p><br>&gt; In particular, note the point about runtime overhead.

A struct or protocol that inherits from `eager var` or `deferred var` has access to a `evalInitValue` closure provided as a third hidden argument. Syntactically, it just look like additional inherited members though.<br></p><p>A struct or protocol that does not inherit from `var` is just a regular struct or protocol: methods have no access to the outer context and the init value is only made available as an argument to the struct constructor.<br></p><p>Perhaps this mechanism is a bit too convoluted?<br></p><p>The only place I can find where this breaks is if the storage behavior needs some hooks. I had not realized this at first because hooks work really well with protocols used as behaviors, but structs cannot define abstract members. So that&#39;s a downside of this approach. It could be alleviated by making the struct declaration require that the inherited `var` implements a protocol:<br></p><p>	protocol DefaultValueProvider {<br>		associatedType Value<br>		var defaultValue: Value<br>	}<br>	struct Resettable&lt;Value&gt;: var&lt;DefaultValueProvider&gt; {<br>		var value: Value<br>		init() { value = defaultValue }<br>		func reset() { value = defaultValue }<br>	}<br></p><p>but I&#39;m not sure how the underlying implementation would work here. It&#39;s also becoming a bit messy syntactically. That&#39;s perhaps a sign that we need a better dedicated construct to deal with this.<br></p><p><br></p><p>&gt;&gt; And, just teasing... but maybe there&#39;s a way a behavior could be attached as a type modifier instead of a property modifier. This would allow you to write `var delayedObjects: [@DelayedStorage NSObject]` and not have to access the value by appending `.value` every time.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I think this is fraught with difficulties that will make it impractical at best.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Suppose you have a property `var foo: @Lazy Foo`, and you assign it to a variable like so: `let bar = foo`. What is the type of `bar`? Does `@Lazy` follow it somehow? What does it even mean if it does?<br></p><p>First, `@Lazy` cannot be used as a type modifier. It is defined as conforming to/inheriting from `deferred var` which means it applies only to `var`. That&#39;s needed for it to access `evalInitValue`. (You could redefine `Lazy` to store a closure, which is suboptimal in many ways but that would make it work as a type behavior. Let&#39;s assume this for the rest of the discussion.)<br></p><p>What is the type of `bar`. Quite simple, the type of bar is the type of `foo::value`. The general idea is that referencing to the property without the out-of-band member access operator (I&#39;m using `::` for that) is equivalent to appending `::value`:<br></p><p>	foo = bar<br>	// is the same as<br>	foo = bar::value<br></p><p>If you used `Lazy&lt;Foo&gt;` instead of `@Lazy Foo`, then you&#39;d have to add the `.value` yourself, and `bar = foo` would make `bar` of type `Lazy&lt;Foo&gt;` instead of `Foo`.<br></p><p><br>&gt; Suppose you have an `Array&lt;@DelayedStorage NSObject&gt;` and a method which expects an `Array&lt;NSObject&gt;`. Can you pass the array to the method? Is this answer correct for all possible behaviors?<br></p><p>That&#39;s not possible because the memory layout is different. We have the same problem with protocols: you can&#39;t convert `Array&lt;SomeObject&gt;` to `Array&lt;SomeProtocol&gt;` in the general case where `SomeObject` conforms to `SomeProtocol`.<br></p><p><br>&gt; Suppose you have an `Array&lt;NSObject&gt;` and a property which contains an `Array&lt;@DelayedStorage NSObject&gt;`. Can you assign the array to the property? Is this answer correct for all possible behaviors?<br></p><p>Again no. Same problem as above.<br></p><p><br>&gt; Suppose you have an `Array&lt;@DelayedStorage NSObject&gt;`. What type should `Element` be in each of these Array members?<br></p><p>I get your point here. The type of `Element` has to be `NSObject`, not `@DelayedStorage NSObject` for all the functions and methods to work as intended. There&#39;s one way to &quot;fix&quot; this: parametrize the behavior type separately in the declaration of a generic:<br></p><p>	struct Array&lt;@B T&gt; { ... }<br></p><p>and here the array could reuse `@B T` for its storage, but just `T` elsewhere:<br></p><p>	var x: @B T // using the generic behavior<br>	var y: T // not using the generic behavior<br></p><p>That means that generics would need to opt-in in order to allow a type behavior in their type arguments, and then carefully decide where to use the behavior and when not to use it. I think that&#39;s an interesting concept, but it complicates things a bit more than I expected, perhaps to a point where it&#39;s not worth it.<br></p><p><br>&gt; Ultimately, my sense is that trying to make behaviors-as-implicit-types in this fashion ends up with a lot of the problems of implicitly unwrapped optionals: essentially, it&#39;s hard to tell how far type inference will propagate the implicit types, or when the special implicit logic is invoked. We want less of that, not more.<br></p><p>Implicitly unwrapped optionals are indeed an apt comparison.<br></p><p><br>-- <br>Michel Fortin<br>https://michelf.ca<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/566528c7f7c28c35c0c646d415943612?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0030 Property Behaviors</strong> from <string>Taras Zakharko</string> &lt;taras.zakharko at uzh.ch&gt;<p>February 22, 2016 at 07:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>I waned to write only a quick note, but in the end it became to verbose, so I will reiterate main points here for clarity, and point to the bottom of this mail for my original messy text with more details<br></p><p>1.

In addition to your concerns, exposing metaoperations as interface also introduces bigger concerns about resilience, protocol conformance, etc. that deserve deeper consideration.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The way I see it, those meta-operations are just functions enclosed inside the variable&#39;s namespace. So in a protocol, and from an API point of view, they&#39;d look like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	protocol MyCounter {<br>&gt; 		var count: Int {<br>&gt; 			get<br>&gt; 			set<br>&gt; 			func reset()<br>&gt; 		}<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Here, you don&#39;t need to know that `reset` is provided by a particular behavior. That is just an implementation detail.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I find your behavior proposal lacking in that regard. A behavior contains both the interface and the implementation of those meta-operations. It shouldn&#39;t. If you want to implement @resettable differently for one of the variables, that should not be visible to the outside world. The default implementation of @resettable shouldn&#39;t be the only one allowed.<br></p><p>Yeah, I agree that meta-operations, when they exist, probably make sense as interfaces decoupled from any concrete implementation. Without that feature, though, behaviors as I&#39;ve proposed are purely an implementation detail of the properties that use them. It makes sense to consider meta-operations as a separate feature for that reason.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; It&#39;s interesting that your current implementation uses a protocol with a protocol extension to define behaviors, because the more I think about behaviors the more I believe they should be like a protocol and provide only the interface. The above could be reformulated like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	protocol Resettable {<br>&gt; 		func reset()<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; 	protocol MyCounter {<br>&gt; 		@Resettable var count: Int { get set }<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; As I noted in your pre-review comments, trying to separate storage control from observers doesn&#39;t seem like a net simplification to me. If you try to extend either feature on its own, you end up encroaching in the other&#39;s space. A behavior that manipulates storage may need per-declaration hooks, which accessor provides. An accessor may need to introduce bookkeeping storage.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; An &quot;accessor hook&quot; is not at all the same thing as an &quot;observer&quot; like `willSet` in my mind. A hook from a behavior is more like requirement of something that must be provided. You are proposing that this requirement be expressed using a syntax similar observers like `willSet`, but I&#39;m not sure reusing the same syntax it&#39;s the right thing to do.<br></p><p>Observers, like other behaviors, are allowing a property declaration to provide a block of code that fills in customization points in an otherwise pre-fab property implementation. From an implementation perspective that&#39;s not so different from a lazy property binding the initializer value.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; If a behavior was a protocol, it could do what a protocol is good at: define requirements (hooks) and leave those requirements to be implemented by the property definition. You could then implement them in the property definition itself:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	protocol Resettable {<br>&gt; 		func reset()<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; 	@Resettable var count: Int {<br>&gt; 		func reset() { count = 0 }<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; And if a behavior was a protocol, then you could also provide a default implemenation as a protocol extension. Here I&#39;ll make the protocol conform to a magic `eager var` protocol that makes available the init value for protocol extensions:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	protocol Resettable: eager var {<br>&gt; 		func reset()<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; 	extension Resettable {<br>&gt; 		// `value` accessible because this protocol inherits from `var`<br>&gt; 		// `evalInitValue` accessible here because this protocol inherits from `eager var`<br>&gt; 		func reset() { value = evalInitValue() }<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; 	@Resettable var count: Int<br>&gt; <br>&gt; And you could allow the behavior to be something else than a protocol too. For instance, allow it to be a struct if you need to implement your own storage:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	struct DelayedStorage&lt;Value&gt; {<br>&gt; 		var storage: Value?<br>&gt; 		var value: Value {<br>&gt; 			get {<br>&gt; 				guard let theValue = storage else {<br>&gt; 					fatalError(&quot;delayedImmutable property read before initialization&quot;)<br>&gt; 				}<br>&gt; 				return theValue<br>&gt; 			}<br>&gt; 			set {<br>&gt; 				guard storage == nil else {<br>&gt; 					fatalError(&quot;delayedImmutable property rewritten after initialization&quot;)<br>&gt; 				}<br>&gt; 				storage = newValue<br>&gt; 			}<br>&gt; 		}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 		init() {<br>&gt; 			storage = nil<br>&gt; 		}<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; 	@DelayedStorage var outlet: UIView<br>&gt; <br>&gt; And if you need access to the initial value within the struct, you can make the struct inherit from `deferred var` or `eager var` which would make the initial value accessible as an inherited member:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	struct Lazy&lt;Value&gt;: deferred var {<br>&gt; 		var storage: Value?<br>&gt; 		var value: Value {<br>&gt; 			mutating get {<br>&gt; 				guard let theValue = storage else {<br>&gt; 					// evalInitValue accessible because this struct inherits from `eager var`<br>&gt; 					storage = evalInitValue()<br>&gt; 				}<br>&gt; 				return theValue<br>&gt; 			}<br>&gt; 			set {<br>&gt; 				storage = newValue<br>&gt; 			}<br>&gt; 		}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 		// does not allow initialization with a value (no constructor for it)<br>&gt; 		init() {<br>&gt; 			storage = nil<br>&gt; 		}<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; 	@Lazy var processorCount: Int = NSProcessInfo.processInfo().processorCount<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If a struct or a protocol inherit from `var`, then its methods have access to the outer context (the scope the var lives in if it&#39;s a struct or a class). That scope would be exposed through the `context` member also inherited from `var`. And to better make use of it, you should also be able to constrain the context the `var` lives in:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	protocol Synchronizable {<br>&gt; 		func withLock&lt;T&gt;(@noescape task: () -&gt; T) -&gt; T<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; 	struct Synchronized&lt;Value&gt;: var in Synchronizable {<br>&gt; 		var storage: Value<br>&gt; 		var value: Value {<br>&gt; 			get {<br>&gt; 				context.withLock {<br>&gt; 					return storage<br>&gt; 				}<br>&gt; 			}<br>&gt; 			set {<br>&gt; 				context.withLock {<br>&gt; 					storage = newValue<br>&gt; 				}<br>&gt; 			}<br>&gt; 		}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 		init(_ initValue: Value) {<br>&gt; 			storage = initValue<br>&gt; 		}<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; 	@Synchronized var faultCount: Int = 0<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Using a mix of protocols and structs for behaviors allows protocols to define the interface while a struct and/or extensions and/or the property declaration can provide the implementation. All this gives a lot of flexibility in how to implement what is exposed in the interface.<br></p><p>That&#39;s an interesting approach. A similar effect can be achieved with protocols and protocol extensions alone, though. You could have a fully abstract behavior protocol &quot;resetting&quot; that declares the interface of a property with a `reset` metaoperation, and declare that as API, while satisfying the implementation with a refined protocol &quot;resetToConstant&quot; that provides the concrete implementation in an extension. I think that keeping the feature tied to protocols (sugared or not) keeps the model simpler. I also have trouble seeing how most behaviors would be useful as standalone types by themselves.<br></p><p>-Joe<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b6a0b6562cd412f587c69d192f335161?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0030 Property Behaviors</strong> from <string>plx</string> &lt;plxswift at icloud.com&gt;<p>February 14, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>It’s “ok”.

If I was writing a library to parse the options to `swiftc` for example, an application might want to declare a structure like<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; struct Options: String {<br>&gt;&gt; 	let applicationExtension : Bool<br>&gt;&gt;         let assertConfig: Bool<br>&gt;&gt;         let embedBitcodeMarker: Bool<br>&gt;&gt;         let emitBitcode: Bool<br>&gt;&gt;        //etc<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; ...and use this application-provided structure as part of the API itself.  With clever use of Mirror, a library can reflect this structure, re-interpret the names under command-line-case-rules, and generate a parser that can read &quot;-application-extension&quot; &quot;-assert-config&quot; &quot;embed-bitcode-marker&quot; and so on.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; However, while a library can understand this structure, it cannot set the values back on the structure defined by the application.  Thus the application is doomed to work with a parse result object that has poor type information (such as a stringly-typed result).  This basically negates the benefit of declaring a structure like this to begin with.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; After this proposal, I can define a property behavior that relocates the variable storage to a stringly-typed underlying mechanism.  As a result, I can construct a full-duplex bridge between &quot;stringly-typed&quot; access patterns and &quot;statically-typed&quot; access patterns, allowing me to alternate between one and the other as necessary.  I can also get &quot;writeable&quot; reflection behavior.  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I think the benefits of such a scheme (particularly as an opt-in mechanism, so as not to impact performance in general) is pretty endless.  The API that I describe seems &quot;obviously&quot; the optimal API for practically any parse problem that terminates in a strongly typed structure (which is the case for most JSON, YAML, XML, CSV, CLI, and RPC-type application-layer problems), and under this proposal it becomes achievable.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; One obvious extension I would like to see is &quot;function behaviors&quot; (a.k.a. decorators), but that is obviously a story for another proposal.  Still, I would be really interested in studying in that direction in future proposals.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; As others have mentioned, composeability is also interesting, but may not be entirely necessary for an initial pass at the feature.  This seems like something that should be evaluated in the context of &quot;so now we have two different libraries that each want their behavior on a property,&quot; which is a circumstance far removed from the present.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; As explained above, the proposal can bridge an important problem; namely allowing dynamic behavior in a static type system.  I think that this would allow clever library authors to design more Swift-like APIs.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	• If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I am familiar with function decorators in Python, which are a generalization of this scheme (they&#39;re composeable and they also work for functions).  I miss decorators terribly in Swift.  These are not quite as good, but they&#39;re a step.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	• How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve tried to get to the meat of the proposal.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I&#39;m deliberately avoiding the syntax bikeshed here–I&#39;m much more interested in the behavior this proposal unlocks than the color of the paint.  Paint the damn thing any color you like, but the underlying idea here is a really important step towards more dynamic kinds of runtime behaviors.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Drew<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160216/1ee8a5c0/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/06c1dcc7dce6a93d194b9c013376e3f0?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0030 Property Behaviors</strong> from <string>Joe Groff</string> &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt;<p>February 17, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>If anyone wants to start playing with the feature, I now have some of the core functionality working in a branch:<br></p><p>https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1297<br></p><p>I didn&#39;t want to waste time parsing a behavior declaration syntax while we&#39;re still painting the bikeshed, so behaviors are currently exposed as protocols with extension methods following a convention:<br></p><p>protocol delayedImmutable {<br>  // Type of the property.<br>  associatedtype Value<br>  // Storage required by the property.<br>  var storage: Value? { get set }<br>}<br>extension delayedImmutable {<br>  // Implementation of the property.<br>  var value: Value {<br>    // The property can only be read after it&#39;s been initialized.<br>    get {<br>      guard let theValue = storage else {<br>        fatalError(&quot;delayedImmutable property read before initialization&quot;)<br>      }<br>      return theValue<br>    }<br>    <br>    // The property can only be written once to initialize it.<br>    set {<br>      guard storage == nil else {<br>        fatalError(&quot;delayedImmutable property rewritten after initialization&quot;)<br>      }<br>      storage = newValue<br>    }<br>  }<br></p><p>  // Initialization logic for the property storage.<br>  static func initStorage() -&gt; Value? {<br>    return nil<br>  }<br>}<br></p><p>Custom accessors and initializer expression bindings aren&#39;t handled yet, but there&#39;s enough there now to implement `delayed` initialization.

I personally like it outside because it mirrors the declaration of the actual property.  <br></p><p>Also, I know the current proposal does not have a binding to get a hold of the property name.  But let’s suppose that we wanted to add one as in the behavior declaration below.  Notice that the right hand side of the behavior declaration (in bold) mirrors the property name, the value type and initial value respectively of a var declaration.  Based on this, I find it intuitive to make the connection and understand what name, Value and initialValue are referring to.  No need to have special declarations in the body of the behavior.  <br></p><p>At some point you had provided an “echo” property that showed the use of the name binding to get a hold of the property name.  Then in subsequent proposals you had an _ for the place of the property name in the behavior declaration.  Now I see that it’s been completely dropped.  I personally liked it and think it could be useful.  I probably missed in past discussions the reason why the binding for the property name was dropped.  Do you see it coming back, perhaps in a separate proposal?<br></p><p>As far as @lazy, etc. to annotate var declarations and have them use property behaviors, I cannot think of any reasons why not.

I continued to be thrilled with the proposal and the directions in which behaviors can evolve.<br></p><p>We could conceivably infer the intended initial value semantics from the behavior&#39;s implementation, but in Swift we generally try to keep interfaces explicit. Whether an initial value is required and when it&#39;s evaluated are important parts of how you use the behavior. Even if we inferred the initial value semantics from the implementation, we would still need a way to express the semantics in the behavior&#39;s interface when it&#39;s printed from other modules.<br></p><p>-Joe<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160220/4182bdee/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0030 Property Behaviors</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>February 19, 2016 at 12:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Based on review feedback, I&#39;ve revised the declaration syntax proposal for property behaviors to be more in line with our other declaration forms, reverting to the earlier pre-review &quot;var behavior&quot; proposal. I&#39;ve updated the proposal in swift-evolution:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0030-property-behavior-decls.md<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In discussion with the core team, we&#39;ve also strongly come in favor of applying behaviors to properties using attribute syntax, e.g.:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; @lazy var x = 111<br>&gt; @delayed var x: Int<br>&gt; <br>&gt; They&#39;re definitely attribute-like, and we think it makes sense for behaviors to be the first of hopefully many kinds of user-defined behaviors. What do you all think of this direction?<br></p><p>I like all of this overall. Discussion in a few parts below.<br></p><p>***<br></p><p>I&#39;m fine with the new declaration syntax. I thought the declaration-follows-use syntax was unusually well suited to this feature since it more or less acts as a template for code surrounding a property, but there&#39;s nothing wrong with this new alternative.<br></p><p>I think the one part I don&#39;t really like is the first three words. It&#39;s a little odd having so many lowercase keywords in a row without any punctuation; I&#39;d prefer a syntax with more texture. More worryingly, though, it appears that Apple frameworks have at least four public classes with properties called `behavior`, including `NSPopover`; these could be mistaken for behavior declarations. I see a few potential solutions here:<br></p><p>1. Disambiguate on the absence of punctuation; `var behavior` without a `:` or `=` after it can&#39;t be a property, so it must be a variable behavior. This seems mistake-prone, though:<br>	var behavior NSPopoverBehavior<br>	<br>2. Require backticks if you&#39;re declaring a property. This is the simplest solution, but kind of ugly.<br>	var `behavior`: NSPopoverBehavior<br></p><p>3. Reverse the order of the keywords, yielding `behavior var`. This avoids ambiguity, but it doesn&#39;t read as well:<br>	behavior var lazy&lt;Value&gt;: Value<br></p><p>4. Require the usage punctuation, whatever it is, at the declaration site. (I&#39;ll assume `@`.) `:` or `=` is a property named &quot;behavior&quot;; `@` is a property behavior; anything else is an error. This also gives the declaration some of that missing texture I was complaining about.<br>	var behavior @lazy&lt;Value&gt;: Value<br></p><p>(Technically, the `behavior` keyword is redundant in option 4, but I think it&#39;s valuable as something you can search for when you see `var @lazy` and have no idea what that means.)<br></p><p>***<br></p><p>One thing I don&#39;t like about this new syntax is the standalone `initialValue` keyword (nor the similar `name` keyword in Future Directions, which has a type attached for additional weirdness). I&#39;m wondering if instead, we can have the user declare an accessor named `initialValue`:<br></p><p>	var behavior lazy&lt;Value&gt;: Value {<br>		accessor initialValue() -&gt; Value<br>		<br>		private var value: Value?<br>		<br>		mutating get {<br>			value ??= initialValue()	// Borrowing syntax from SE-0024: Optional Value Setter<br>			return value!<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>This turns the computed property into a function, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessarily a bad thing. But if you want it to remain a computed property, I do have another option for you.<br></p><p>Suppose we allow accessors to be either methods *or* readonly computed properties. In the past, we&#39;ve discussed parameterizing behaviors; this would be a way to do it. For example:<br></p><p>	var behavior json&lt;Value: JSONRepresentable where Self: JSONObject&gt;: Value {<br>		// Accessor methods now carry an additional `func` keyword:<br>		accessor func toJSON(value: Value) -&gt; JSONValue {<br>			return value.json<br>		}<br>		accessor func fromJSON(json: JSONValue) -&gt; Value {<br>			return Value(json: json as! Value.JSONRepresentation)<br>		}<br>		<br>		// And we can now say:<br>		<br>		accessor var key: String<br>		<br>		// `key` is a readonly computed property which is bound to the expression provided <br>		// when the behavior is applied to the property.<br>		// <br>		// Just as you can provide an accessor method with a default implementation, so you <br>		// can provide an accessor property with a default value. For instance, if `#name` were<br>		// the syntax to access the property name, the above could be:<br>		// <br>		//	accessor var key = #name<br>		<br>		get {<br>			return fromJSON(self.json[key])<br>		}<br>		set {<br>			self.json[key] = toJSON(newValue)<br>		}<br>	}<br>	<br>	struct Person: JSONObject {<br>		var json: [String: JSONValue]<br>		<br>		// I have two different ideas for the syntax at the application site.<br>		<br>		// Option 1:<br>		@json var identifier: String { key = &quot;id&quot; }<br>		<br>		// Option 2:<br>		@json(key=&quot;id&quot;) var identifier: String<br></p><p>		// Note: The `=` in Option 2 would become a `:` if Erica Sadun&#39;s draft proposal on using <br>		// colons in attributes is accepted.<br>	}<br></p><p>(If we take option 2, there are all sorts of things we can consider doing to bring behavior accessor vars in line with the things we currently see in attribute parameters. For instance, we could allow boolean accessor vars to be set by the presence or absence of their name in the list, without a `true` value being included. We might also allow you to give an accessor var an external name of _ to indicate that no label is needed. If we make this sophisticated enough, we might be able to turn many attributes into empty behaviors that the compiler knows are magic. For instance, if we&#39;re willing to turn @objc(foo) into @objc(&quot;foo&quot;):<br></p><p>	// `Value: @objc` is imaginary syntax for &quot;any Objective-C-compatible type&quot;.<br>	var behavior objc&lt;Value: @objc&gt;: Value {<br>		accessor var _ objCName: StaticString = #name<br>		<br>		var value: Value<br>		get { return value }<br>		set { value = newValue }<br>		<br>		// The compiler knows about this behavior and looks in its `objCName` <br>		// when it&#39;s writing the Objective-C metadata.<br>	}<br></p><p>But I&#39;m digressing.)<br></p><p>With the basic accessor var feature in place—no fancy parameter syntax extensions needed—`initialValue` could be declared as an accessor var:<br></p><p>	var behavior lazy&lt;Value&gt;: Value {<br>		accessor var initialValue: Value<br>		<br>		private var value: Value?<br>		<br>		mutating get {<br>			value ??= initialValue()<br>			return value!<br>		}<br>	}<br>	<br>	@lazy var foo = Bar()<br>	// Exactly equivalent to:<br>	@lazy var foo: Bar {<br>		initialValue = Bar()<br>	}<br>	// Or:<br>	@lazy(initialValue=Bar()) var foo: Bar<br></p><p>If we take this course, then when the time comes to do names, we could of course use another magic `accessor var`:<br></p><p>	var behavior json&lt;Value: JSONRepresentable where Self: JSONObject&gt;: Value {<br>		accessor var name: String<br>		accessor var key: String = name<br>		…<br></p><p>That seems like it might be a feature worth having.<br></p><p>***<br></p><p>On the `@runcible` syntax, I believe I recommended using it pretty early on, so obviously I approve. :^) The proposal currently still shows the `[runcible]` syntax; I take it that just hasn&#39;t been updated? <br></p><p>(I previously had a big section here talking about how to adapt behavior composition to this new syntax, but it grew into a horrendous monster inside an already long email, so I&#39;ve cut it out to avoid cluttering the review. I&#39;ll send it to the list as a new thread.)<br></p><p>***<br></p><p>Incidentally, while I was writing up the JSON example, I thought of another item for the Future Directions list: behavior extensions. It&#39;d be nice if I could do something like this:<br></p><p>	var behavior json&lt;Value where Self: JSONObject&gt;: Value {<br>		accessor var key: String<br>		<br>		accessor func toJSON(value: Value) -&gt; JSONValue<br>		accessor func fromJSON(json: JSONValue) -&gt; Value<br></p><p>		get {<br>			return fromJSON(self.json[key])<br>		}<br>		set {<br>			self.jsonObject[key] = toJSON(newValue)<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>	extension var behavior json where Value: JSONRepresentable {<br>		accessor func toJSON(value: Value) -&gt; JSONValue {<br>			return value.json<br>		}<br>		accessor func fromJSON(json: JSONValue) -&gt; Value {<br>			return Value(json: json as! Value.JSONRepresentation)<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>Behavior extensions would probably only be able to add accessor defaults and *maybe* methods and computed properties. I don&#39;t think they could add a setter, stored properties, initializers, or new accessors.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/05e222e6ef4d84013bb3baeb0e25c90b?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0030 Property Behaviors</strong> from <string>Patrick Gili</string> &lt;gili.patrick.r at gili-labs.com&gt;<p>February 19, 2016 at 08:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>Hi Joe,<br></p><p>What you have presented below looks good to me.

Unspecialized code would generate type metadata records for every lazy&lt;T&gt; it instantiated at runtime.<br></p><p>- A purely type-encapsulated property delegate design like Kotlin&#39;s requires the property delegate instance to carry any information about the declaration it may need for later inside the instance itself; for instance, for a lazy property, the closure that evaluates the initial value would have to be stored in-line inside every instance of every property.

We’ve been discussing this a lot in the thread on enforcing super method requirements; while my preference in that case is for an attribute, I feel it is appropriate there because they’re more like directives and informative, and will generate warnings (and possibly errors too) in the same way as @warn_unused_result does. A lot of other attributes are either informational or are produce some kind of restriction that the compiler warns us about (or errors on).<br></p><p>However, property behaviours are more like defining protocols for properties, which is clearly very different from an attribute, and IMO not really compiler magic either. I think a keyword makes most sense, such as behaviour(lazy), though personally I don’t see why we can’t just include the names directly, i.e:<br></p><p>	var lazy x = 111<br></p><p>Isn’t ambiguous, because the right most token (x) is used as the name, var is an explicitly defined keyword, therefore everything else (lazy) can be looked up as a behaviour, in much the same way as types would be.

A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br>&gt; <br>&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md&gt;<br>&gt; Thank you,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Doug Gregor<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Review Manager<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160220/d362f40f/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/831ba6eb600af4a6587f263373921bb2?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0030 Property Behaviors</strong> from <string>Tino Heth</string> &lt;2th at gmx.de&gt;<p>February 22, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>I&#39;m still very torn on this proposal, and I think a final evaluation should take into account the long-term goal of &quot;hygienic macros&quot;:<br>Right now, I haven&#39;t seen anything concrete on this topic, as it is somewhat out of scope now — but there are soaring dreams for meta programming in Swift, and behaviors could be solved that way as well.<br></p><p>It is common practice to ask the question &quot;would we add this feature now if we didn&#39;t already have it?&quot; when it is about deprecating elements of the language; I fear that property behaviors might become to important to be removed once they are integrated, so I&#39;m asking myself:<br>Would I add this feature if I could do something like<br></p><p>#Self.addProperty(&quot;age&quot;, type: Int, behavior: Lazy { return Date().year - self.birthday.year })<br></p><p>instead?<br>(this all is highly speculative, and so is the syntax — but I hope the intention is of that line is clear)<br></p><p>As the evolution process favors small steps, it is somewhat unfair to challenge a proposal this way, but imho sometimes it is important to step back and consider the &quot;big picture&quot; — which, btw, may as well lead to the conclusion that macros shouldn&#39;t be able to add behaviors, or that the feature deserves a special syntax anyways...<br></p><p>- Tino<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
