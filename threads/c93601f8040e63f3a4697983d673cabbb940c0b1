Both of them use the example of a diagramming app, where the user can make a diagram of circles and polygons. They make a protocol for Drawable (makes sense), and then make Circle and Polygon structs.<br></p><p>I&#39;m working on rewriting a long-term project of mine in Swift. It&#39;s a schematic capture CAD app, and it draws schematic diagrams built up from instances of parts from a library, and wires between them. Currently, my model is entirely made of classes, with reference semantics. I&#39;m trying to see if it wouldn&#39;t make sense to make them structs with value semantics, but I don&#39;t think it does, and I&#39;m looking for advice.<br></p><p>My model consists of the following objects: PartDefinition and PartInstance, as well as some geometric primitives. A PartDefinition has a set of properties (e.g. UUID, name, value), and a set of geometric primitives. The geometry defines the appearance on screen, and the properties give the part identity in the schematic. A PartInstance references a PartDefinition, and adds a position property (to define that instance&#39;s location in the canvas), as well as overriding zero or more of the PartDefinition&#39;s properties, or adding its own (for example, a PartInstance gets a Reference Designator, just a label for the instance, like &quot;R1&quot; or &quot;U23&quot;). A PartInstance rarely, if ever, overrides or adds geometry found in the corresponding PartDefinition.<br></p><p>The reason I don&#39;t think these work so well with value semantics is that they can be edited by the user: they can be repositioned, properties can be changed, etc. Even the geometry of a PartDefinition can be changed, and the intended result is that all instances displayed in the canvas reflect the new geometry.<br></p><p>Similarly, in the diagramming example from the WWDC videos, how would that app handle the user editing existing Drawables in the Diagram? Let&#39;s say you allow the user to click on a Drawable and drag it to another location in the canvas. Is this reasonable:<br></p><p>- User clicks with the mouse<br>- Find the item hit by that click by iterating through the array of Drawable<br>- var currentItem = self.items[hitIndex] (makes a copy)<br>- update currentItem with whatever changes have occurred<br>- self.items[hitIndex] = currentItem (copy the new values back into the array<br>- set window needs update<br></p><p>It seems like reference semantics are more appropriate here.<br></p><p>Thoughts?

The number one consideration for choosing between a value type and a reference type is “do I want value semantics or reference semantics?” If I want to talk about a particular shape, talk about “that one”, I can only do that if there’s some notion of identity. So yes, if that’s part of my app, I would start with reference types.<br></p><p>Now, that doesn’t have to apply to rendering. As shown in the presentation, if you’re generating the shapes, there’s no need to refer to a particular shape afterwards…especially if the shapes are immutable. Any individual shape is just data to be rendered. But if I want a command like “change the color of that square”, then I need a way to know what “that square” refers to, and an object with persistent identity—a class instance—is one way to do it.<br></p><p>You can get a notion of “identity” in ways other than reference semantics—say, by generating unique IDs that go with a particular shape, and then looking them up later. But it’s a perfectly fine choice to make your model use reference semantics.<br></p><p>All of that said, reference semantics do have traps: mutation makes things harder to test in isolation, and mutation with shared state makes things not thread-safe.
