The strategy seems<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rather silly.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While developing a so-called &quot;buildpack&quot; for Swift 3 projects to be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deployed via CloudFoundryish options and utilizing the &#39;swift build&#39;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; command, I have come across a few issues.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One issue is that &#39;swift build&#39; invokes and &#39;swift-build&#39; command, who<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then invokes a &#39;swiftc&#39; command, but the environment provided to this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last is insufficient for the dynamic loader to gain knowledge of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; libraries present in &quot;the hole&quot; and specified by the LD_LIBRARY_PATH<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; variable.  This variable and other environment-variables present for<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the parent processes are not provided to the &#39;swiftc&#39; command. This<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; means that libraries are searched for in the usual OS locations, but<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; due to the locked-down CloudFoundry environment, they won&#39;t be found.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At one point I was able to find a &#39;popen&#39; in an older version of Swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that seemed to be responsible, but I cannot find it in the Swift 3<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [prototype] source-code.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there a good reason to discard these environment-variables, or<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would it be reasonable to introduce some logic for &#39;swift-build&#39; to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pass its environment-variables to its child &#39;swiftc&#39; process(es)?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you for your time and attention.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-build-dev mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-build-dev at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-build-dev<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-build-dev mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-build-dev at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-build-dev<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-build-dev mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-build-dev at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-build-dev<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-build-dev mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-build-dev at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-build-dev<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
