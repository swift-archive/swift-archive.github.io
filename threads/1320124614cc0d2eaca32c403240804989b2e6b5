Feel free to correct me.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If you are using two letter acronyms, leave the entire initialism<br>&gt; consistently capitalized (#1 behavior). E.g.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 	func tee(ioInput: IOOutputStream) -&gt; (IOOutputStream, IOOutputStream)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If you are using three or more letter initialism, treat them as words<br>&gt; for capitalization. (#2 behavior) E.g.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 	func htmlDigest(for html: String) -&gt; HtmlDigest<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Visually, I find if an abbreviation is two characters long, mixed case<br>&gt; interferes with my ability to read it. Although the overloading is a<br>&gt; bit coincidental in this case, the system is not about Io the moon,<br>&gt; but IO the Input/Output concept.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Two letter abbreviations are short enough that at least I can easily<br>&gt; backtrack to say “they are not talking about some IOO concept”. The<br>&gt; more capital letters put in a sequence, the more you lose the ability<br>&gt; to disambiguate.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I’ve also found that it is very hard to turn a two letter initialism<br>&gt; into an acronym. In general, the pronounceable two letter<br>&gt; abbreviations are too short to be unambiguous when written, thus being<br>&gt; poor choices for naming in general. However, if we expect people to<br>&gt; write code on mobile phones going forward, then this may change (we<br>&gt; may be in trouble in general).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You also have few enough two letter initialisms that this does not in<br>&gt; practice run into the problems where the name of the thing is<br>&gt; described by multiple concatenated abbreviations, such as an HTML<br>&gt; DOM. Such cases of multiple two-letter abbreviations are rare enough<br>&gt; that there does not need to be consistency rules for them IMHO (or<br>&gt; shall I say, Imho)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I’ve found in practice that three letter initialisms have pros and<br>&gt; cons to being treated by each set of rule - but there are enough TLA<br>&gt; initialisms (TlaInitialism) that concatenation is more likely are<br>&gt; likely - and it is better to just treat the few two-letter initialisms<br>&gt; as special cases, and have everything else play by rule #2.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Finally, this has an interesting side benefit when you consider most<br>&gt; objective C packages have an initialism, abbreviation or mnemonic of<br>&gt; the module as a two-character prefix (even third parties often prefer<br>&gt; this over the recommended three-character prefix). Assuming that is<br>&gt; preserved on import of non-Foundation libraries, this will make such<br>&gt; code look far more consistent.<br></p><p>As I mentioned to others, if you&#39;d like to create an amended document<br>that accounts for that convention, too, I&#39;d be happy to incorporate it.<br>However, note that I&#39;ve tried pretty hard to stay away from subjective<br>factors in the analysis; it would be good if you could do the same.<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4fe988326eed161b989d0c5521cb105?s=50"></div><header><strong>Analysis of case conventions for initialisms</strong> from <string>Jordan Rose</string> &lt;jordan_rose at apple.com&gt;<p>February 12, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Feb 12, 2016, at 8:58, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; on Fri Feb 12 2016, David Waite &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Just to make things more complex, I’d like to point out I’ve used yet<br>&gt;&gt; another style myself in the past, #2 with elements of #1 which I’ll<br>&gt;&gt; refer to as #4 for the purposes of this mail.
