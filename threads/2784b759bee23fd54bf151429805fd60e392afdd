However, I don’t think “Self” is very readable or easily understandable. “dynamicType” on the other hand can hardly be misunderstood. With Self, one first has to know/understand that there is a difference between static and dynamic types, and then know/look up which of these types is returned. With dynamicType, this is clear from the beginning. If you don’t know what a dynamic type is, you will stumble over the word and there’s a much higher chance you’d do the research.

This change eliminates a special case that&#39;s out of step with Swift&#39;s new standards.<br></p><p><br>Except for the fact that `dynamicType` cannot be used with implicit self, it has always felt more like a property to me than a keyword and the capitalisation is therefore not out of place.

It mirrors self, which refers to the current instance.<br></p><p>It is undeniably shorter, but it is not clearer in intent. `self.dynamicType` clearly and explicitly tells us we are referring to the runtime type of the instance. `Self` does not. Furthermore, it overloads the word with two subtly different meanings depending on context. <br></p><p>&gt; 	• It provides an easier way to access static members. As type names grow large, readability suffers. MyExtremelyLargeTypeName.staticMember is unwieldy to type and read.<br></p><p>I reject the assertion that readability suffers with large type names. `NSApplicationDelegate` is much more readable than `NSAppDlgt` for example.<br></p><p>Furthermore, this proposal does not address the length of `MyExtremelyLargeTypeName.someMember()` since that might not be the same method as `Self.someMember()` If you explicitly want the `someMember()` defined by `MyExtremelyLargeTypeName` you still have to spell it out in case it is a class function and the dynamic type is a subclass.  <br></p><p>&gt; 	• Code using hardwired type names is less portable than code that automatically knows its type.<br></p><p>And how does `self.dynamicType` fail here?<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Renaming a type means updating any TypeName references in code.<br></p><p>This is the same point as the previous one.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Using self.dynamicType fights against Swift&#39;s goals of concision and clarity in that it is both noisy and esoteric.<br></p><p>I disagree. `self.dynamicType` is a clear and concise description of the object it represents.<br></p><p>Another observation: the proposal omits the “Impact own Existing Code” section.

One reason .self exists is to avoid the mistake of writing let x = Int — the compiler will give you a weird type error later on in code if the value of x is what we today call Int.self but you meant to call the Int() initializer. Creating a metatype is not a common operation, so doing it explicitly is a good thing.<br></p><p>Coming back to this proposal, if we removed .self why would we want to add .Self?<br></p><p>Background:<br>From Joe Groff: &quot;`.self` is also a bit of load-bearing duct-tape that currently supports some other parsing aspects of Swift&#39;s syntax.&quot; <br>Jordan Rose adds, &quot;Swift&#39;s type-checking engine is strong enough to merit not needing the redundant `.self` safety check.&quot; <br></p><p>I personally like distinguishing `Type.self` from raw `Type` use for the reasons stated. This feature affirmatively prevents the use of `Typename` when `Typename()` is meant. In terms of this proposal, can this and should this be  retained in the language but renamed from `self`? That would update the quiz to:<br></p><p>Self.&lt;runcible&gt; // T.Type<br>self.Self       // T.Type<br>Self.Self       // T.Type.Type<br>self.&lt;runcible&gt; // == self<br>Which reduces at least some of the confusion. The actual runcible name could be bikeshedded.<br></p><p>IS `Self` THE RIGHT NAME? / SHOULD `dynamicType` require `self`<br></p><p>I like `Self`.  It is an existing keyword. It matches the approach used in protocols where `Self` is a placeholder for the type that conforms to that protocol. Under SE-0068, it refers to the dynamic type of the current instance. If it has to be a choice of one or the other, I&#39;d prefer renaming `.self` and retaining `Self`. If `Self` is not the right name, I&#39;d recommend either the `dynamictype` keyword and dropping the `self` prefix requirement or using a freestanding `dynamicType()` call. <br></p><p>We have one keyword left in the language, dynamicType, which is camel cased.

This leaves two remaining outliers (`willSet` and `didSet`).

This proposal renames it to Self instead.<br></p><p>In a static function today, self.dynamicType will give you a metatype but the non-member Self will not. The most useful reason to reference it is to call an initializer. It makes accessing the metatype weirder. It’s not Self.Type; that’s a type — you have to spell it Self.type.<br></p><p>Quiz time! What do each of the permutations mean?<br></p><p>Self.self<br>self.Self<br>Self.Self<br>self.self<br>The number of capital letters gives you the level of meta-ness. This is very subtle, which is probably not a good thing.<br></p><p>Another approach would be to introduce a new dynamictype keyword that doesn’t need to be accessed as a member of self, and keep Self the way it is.  Self should work in structs as a type alias.<br></p><p>Why don’t we turn this into a standard library function? It’s not something you need so often that the member access is very valuable. Putting it in the standard library as dynamicType(_:) does still allow for that function to be implemented using compiler magic.<br></p><p>func dynamicType&lt;T&gt;(_: T) -&gt; T.Type { }<br>We have a proposal to remove .self on types. One reason .self exists is to avoid the mistake of writing let x = Int — the compiler will give you a weird type error later on in code if the value of x is what we today call Int.self but you meant to call the Int() initializer. Creating a metatype is not a common operation, so doing it explicitly is a good thing.<br></p><p>It’s weird that you can use the metatype directly to construct something or to do member access, but you can’t access it as a bare value.<br></p><p>Coming back to this proposal, if we removed .self why would we want to add .Self?<br></p><p>If you have a variable whose value is a metatype, you also keep its name in lower case. So Self makes a little less sense from that aspect too.<br></p><p>Another perspective is that .dynamicType is just an implicitly synthesized property on all type.<br></p><p>We do have other keywords that follow the dot on types, Int.Type and Fooable.Protocol, so this isn’t the only thing. Those things are magic nested types.<br></p><p>Subjectively, having dynamicType as a member feels weird.<br></p><p>If .self goes away, the four-self example above is simplified, and .Self doesn’t make sense anymore. There’s also the difference that .Self would be a runtime thing.<br></p><p><br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160421/9718b192/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0068: Expanding Swift Self to class members and value types</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>April 24, 2016 at 06:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0068-universal-self.md<br></p><p>I&#39;m not totally clear what&#39;s being proposed here.<br></p><p>Is this valid?<br></p><p>	class Foo {<br>		static func bar() { … }<br>		func baz(other: Foo) {<br>			Self.bar()<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>Is this valid?<br></p><p>	struct Foo {		// note: not class<br>		static func bar() { … }<br>		func baz(other: Foo) {<br>			Self.bar()<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>Is this valid?<br></p><p>	class Foo {<br>		static func bar() { … }<br>		func baz(other: Foo) {<br>			other.Self.bar()	// note: not self<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>Is this valid?<br></p><p>	struct Foo {		// note: not class<br>		static func bar() { … }<br>		func baz(other: Foo) {<br>			other.Self.bar()	// note: not self<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>Can a class have a variable (inside a method) of type Self?
