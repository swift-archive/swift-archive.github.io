Once you understand that then you would need a version of python (cpython or another typed Python version) that you are able to expose to swift (probably using llvm). I believe there are a bunch of projects that expose libraries like .net, c++ to python but I am not familiar with projects going the other way around. <br></p><p>Another way could be to figure out a way to expose the python script to c. (Python to c source to source translation possibly ). Swift is able to import c code but it is not pretty; you would have to build a nice wrapper around it using swift. <br></p><p>Needless to say, I think that is a lot of work that people just won&#39;t do. If I needed a python library in swift, I would just rewrite it in swift. <br></p><p>There are probably other ways. Good luck.   <br></p><p>&gt; On Jul 2, 2016, at 12:17 PM, Muhammad Tahir Vali via swift-dev &lt;swift-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hey everyone,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I lack the experience the rest of the people in this list probably have being an undergraduate student but I would love to participate in this language because I see its potential.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; With that being said, one of the biggest advantages python has is its immersive number of packages that is appealing to anyone that writes scripts.
