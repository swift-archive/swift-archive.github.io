I propose promoting enum cases back to types, and giving them an appropriate parameterisation syntax: Case&lt;Type, Type&gt;.<br></p><p>Suppose, in the future, we add parameters to generic types which may hold a value. By extension, it would make sense to add support for pattern matching, so the following would be possible:<br></p><p><br>struct Example&lt;let T: Int&gt; {} //Placeholder syntax for a value parameter.<br></p><p>let exampleType: Example.Type = Example&lt;5&gt; //No .self needed, as I believe this is soon to be removed.<br></p><p>switch exampleType {<br></p><p>case Example&lt;0...10&gt;: print(&quot;between 0 and 10&quot;)<br></p><p>case let Example&lt;v&gt; where v &gt; 10: print(&quot;greater than ten&quot;)<br></p><p>case let Example&lt;v&gt; where v &lt; 0: print(&quot;negative: \(v)&quot;)<br></p><p>case Example&lt;let v&gt;: print(&quot;other: \(v)&quot;)<br></p><p>}<br></p><p><br>I propose enums could be considered an extension of this idea, and each case is analogous to a nested type with generic parameters. The enum is a specialised construct for this kind of pattern matching; it resembles a metatype of its nested types, hence a variable of type Enum stores a value of Enum.Case.<br></p><p>The proposed syntax for enums would look like this:<br></p><p><br>enum Optional&lt;T&gt; {<br>	case Some&lt;let T&gt;, //Placeholder syntax for a value parameter.<br>	None<br>}<br></p><p><br>This is not a major change from the current syntax for enums, and it eliminates the currently exceptional use of round brackets for stored-value parameterisation from the language, in favour of a syntax consistent with that of type parameterisation.<br></p><p>This proposal has two major syntax changes:<br>Returning to using UpperCamelCase for enum cases, and making them analogous to nested types.<br>Replacement of round brackets, (), in favour of angle brackets, &lt;&gt;, for parameterisation of enum cases.<br>This could be a simple bracket replacement, which could optionally be revised in the future to match future value parameterisation of types, as shown above with the example &lt;let T&gt; syntax.<br>Alternatively, a value-parameterisation syntax could be chosen now, used for enums, and later be extended to types.<br></p><p>Thanks for reading. Thoughts?<br></p><p><br>PS: An alternative value parameterisation I considered when writing this proposal was Type&lt;T = Int&gt; and .Some&lt;=T&gt;, but using ‘let’ seemed more readable, and reflects pattern matching, so I used that for my examples.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160506/889d2cf8/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
