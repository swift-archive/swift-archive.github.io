The purpose of the isUniquelyReferenced checks is to see whether any changes to the properties of the object can be observed from elsewhere in this program. Therefore, I would expect it to return ‘false’ when there are weak (or unowned) references present, i.e. I think the bug is that we don’t consider weak or unowned references to count for this check.<br></p><p>If my understanding of the intended behavior is correct, then it doesn’t make sense to check for a uniquely-referenced object through a weak (or unowned) reference, because if that were the only reference, then the object would have already been deallocated.<br></p><p>The particular technical reason for the check failing is related to the inout, as you say: in order to pass the reference to the function inout, it has to be loaded into a strong reference first. The reason the inout is there at all is because otherwise the check would fail: there would be a reference from outside the function in addition to the one for the argument.<br></p><p>Hope that clears things up, and if you agree with my interpretation about weak and unowned references, please file a bug at bugs.swift.org &lt;http://bugs.swift.org/&gt;!<br>Jordan<br></p><p><br>&gt; On Jun 27, 2016, at 17:14, Tim Vermeulen via swift-users &lt;swift-users at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class EmptyClass {}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; var strongReference = EmptyClass()<br>&gt; weak var weakReference = strongReference<br>&gt; <br>&gt; print(isUniquelyReferencedNonObjC(&amp;strongReference)) // true<br>&gt; print(isUniquelyReferencedNonObjC(&amp;weakReference))   // false<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I expected both print statements to print true.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I realise that this is probably a known limitation of this function.
