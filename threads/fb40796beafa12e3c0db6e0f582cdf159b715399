Having the function&#39;s return type be the very last thing in the header line is has very nice readability benefit, and this proposal takes that away by sandwiching the return type awkwardly in the middle.<br></p><p>IMO the readability is improved because the where clause can be easily placed in a new line. Generic function definitions with where clauses typically are too long for being crammed into one line without having the readability suffer. The proposal allows a much more readable splitting of the definition into several lines. This completely alleviates the problem of separating generic type information or sandwiching the return type, because the where clause in the next line will be near the generic type parameter list again.<br>Taking Jon Shier’s example: <br>The following definition is already too long IMO. The current syntax does not allow nice splitting of the line and readability suffers from the long gap between the function name and its parameter list:<br>    func something&lt;T: Decodable where T == T.DecodedType&gt;(with something: T) -&gt; String<br></p><p>instead of writing a long line with sandwiching problems like that:<br>    func something&lt;T: Decodable&gt;(with something: T) -&gt; String where T == T.DecodedType<br></p><p>I would write:<br>    func something&lt;T: Decodable&gt;(with something: T) -&gt; String <br>        where T == T.DecodedType<br></p><p><br>To recap: I think that readability improves with the proposal for the following reasons:<br>- The gap between the function name and its parameter list is reduced<br>- Definitions with where clauses typically are already too long to readably fit into one line, so they should be split over more than one line. The current syntax does not offer a natural position for a line break (breaking before the where even further increases the gap between the function name and its parameter list and it looks ugly because of the angle brackets being on separate lines.<br></p><p>-Thorsten<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; The admission that some constraints should be allowed inside the angle brackets (conformance constraints) while moving others (associated type constraints) out introduces inconsistency in the language and seems like an incomplete fix.
