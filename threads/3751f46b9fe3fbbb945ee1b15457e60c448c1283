As far as I am aware, the only<br>&gt; compelling argument in favor of an Either type is &quot;because Haskell has<br>&gt; one&quot;, but I believe it&#39;s commonly recognized that Haskell&#39;s Either is<br>&gt; not particularly good. It&#39;s a weird name for results (which Result<br>&gt; covers), and for other cases it&#39;s usually better just to define your own<br>&gt; two-variant enum anyway. Rust provides some evidence in favor of this,<br>&gt; as this was the rationale for why Rust has a Result&lt;T,E&gt; but no Either,<br>&gt; and it turns out there has been no need to add an Either.<br></p><p>I could not agree more.
