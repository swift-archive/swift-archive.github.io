Prior to anyone working on an implementation, we should agree on a design for how you&#39;d do this. While this isn&#39;t at the top of our priority list at the moment, we&#39;d welcome both design contributions and eventual implementation.<br></p><p>If you&#39;d like to put a proposal together for this, please see the Swift evolution process at https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md. We&#39;d be happy to discuss this here as part of your process for putting a proposal together. Some things to think about in this area are:<br></p><p>– How should refs (branches or tags) that aren&#39;t simple version numbers be specified?<br></p><p>– Right now we require you to tag something as a versioned &quot;release&quot;. Should we require that you tag a branch before someone can make a package depend on it? It could be convenient to be able to just depend on a branch, but the meaning of depending on a branch changes over time as more commits come in. Is it harmful to allow packages to depend on something that&#39;s not an identified commit?<br></p><p>	– Note that we have yet to design our security story (https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/PackageManagerCommunityProposal.md#security-and-signing); what we settle on there might require dependencies to be specified as a specific tagged commit, so that it can be signed.<br></p><p>– Should it be possible to override a package&#39;s dependency to use a different branch, without having to modify and commit a change to that package&#39;s Package.swift?<br></p><p>– We may want to design a way for packages to support different versions of the Swift language, as the language continues to change – e.g. a branch of the package for the last released swift vs the current under development swift snapshot. Is supporting dependencies on package branches a part of how we&#39;ll do that?<br></p><p>Thanks,<br></p><p>	- Rick<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
