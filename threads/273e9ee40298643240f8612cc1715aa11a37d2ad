Having functions with a base name of ‘add’ or ‘remove’ makes sense. Also, the array(contentsOf:) is a special case. Array could store other Arrays (Array&lt;Array&lt;T&gt;&gt;), and we needed to disambiguate between appending the stuff in the array vs the array itself.<br></p><p>We decided that this was not the case for URL (although clearly reasonable people could disagree — we made a decision and stuck with it). Therefore: appendingPathComponent instead of appending(pathComponent:).<br></p><p>There is no doubt in my mind that these guidelines leave a lot more flexibility to the API designer than similar guidelines for Objective-C. That is probably best at this point. I think we, as a community, are still evolving the best practices. I hope we can learn new patterns and idioms over time as we write more and more Swift API. The Objective-C guidelines have evolved dramatically from when Objective-C was as young as Swift (think about things like not even declaring a method return type and assuming ‘id’, or extending NSObject for so-called “informal protocols”, or even the relatively recent addition of property syntax).<br></p><p>- Tony<br></p><p>&gt; On Oct 14, 2016, at 7:49 AM, Adrian Zubarev via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I’m still not convinced in some cases.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Take a look at UIViews and its method addSubview.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; open func addSubview(_ view: UIView)<br>&gt; Personally I’d change or write this function like so:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; open func add(subview: UIView)<br>&gt; This reduces unnecessary noise _ view for both the implementation and usage.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; // Implementation<br>&gt; open func add(subview: UIView) {<br>&gt;     // `subview` is descriptive and just fine here<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; // Usage<br>&gt; <br>&gt; self.view.add(subview: someOtherView)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Adrian Zubarev<br>&gt; Sent with Airmail<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Am 14.
