First:<br></p><p>func doNothing() {}<br>func call(_ ptr: UnsafePointer&lt;() -&gt; ()&gt;) {<br>    ptr.pointee()<br>}<br>var x = doNothing<br>call(&amp;x)<br></p><p><br>There&#39;s no crash there.

That’s why you can’t just form a pointer with that bit-pattern and expect it to work.<br></p><p>If you really need something compatible with a C function, you can use the type &#39;@convention(c) () -&gt; Void’ (or whatever). Note the lack of UnsafePointer here—the reference-ness is baked in in Swift. Even then, though, you can’t rely on the function having the same address every time you run the program (at least on macOS), because of address space randomization—the offset at which your code is loaded will be different on each run. There shouldn’t be any need to do this anyway.<br></p><p>(One place we are still weak is in converting between C function references and UnsafeRawPointer—there’s no dedicated API to do this.
