I&#39;m not a huge fan of Javascript, but the consistancy between<br>&gt; function declarations and anonymous functions is something I feel they got<br>&gt; right. JS syntax for everything that receives parameters and possibly<br>&gt; returns a value is entirely consistent.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Some of this is because Javascript doesn&#39;t have to declare types or return<br>&gt; values and it is even loose with arguments and is somewhat confusing (and<br>&gt; dynamic) with “this”. For Swift, which requires knowledge about the<br>&gt; arguments and return values needed by callers, it makes sense to have two<br>&gt; different syntaxes depending on whether or not this knowledge is being<br>&gt; defined by contract or being inferred by context.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And with ES2015 there are now multiple styles, partially to resolve the<br>&gt; issues with capturing “this” and partially because writing “function”<br>&gt; everywhere is visually distracting.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Let&#39;s take the anonymous function style:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; func asyncWithCallback(_ : func (String) -&gt; Bool)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; asyncWithCallback(func (param) {<br>&gt;     return param == &quot;string&quot;<br>&gt; })<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Particularly for someone new to the language is both clearer and shorter<br>&gt; than this, which makes the caller rewrite the return type in the closure:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; func asyncWithCallback(_ : String -&gt; Bool)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; asyncWithCallback {<br>&gt;   (param: String) -&gt; Bool in<br>&gt;   return param == &quot;string&quot;<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Or I could use:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; asyncWithCallback {<br>&gt;     param in<br>&gt;     return param == &quot;string&quot;<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; or even:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; asyncWithCallback { $0 == &quot;string” }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A function defines a name and a contract for use and definition, while<br>&gt; closures are only semantically valid once defined by a context. I can<br>&gt; understand the stylistic desire to have closures declare arguments outside<br>&gt; a block and to be closer to function syntax. However, using “func&quot;<br>&gt; anonymously to indicate a different syntax with a different set of options,<br>&gt; potentially inferred input types, and an inferred existence of output as<br>&gt; well as output type might be equally confusing. Perhaps another keyword<br>&gt; could be used for this purpose.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; However this new keyword would need to work with, and avoid adding visual<br>&gt; distraction to, the “$0 == “string” case above.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It still fits your unwritten rule to be able to compose language features<br>&gt; in Swift, assuming you leave the same syntactic sugar:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; func if (_ control: Bool, _ path: func ()) {<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   if (control) {<br>&gt;<br>&gt;      path()<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; if (a == b) {<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   //LETS DO SOME STUFF<br>&gt;<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You probably realize this but closures and blocks have different control<br>&gt; flow, so for instance the above would absorb/malfunction on returns as well<br>&gt; as attempts to break/continue outer loops.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -DW<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151230/3351381d/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9bfba345bd373f7b8874d58fed6372ff?s=50"></div><header><strong>Closure Syntax</strong> from <string>David Waite</string> &lt;david at alkaline-solutions.com&gt;<p>December 30, 2015 at 07:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; For clarity&#39;s sake, there&#39;s really two syntactic issues that I think would be good to address.

How functions (global and on types) are declared and implemented*<br>*2. How function specifications are indicated as types*<br>*3. How anonymous functions are declared and implemented*<br></p><p>Agreed, so lets flush out the rules a little more and see if we can find a<br>common language for all three, since they&#39;re interconnected. For the sake<br>of clarity, I&#39;m going to refer to closures as blocks, since they&#39;re<br>effectively the same thing. I think we should begin with these three rules:<br></p><p>1. Let&#39;s try to keep precedent for function calls, since blocks are pretty<br>much functions<br>2. A ^ signifies that we are now entering a block context with regards to<br>syntax<br>3. Just as in a lot of the rest of Swift, let&#39;s infer information we can,<br>but optionally allow it to be respecified if it makes the syntax clearer<br></p><p>&gt;From there, I think the solution to your #2 (*How function specifications<br>are indicated as types) *naturally presents itself. This is a normal<br>function declaration:<br></p><p>func funcName(param) -&gt; return_type<br></p><p>A block is effectively a function without a name - an anonymous function.<br>So we remove the name. I also agree with your earlier points that func is<br>inappropriate terminology for what we&#39;re trying to do so we remove that<br>too. Using the ^ rule to signify a block, we get these options, which I<br>think should both be valid:<br></p><p>^(param) -&gt; return_type<br>^((param) -&gt; return_type)<br></p><p>Which I find to be easier to read than the current closure type:<br></p><p>(param) -&gt; return_type<br></p><p>because it shares syntax with tuples up until the -&gt;, the () are optional<br>making the param share syntax with whatever type the param is, and because<br>when nested closure type syntax become particularly nasty to read.<br></p><p>Indeed, I think it gives us the opportunity for one more gain here. We have<br>functions with named parameters because of Swift&#39;s goal of clarity. This<br>gives us the opportunity for blocks to also have named parameters. Which<br>one of these is better?<br></p><p>func fetchHTML(callback: (String, Int) -&gt; Error?)<br></p><p>or<br></p><p>func fetchHTML(callback: ^(url: String, allowedResponseCode: Int) -&gt; Error?)<br></p><p>The named params aren&#39;t enforced when the block is defined, but provides<br>hints for the Swift user who defines the block body. They can rename those<br>params if they want, but it gives them a hint on how those params will be<br>used, and will autocomplete when they go to write the body with those names.<br></p><p>&gt;From there, I think we have the answer to your question #1 as well (*How<br>functions are declared and implemented) *in that aside from using our new<br>block type syntax for their params, they are completely unchanged. However,<br>the new block type syntax makes function declarations easier to read.<br></p><p>As I listed before, we take this, which I find hard to read at a glance:<br></p><p>func makeIncrementer(forIncrement amount: Int) -&gt; () -&gt; Int { ... }<br></p><p>and replace it with something better:<br></p><p>func makeIncrementer(forIncrement amount: Int) -&gt; ^() -&gt; Int { ... }<br></p><p>or, what I feel should be an option with the ^ syntax:<br></p><p>func makeIncrementer(forIncrement amount: Int) -&gt; ^(() -&gt; Int) { ... }<br></p><p>I don&#39;t think you can look at that and tell me it&#39;s not clearer to read.<br></p><p>Your point 3 (*How anonymous functions are declared and implemented) *is a<br>bit trickier to explain, but I think the explanation arises naturally from<br>the three rules.<br></p><p>Let&#39;s start with rule 1, and look at the way we already define an call a<br>function:<br></p><p>func isNumberFour(number: Int) -&gt; Bool {<br>    return number == 4<br>}<br>isNumberFour(4)<br></p><p>Because we already know the param type and the return type, we don&#39;t need<br>to respecify that information when we call the function. Using the same<br>logic we used to come up with the block type syntax - removing &quot;func&quot; and<br>since it has no name, basically using ^ as a signifier - we&#39;re going to be<br>able to reason out exactly what this would look like:<br></p><p>^(number: Int) -&gt; Bool {<br>    return number == 4<br>}<br></p><p>Let&#39;s take the case where a function has a block as a parameter:<br></p><p>func isNumberFour(calculateNumber: ^((Int) -&gt; Int)) -&gt; Bool<br></p><p>How do I call this? If we&#39;re not using rule 3, inferring what we can, we<br>would write out this, which I think should be valid syntax if desired by<br>Swift&#39;s users:<br></p><p>let isFour: Bool = isNumberFour(calculateNumber: ^(number: Int) -&gt; Int {<br>    return number * 2<br>})<br></p><p>But there&#39;s no reason to be that verbose. We have the isNumberFour<br>declaration. Much like we don&#39;t need to specify that isFour is a Bool,<br>Swift should also allow this:<br></p><p>let isFour = isNumberFour(calculateNumber: ^(number) {<br>   return number * 2<br>})<br></p><p>The compiler already knows enough about the block for that to work. We<br>named the Int param for the calculateNumber block, so autocomplete can<br>finish this for us. However, I also think it should be valid to be able to<br>change the name when the block&#39;s body is defined. So this would also be<br>valid:<br></p><p>let isFour = isNumberFour(calculateNumber: ^(amount) {<br>   return amount * 2<br>})<br></p><p>So the rules we follow are pretty simple. When the block&#39;s body is defined,<br>we only require users to specify the data the compiler can&#39;t infer, while<br>having the option to specify the rest. I believe this is exactly what we&#39;re<br>doing already with closures, we&#39;re just moving the part preceding the &quot;in&quot;<br>to the outside of the method and prefixing it with a ^. It makes closures<br>easier to reason about the syntax, and easier to read.<br></p><p>There are a few shorthands that would go with it. Let&#39;s take the var /<br>property case. Without using rule 3, removing syntax we can infer, we get<br>this:<br></p><p>var isNumberFour: ^(number: Int) -&gt; Bool = ^(number: Int) -&gt; Bool {<br>    return number == 4<br>}<br>isNumberFour(4)<br></p><p>But we already know the parameters, return type, and name of the<br>parameters. So following rule 3, we can reduce this to:<br></p><p>var isNumberFour: ^(Int) -&gt; Bool = ^(number) {<br>    return number == 4<br>}<br></p><p>But I would propose we allow this shorthand, since it&#39;s nicer to read:<br></p><p>var isNumberFour: ^(number: Int) -&gt; Bool = {<br>    return number == 4<br>}<br></p><p>As previously said, if there&#39;s no return type specified, we assume void.<br>Also, if there&#39;s no params and returns void, you can bypass the ^() all<br>together. So:<br></p><p>func async(_ callback: ^())<br></p><p>async(^() {<br>  //Do the callback<br>})<br></p><p>could still be written as:<br></p><p>async {<br>  //Do the callback<br>}<br></p><p>Much like closures in current Swift, if we want to use the $0 $1 shorthand,<br>we can also skip the block param piece:<br></p><p>func sort(_ comparator:^((a: Int, b: Int) -&gt; Bool))<br></p><p>sort(^(a, b) {<br>  return a &gt; b<br>})<br></p><p>could be written as:<br></p><p>sort {<br>  return $0 &gt; $1<br>}<br></p><p>And to answer your question, &quot;Would this syntax still support single<br>expression implicit returns, e.g. current Swift,&quot; the answer is still yes:<br></p><p>[1,2,3].map(^(number) {number == 3})<br></p><p>I feel like this syntax feels intuitive, gets rid of the weird &quot;in&quot; syntax,<br>and is closer to the function syntax people are used to. It also makes<br>reading block types easier, particularly when nested.
