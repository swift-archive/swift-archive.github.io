It&#39;s definitely very<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different grammatically from most other API guidelines, but so are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Objective-C&#39;s guidelines.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, but I&#39;d actually argue that the noun-labels in ObjC are what<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; actually provide the context of the non-mutating nature of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; function. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I disagree with that assertion.  The nouns tell you what type is going<br>&gt;&gt; to be returned and what type is being passed, not whether there will be<br>&gt;&gt; mutation to the receiver.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The noun tells you the object that will be worked with.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; `stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet(_:)` - return a string by trimming characters in set<br>&gt;<br>&gt; `trimCharactersInSet(_:)`, `trim(_:)`, and `trimming(_:)` all read:<br>&gt; return myself by trimming characters in set; there is no noun, so it<br>&gt; is implied that it&#39;s the caller of the function.<br></p><p>I disagree. The first two form imperative verb phrases, and do not imply<br>to me that anything will be returned.  Furthermore, I think for anyone<br>who works in a language with mutation it is natural to assume that<br>imperative-verb-phrase methods might mutate the receiver and return<br>nothing.  This is not a new idea; Cocoa already does things this way.<br></p><p>&gt; The first two guidelines already captures this sentiment as well:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   1. &quot;Those without side-effects should read as noun phrases&quot;.<br>&gt;   2. &quot;Those with side-effects should read as imperative verb phrases.&quot;<br></p><p>I know what the guidelines say and what they&#39;re supposed to mean, and I<br>can&#39;t see how they support your point in any way.  Neither “trimming b”<br>nor “a trimming b” is an imperative verb phrase in English.  It is<br>always a noun phrase.<br></p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; I think we are opening ourselves up to the potential of many confusing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; APIs when an -ed/-ing form of a function name is an appropriate<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; candidate with the opposite meaning that the guidelines set out.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The -ed/-ing suffix choice doesn&#39;t seem outright bad, but it does seem<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; to be &quot;death by paper cuts&quot; bad, at least to me. The guidelines are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; already a bit complicated in this area. Also, like others, I find the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -ing suffix to imply a state of work to be done that will be completed<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; later or cover an extended amount of time; mutation has no bearing on<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; the implementation choice here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Side note: the guidelines are also unintentionally narrow: &quot;Use the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; “ed/ing” rule to name the nonmutating counterpart of a mutating<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; method.&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; We should *always* be following this pattern regardless of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; existence of a nonmutating counterpart. Otherwise, if you implement<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; just a non-mutating function for sorting without the counterpart, you<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; need to use a noun-phrase, like `sortBy`. Then if you later add a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; mutating version, you need to rename the `sortBy` to `sorted`. That<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; seems like the wrong outcome of the guidelines.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I think you&#39;re confused: `sortBy(x)`—or more properly, `sort(by:<br>&gt;&gt; x)`—isn&#39;t a noun-phrase; it&#39;s an imperative verb phrase, so it would be<br>&gt;&gt; an ineligible form for a nonmutating method call.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I think you threw out the baby with the bathwater because of a<br>&gt; technicality there. Let&#39;s try again.<br></p><p>OK.<br></p><p>&gt; The stages of an API development process might look like this:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; version 1: &quot;Those without side-effects should read as noun phrases&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; func contentsOf(filter:) -&gt; Self  // returns a copy<br>&gt;<br>&gt; version 2: &quot;Those with side-effects should read as imperative verb phrases&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; func contentsOf(filter:) -&gt; Self  // returns a copy<br>&gt; mutating func filter(by:)         // honestly, I&#39;m not sure where the preposition debate has landed...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; version 3, bug comes in that the API doesn&#39;t meet the guidelines.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; func filtered(by:) -&gt; Self  // returns a copy<br>&gt; mutating func filter(by:)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Unless I&#39;m misunderstanding the guidelines, this is the natural<br>&gt; progression of the API (minus the `by` preposition, which is<br>&gt; irrelevant to this discussion).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In my opinion, the guidelines should not lead us down breaking API<br>&gt; changes as the API evolves. The entire -ed/-ing confuses the entire<br>&gt; section, and requires future knowledge of what the future API will<br>&gt; look like beforehand. This circles back to my first point about the<br>&gt; noun actually serving as more information that the type.<br></p><p>Yes, that&#39;s true.  You have to think ahead about API evolution if you<br>don&#39;t want to break users.  That goes for naming as well as anything<br>else.  If I said, “related APIs should form a distinguishable family,”<br>you probably wouldn&#39;t argue (would you?) but that guideline could lead<br>to exactly the same sequence of events.<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/012bc4c5e7b0c2829fff88611143c108?s=50"></div><header><strong>API Guidelines Update</strong> from <string>David Owens II</string> &lt;david at owensd.io&gt;<p>February 24, 2016 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt;&gt; The noun tells you the object that will be worked with.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; `stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet(_:)` - return a string by trimming characters in set<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; `trimCharactersInSet(_:)`, `trim(_:)`, and `trimming(_:)` all read:<br>&gt;&gt; return myself by trimming characters in set; there is no noun, so it<br>&gt;&gt; is implied that it&#39;s the caller of the function.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I disagree.
