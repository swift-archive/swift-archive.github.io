When replying, please try to keep the proposal link at the top of the message:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Proposal link:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0036-enum-dot.md &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0036-enum-dot.md&gt;<br>&gt; Reply text<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Other replies<br>&gt;  &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution#what-goes-into-a-review-1&gt;What goes into a review?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review through constructive criticism and, eventually, determine the direction of Swift. When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt; Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt; Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt; If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt; How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br>&gt; <br>&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md&gt;<br>&gt; Thank you,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Doug Gregor<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Review Manager<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160405/b8d6d462/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ab486d7597af4cfe0be33a762150848?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0036: Requiring Leading Dot Prefixes for Enum Instance Member Implementations</strong> from <string>Dany St-Amant</string> &lt;dsa.mls at icloud.com&gt;<p>April  5, 2016 at 08:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Le 31 mars 2016 à 23:41, Douglas Gregor via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt; :<br>&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0036-enum-dot.md<br></p><p>Wondering if this fit more in the lexer/in-house coding style bucket.<br>For the supplied example of &quot;badness&quot;, &#39;case heads&#39;, one can also write &#39;case Coins.heads&#39; and with the latest Erica&#39;s pitch, one day &#39;case Self.heads&#39;; are these also going to be disallowed?<br>I have always seen, the leading dot as an opt-in shortcut that the parser allowed us to use when the context/type can be inferred, and as such the usage of leading dot should probably be left to the user.<br></p><p>The problem I see from the example, is not the inconsistency with &#39;case heads&#39; vs &#39;case .tails&#39; (as coding style) but that you can define in the enum:<br></p><p>static let bluenose:Coin = .tails<br></p><p>And then use it  in:<br>var coin:Coin = .bluenose<br>if coin == .bluenose { print(&quot;tails&quot;) }<br></p><p>But not in:<br>switch coin {<br>    case .bluenose: print(&quot;tails&quot;)<br>    default: print(&quot;heads&quot;)<br>}<br></p><p>Dany<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160405/a85119f9/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
