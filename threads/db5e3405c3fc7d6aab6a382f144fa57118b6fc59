Even if some<br>&gt; have IMO strong arguments against it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So we just have to accept all these mapped/sorted, and following the<br>&gt; API Design Guidelines we just *must* to have *flattened* instead of<br>&gt; *flatten*<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Don&#39;t see any possibilities to discuss this.

I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just don’t see the point of even having naming conventions if we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; allow outside influences to force exceptions for IMO fairly weak<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasons; it amounts to the “because everyone else is doing it”<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasoning, but again, it’s not as if someone used to using .map is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going to be suddenly lost and confused when presented with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .mapped() instead.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As someone who has been using `map` for virtually my entire<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programming career, across languages as different as Perl,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Haskell, Ruby, Objective-C (with my own categories) and now Swift,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would be as surprised by a `map` named `mapped` as I would be by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a letter addressed to &quot;Brented&quot;.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The naming exception is simple and principled: When other<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; languages have universally adopted a given name, and there&#39;s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing particularly wrong with that name except that it doesn&#39;t<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; match Swift conventions, don&#39;t fight the trend just to be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different, or just to be self-consistent. People would figure out<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `mapped`, sure, but `map` causes not even a moment of confusion.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you also think that trigonometry should be `foo.sined`,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `foo.cosined`, and `foo.tangented`? Or maybe `foo.sine`,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `foo.cosine`, and `foo.tangent`, with corresponding<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `foo.formSine`, `foo.formCosine`, and `foo.formTangent` functions?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Remember the first and most important sentence in the API<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Guidelines: &quot;Clarity at the point of use is your most important<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; goal.&quot; If there is a universally-accepted nomenclature for a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; particular operation, the clearest thing we can do is to adopt it,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; even if it doesn&#39;t match our normal guidelines.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Consistency is a powerful and satisfying goal, but we must be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; careful not to be seduced by it. &quot;A foolish consistency is the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hobgoblin of little minds.&quot; When there is a compelling reason to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deviate from the guidelines, we should be prepared to do so.*<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Consistency in API naming is a means to convey semantics, not an end in itself. We must not let the cart be put before the horse.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Besides, since they take arguments, we should favor `mapping`,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `filtering`, `flatMapping`, etc. Or perhaps even<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `mappingFlattened` for the last one. Can you see the rabbit hole<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we&#39;re beginning to tumble down?)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Well, as the people writing the guidelines, we should try to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; modify the guidelines to write a general rule accommodating the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deviation, because any situation we encounter is likely to be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; encountered by others as well. We&#39;ve done that in this case by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; writing the &quot;term of art&quot; rule.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brent Royal-Gordon<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Architechies<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a0b362cd96d9f85beab1079ff37e3d19?s=50"></div><header><strong>[SR-933] Rename flatten to flattened</strong> from <string>Vladimir.S</string> &lt;svabox at gmail.com&gt;<p>April 20, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>Dave, could you clarify your message with more details please.<br>Are you saying that &quot;map&quot; will be &quot;map&quot; in Swift 3.0 and that &quot;flatten&quot; is <br>the same kind of special case when we don&#39;t need to rename it?<br></p><p>Just checked.
