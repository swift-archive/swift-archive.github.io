For example, say I<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; laid an array of Ints, organised into groups of five (and also that I’m<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; lunatic who won’t use a tuple for this), the stride of this array is 5<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; whether I’m stepping through it forwards or backwards. Imagine I defined<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; this like so (more realistically it’d be a struct or a class):<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; typealias StridedIntegerArray:(stride:Int, array:[Int])<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; If the stride is set to 5, it’s always 5, the only thing that changes is<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; whether I want to stride from the start or end of the array, plus I could<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; things like:<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; myStridedIntegerArray.prefix(from: 2).striding(forwardBy:<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; myStridedIntegerArray.stride) // Returns element at index 2, 7, 12, etc.<br>&gt;     &gt;<br>&gt;     &gt; When you have a sequence returning elements at index 12, 7, 2, etc.,<br>&gt;     &gt; wouldn&#39;t you call the stride size -5? I would, because 12 + (-5) = 7.<br>&gt;     &gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; It just occurred to me that perhaps you intended this method only for<br>&gt;     ranges<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; specifically and that perhaps I’m confusing things, but it seems to me<br>&gt;     like<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; it should be a method for all sequences (with reverse stride available on<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; collections with a reverse index type) returning a generator that only<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; returns (or computes) every Nth element, for generic<br>&gt;     sequences/collections<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; this would take the start or end index and use advanced(by:), though<br>&gt;     again,<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; I kind of feel like that should be two separate methods as well, but<br>&gt;     that’s<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; for another issue I think.<br>&gt;     &gt;<br>&gt;     &gt; I don&#39;t think it should be for ranges only, but ranges are the extent<br>&gt;     &gt; of this proposal.<br>&gt;     &gt;<br>&gt;     &gt; That said, my own opinion is that striding should not be available on<br>&gt;     &gt; sequences but on collections only. In their most commonly used form,<br>&gt;     &gt; integer strides take a start and end, and there is a finite number of<br>&gt;     &gt; things to stride over; thus, in my reasoning, strides can be extended<br>&gt;     &gt; to cover anything else that has a known start and end and has a finite<br>&gt;     &gt; number of things, which is guaranteed by conformance to Collection but<br>&gt;     &gt; not to Sequence.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     I dunno; it seems to me that if someone gives me a Sequence I should be<br>&gt;     able to traverse it, skipping every other element. I don&#39;t see why<br>&gt;     “stride” should be inapplicable here.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt; (At the moment, StrideTo/Through conforms to Sequence and not to<br>&gt;     &gt; Collection, but that is considered something to be fixed and we will<br>&gt;     &gt; see if we can address that as part of this set of stride overhauls.)<br>&gt;     &gt;<br>&gt;     &gt; As I see it, we agree on the problem: the current algorithm cannot<br>&gt;     &gt; accommodate singly linked lists and sequences because those things do<br>&gt;     &gt; not have a known endpoint if you begin an attempt to stride. However,<br>&gt;     &gt; my conclusion is the opposite of yours: namely, that they should not<br>&gt;     &gt; have stride. Maybe they should have something similar, but it<br>&gt;     &gt; shouldn&#39;t be stride.<br>&gt;     &gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; On Sun, Apr 10, 2016 at 12:53 PM Haravikk via swift-evolution<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt; &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; On 10 Apr 2016, at 11:17, Brent Royal-Gordon<br>&gt;     &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; Why not just assign it the correct sign during the init function?<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; (0 ... 6).striding(by: 2) // [0, 2, 4, 6], end &gt; start, so stride = by<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; (6 ... 0).striding(by: 2) // [6, 4, 2, 0], start &gt; end, so stride = -by<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; One reason not to do it this way is that, if we extend `striding(by:)`<br>&gt;     to<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; other collections, they will not be as easy to walk backwards through as<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; this. You will have to do something like<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; `collection.reversed().striding(by:)` which will be a hassle.<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; Any thoughts on the alternative I mentioned a little earlier to define<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; overloads instead of positive/negative? i.e- you would have two methods,<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; .striding(forwardBy:) and .striding(backwardBy:). In addition to<br>&gt;     eliminating<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; the use of a negative stride to indicate direction, this has the<br>&gt;     advantage<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; that .striding(backwardBy:) can be defined only for types with a<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; ReverseIndex or only for collections (as you can stride through a<br>&gt;     sequence,<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; but only by going forward).<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; This should also make documentation a bit clearer, otherwise you’ve got<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; the caveat that to go backwards requires a negative value, but only if<br>&gt;     the<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; type supports that, which a developer would then need to check. Instead<br>&gt;     it<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; either has the backwardBy variant or not.<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; I know that advance(by:) supports negative values, but this is actually<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; something I wouldn’t mind seeing changed as well, as it has the same<br>&gt;     issues<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; (passing a negative value in looks fine until you realise the type is a<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; ForwardIndex only). It would also allow us to define Distance types that<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; don’t support a direction, since this would be given by the choice of<br>&gt;     method<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; called instead.<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; Of course I’d still like to be able to define 6 … 0 or whatever, but<br>&gt;     this<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; would at least eliminate what I dislike about using negatives for<br>&gt;     direction.<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;     &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     --<br>&gt;     Dave<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/60dcb74d816e29b2aa6b9c0b5969670e?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Draft]: Introducing a striding(by:) method on 3.0 ranges</strong> from <string>Xiaodi Wu</string> &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;<p>April 11, 2016 at 09:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Fair enough.

Maybe they should have something similar, but it<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; shouldn&#39;t be stride.<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt; On Sun, Apr 10, 2016 at 12:53 PM Haravikk via swift-evolution<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt; &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; On 10 Apr 2016, at 11:17, Brent Royal-Gordon<br>&gt; &gt;     &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; Why not just assign it the correct sign during the init function?<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; (0 ... 6).striding(by: 2) // [0, 2, 4, 6], end &gt; start, so<br>&gt; stride = by<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; (6 ... 0).striding(by: 2) // [6, 4, 2, 0], start &gt; end, so<br>&gt; stride = -by<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; One reason not to do it this way is that, if we extend<br>&gt; `striding(by:)`<br>&gt; &gt;     to<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; other collections, they will not be as easy to walk backwards<br>&gt; through as<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; this. You will have to do something like<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; `collection.reversed().striding(by:)` which will be a hassle.<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; Any thoughts on the alternative I mentioned a little earlier to<br>&gt; define<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; overloads instead of positive/negative? i.e- you would have two<br>&gt; methods,<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; .striding(forwardBy:) and .striding(backwardBy:). In addition to<br>&gt; &gt;     eliminating<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; the use of a negative stride to indicate direction, this has the<br>&gt; &gt;     advantage<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; that .striding(backwardBy:) can be defined only for types with a<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; ReverseIndex or only for collections (as you can stride through a<br>&gt; &gt;     sequence,<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; but only by going forward).<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; This should also make documentation a bit clearer, otherwise<br>&gt; you’ve got<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; the caveat that to go backwards requires a negative value, but<br>&gt; only if<br>&gt; &gt;     the<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; type supports that, which a developer would then need to check.<br>&gt; Instead<br>&gt; &gt;     it<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; either has the backwardBy variant or not.<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; I know that advance(by:) supports negative values, but this is<br>&gt; actually<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; something I wouldn’t mind seeing changed as well, as it has the<br>&gt; same<br>&gt; &gt;     issues<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; (passing a negative value in looks fine until you realise the<br>&gt; type is a<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; ForwardIndex only). It would also allow us to define Distance<br>&gt; types that<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; don’t support a direction, since this would be given by the<br>&gt; choice of<br>&gt; &gt;     method<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; called instead.<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; Of course I’d still like to be able to define 6 … 0 or whatever,<br>&gt; but<br>&gt; &gt;     this<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; would at least eliminate what I dislike about using negatives for<br>&gt; &gt;     direction.<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     --<br>&gt; &gt;     Dave<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; &gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; &gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; --<br>&gt; Dave<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160411/ed55fbf9/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
