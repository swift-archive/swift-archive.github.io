Then, to make the overall syntax consistent, to do the same for single-line strings. In either case, quotes of any kind other than a triple quote would not need to be escaped in a multi-line string literal. So:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; let foo = &quot;&quot;&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;   hell yeah, escapes! \n\n<br>&gt;&gt;   \(sound) like a &quot;\(animal)&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;   this is another completely random line<br>&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Would have a foo variable containing (note the stripped indentation, as that seems to be the popular request in this thread):<br>&gt;&gt; hell yeah, escapes!<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; moo like a &quot;cow&quot;<br>&gt;&gt; this is another completely random line<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; But if wrapped by &#39;&#39;&#39; then none of the interpolation or escape processing happens (and quotes still don&#39;t need to be escaped).<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Come to think of it, I don&#39;t see why a &#39;&#39;&#39; syntax would -have- to be multi-line.
