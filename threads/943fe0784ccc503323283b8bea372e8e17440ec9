The proposal is<br>available here:<br></p><p>	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0061-autoreleasepool-signature.md<br></p><p>Reviews are an important part of the Swift evolution process. All<br>reviews should be sent to the swift-evolution mailing list at<br></p><p>	https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>or, if you would like to keep your feedback private, directly to the<br>review manager.<br></p><p>What goes into a review?<br></p><p>The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review<br>through constructive criticism and, eventually, determine the<br>direction of Swift. When writing your review, here are some questions<br>you might want to answer in your review:<br></p><p>	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a<br>          change to Swift?<br></p><p>	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of<br>          Swift?<br></p><p>	* If you have you used other languages or libraries with a<br>          similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares<br>          to those?<br></p><p>	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a<br>          quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br></p><p>	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br></p><p>Thank you,<br></p><p>-Dave Abrahams<br>Review Manager<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e9f543f0ffdb7c9a899e628fe76e7f3?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0061: Add Generic Result and Error Handling to autoreleasepool()</strong> from <string>Jacob Bandes-Storch</string> &lt;jtbandes at gmail.com&gt;<p>April 22, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         * What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt;<br></p><p>+1.

It doesn&#39;t create any incompatibilities. Old code will behave the same as before. autoreleasepool works more like @autoreleasepool from Objective-C now.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a<br>&gt;          change to Swift?<br></p><p>The problem is not very big, but since the change doesn&#39;t introduce any incompatibilities, I&#39;d say: Yes<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of<br>&gt;          Swift?<br></p><p>I think so.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; 	* If you have you used other languages or libraries with a<br>&gt;          similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares<br>&gt;          to those?<br></p><p>Well, Objective-C has the @autoreleasepool. I think the only reason why it is available in Swift too, is because Swift is normally used on top of the Objective-C runtime. Swift&#39;s autoreleasepool will behave more like the original @autoreleasepool if this proposal is implemented. Implementing the proposal feels more like a bugfix to me.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a<br>&gt;          quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>I read the proposal.<br></p><p>-Michael<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
