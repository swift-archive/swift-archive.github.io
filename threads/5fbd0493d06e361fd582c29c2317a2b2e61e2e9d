The main annoyance is that the best solution (currently) seems to be to copy the source code and make a change.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; (cc-ing Jordan Rose because of a related swift-users thread) This might be a bit of a stretch, but can’t Swift upcast sequences to AnySequence implicitly, like is done with AnyHashable? That would make `first.map { sequence(first: $0, next: next } ?? []` instantly valid, I think. There’s also something to be said for consistency between type erasers.

One downside is that the `ExpressibleByArrayLiteral` protocol allows creating non-empty sequences as well, which does not make sense for the `UnfoldSequence`.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Max<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Aug 19, 2016, at 3:48 PM, Tim Vermeulen via swift-evolution&lt;swift-evolution at swift.org(mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org)&gt;wrote:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On 19 Aug 2016, at 19:48, Kevin Ballard&lt;kevin at sb.org(mailto:kevin at sb.org)&gt;wrote:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AFAIK this issue has never been discussed with sequence(first:next:) before. It certainly wasn&#39;t brought up during review.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for my opinion, I&#39;m really not sure. I was going to point out that right now sequence(first:next:) guarantees that the first element of the resulting sequence is the value provided as &quot;first&quot;, but it occurs to me that if you treat the nil result from next() as an element, then this still holds true. So I guess my biggest worry is this change will make it harder to use sequence(first:next:) to produce sequences of optional values.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don’t think producing sequences of optional values would really be a problem, because type inference will figure this out based on whether you treat the argument to the `next` closure as an optional or not. And if you only do things in `next` that work both with optionals and non-optionals (very unlikely), you can always manually specify the type of the sequence.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So I guess I&#39;m ambivalent, and would prefer to defer to the wisdom of the Swift core team on this matter.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That said, didn&#39;t the deadline for source-breaking changes already come and go?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Kevin Ballard<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Fri, Aug 19, 2016, at 10:37 AM, Max Moiseev wrote:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; + Erica, Kevin, as the authors of the original proposal.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you remember the problem of non-emptiness being discussed before?

The same goes for something like `sequence(first: 5, next: { $0 * 3 }).first(where: { $0&gt;1000 })`, because the sequence is infinite, which means `first(while:)` will either keep running forever, or return a non-optional.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ideally, we’d have three types of sequences, with three corresponding `sequence(first:next:)` functions:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; func sequence&lt;T&gt;(first: T?, next: (T) -&gt;T?)—returns any sequence<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; func sequence&lt;T&gt;(first: T,next: (T) -&gt;T?)—returns a nonempty sequence<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; func sequence&lt;T&gt;(first: T,next: (T) -&gt;T)—returns an infinite sequence<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Default implementations for methods on sequences would either return optionals or non-optionals depending on their emptiness/finiteness. We just have the first kind of sequence right now, so in that regard it would make sense to also give `sequence(first:next)` the corresponding signature.Later, when the language / standard library supports the other two kinds of sequences (if that ever happens), the other versions could be added.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another reason that makes me think that the version that accepts an optional `first` argument is more natural, is the fact that the function body doesn’t need to be changed at all. It supports optional seeds by design; only the signature prevents it.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know these arguments might not be very convincing, but I feel like Swift misses an opportunity if it unnecessarily constrains the `first` parameter to be non-optional. The `.lazy.flatMap({ $0 })` alternative that you pointed out does work, but it makes everything very unreadable: not just the `.lazy.flatMap({ $0 })` part, but also the body of the `next` parameter because you’re now dealing with optionals (i.e. you have to `flatMap` over the closure argument). The best solution I’ve come up with is to copy the `sequence(first:next)` implementation from the source code and change the signature. :-/<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; `sequence(state:next:)` isn’t very appropriate for this task either, because naive usage with an optional seed has the downside of being unnecessarily eager just like a naive `sequence(first:next)` implementation (as described in a comment in the source code).<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On 19 Aug 2016, at 00:18, Max Moiseev&lt;moiseev at apple.com(mailto:moiseev at apple.com)&gt;wrote:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Tim,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for bringing this up.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here are my thoughts on the change you’re proposing.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; func sequence&lt;T&gt;(first: T, next: (T) -&gt;T?) -&gt;UnfoldFirstSequence&lt;T&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To me the type of the function as it is tells a clear story of what’s going to happen: take the `first`, make it a head of the resulting sequence, and then try to produce the tail by a series of applications of `next`. The only thing that controls when the sequence generation terminates is the result of `next`.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If we change the type of `first` to an Optional&lt;T&gt;, it would make the termination condition non-trivial. After all, the only thing it would do is try to unwrap the `first`, before doing what it needs to, but we already have a `map` for that. One should be able to simply do the `first.map { sequence(first: $0, next: next) } ?? []` but that won’t work with the types very well, unfortunately.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an alternative, `let first: Int? = ...; sequence(first: first, next: next).flatMap({$0})` (or even `.lazy.flatMap({$0})`) will do the right thing without making an API more complex.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I see the point of `sequence(first:next:)` to be precisely the &quot;generate the non-empty sequence using a seed and a simple producer&quot;, for anything more than that, there is `sequence(state:next:)`.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Max<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Aug 14, 2016, at 4:27 PM, Tim Vermeulen via swift-evolution&lt;swift-evolution at swift.org(mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org)&gt;wrote:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sequence(first:next:) takes a non-optional first argument.
