The proposal was not explicit about the fact that the protocols were going to change, and in fact it turned out that changing them was not a good idea.  We&#39;ve already applied the effects of this amendment in trunk, but that is a decision that should be ratified by the community.  Please do not allow the fact that it&#39;s &quot;already done&quot; to discourage you from speaking up if you have strong feelings about this amendment.<br></p><p>The adjusted proposal fully specifies the &quot;changes&quot; to the object literal protocols.  I&#39;ve put &quot;changes&quot; in quotes because, in fact, the result is no net change to the _ColorLiteralConvertible protocol vs. prior releases of Swift, and the other two protocols have been changed only to add &quot;ResourceName&quot; as a suffix to the argument label.  Adding this to the label is more explicit and may be useful if we choose to embellish these protocols in the future; it also creates a simple algorithm for deriving the initializer name from the name of the protocol and the argument labels in the literal.<br></p><p>These protocols are currently underscored and therefore are not intended to be implemented outside of the Swift repository, which is why I did not initially push this through review.<br></p><p>We view this as a minor amendment to the proposal.  The fast-track process for such amendments is to just open a pull request against the swift-evolution repository, which I&#39;ve done and linked above.  Any necessary discussion should occur on that PR.  The core team will accept the PR after a reasonable amount of time unless there are strong objections; if there are, we will close the PR and start the ordinary evolution process.<br></p><p>John.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/attachments/20160516/5d44be23/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
