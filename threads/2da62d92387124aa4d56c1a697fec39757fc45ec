Additionally, the \ is very visually distinctive in a string, much moreso than the &quot;traditional&quot; $ variable marker. Almost every language I’ve seen using $ for interpolation in strings is doing so because it also uses it as a variable prefix in non-string contexts. To top it off, using $ instead would, for me, just add yet another language for which I have to remember &quot;does the $ go inside or outside the name delimiter braces/brackets/whatever?&quot;, &quot;is it parenthesis, braces, brackets, or some other delimiter for variable names?&quot;, &quot;what kind of expressions can I use in this context?&quot;, &quot;can I use interpolation without any delimiters for simple cases?&quot;, etc. See also PHP, Perl, ten flavors of shell scripts, JavaScript, JSP/ASP, XPath, and so forth. The \() syntax is unique to Swift and therefore very easy to remember.<br></p><p>I also don’t see that Swift carries an expectation of being able to use a syntax which is traditionally confined to interpreted/scripting languages, and even there $ is by no means ubiquitous. Here are just a few counterexamples among various languages:<br></p><p>- C (printf formats)<br>- C++ (stream modifiers)<br>- Objective-C (NSString formats)<br>- C# ($, but with the unusual syntax $&quot;blah {foo} blah&quot;)<br>- Lua (printf formats and language hacks)<br>- Python (printf formats with trailing &quot;% (tuple)&quot; syntax)<br>- Ruby (&quot;#{}&quot;)<br>- Java (printf formats)<br></p><p>There’s an obvious pattern in these example, which brings to something I _would_ like to see for string interpolation in Swift: Better control over the precise representation of the data. I’m sure the topic has been done to death many times before, but I haven’t found any solid information at a quick search, so I apologize if this is all old hat.<br></p><p>Anyway - Creating, configuring, and invoking various Formatter types in order to present data in the proper fashion is an option, and a preferable one when the data is intended for user consumption (especially to get the maximum support from localization). But for logging, debugging, parsing of textual formats, writing textual formats, etc., I almost always want a traditional C/POSIX/ISO representation as easily provided by printf()-style specifiers. 99% of the time when I want to do an number-to-string (integer or otherwise) conversion especially, I’m being specific about the appearance of the number.<br></p><p>For example, for a hex representation of sockaddr_in.sin_addr.s_addr, I would in other languages write &quot;printf(&quot;0x%08x&quot;, address.sin_addr.s_addr);&quot;, or &quot;%02hhu&quot; times four to get dotted-decimal notation. (Ignoring for the moment the existence of inet_ntop() for the sake of the example :). In Swift, I currently have to make a call to printf(), fprintf(), dprintf(), NSString(format:), asprintf() (with a wrapper to deal with getting a Swift.String from allocated memory), etc. A configured NumberFormatter instance is a great deal more code - even NumberFormatter.localizedString(from: foo, number: .decimal) is very verbose, and that *still* doesn’t yield the same level of format control!).<br></p><p>And to top it off, these still carry the traditional problem of printf() formats - separation between the format specifier and the data that format applies to. I’m sure most of us have at one time or another written a printf() with enough arguments that it was easy to lose track of them and end up being very grateful for the existence of -Werror=format (and frustrated that __attribute__((format(..))) is as limited as it is :).<br></p><p>I’m not sure exactly what form support for formatted data in interpolated strings would take in Swift, but it’s certainly one of the things I find myself actively missing on a regular basis, and I do have some ideas on how to go about it, if it isn’t already under discussion/development.<br></p><p>-- Gwynne Raskind<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160621/68b5637a/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d4fb9162c777a5d6d0b1fb00893d709?s=50"></div><header><strong>Thoughts on replacing \() with $() or some other symbol</strong> from <string>Haravikk</string> &lt;swift-evolution at haravikk.me&gt;<p>June 21, 2016 at 11:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On 21 Jun 2016, at 22:49, Gwynne Raskind via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jun 21, 2016, at 15:48, Jonathan Cotton via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I&#39;d support $() as is in use by other languages, including Kotlin, as mentioned it seems less disruptive and more inline with the tokenised parameters that are already supported in closures.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On 21 Jun 2016, at 21:43, Kenny Wyland via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi all,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m new to the list and I just searched through the archives as best I could to see if someone else had already brought this up, but I didn&#39;t find anything.
