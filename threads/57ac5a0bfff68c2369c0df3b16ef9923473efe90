That implies that the tag is placed at the end of the data, because putting a 1-byte field at the beginning would require 7 extra bytes of padding before the first Int. But the stride still needs to be 48 bytes to preserve the 8-byte-alignment of subsequent values.<br></p><p>This implies that you might be able to make an enum use up to 7 fewer bytes in practice, if you can make its largest case be one byte smaller than a multiple of a power of 2. Obviously not always attainable, but if you’re really groveling for space improvements you might be able to squeeze out that extra byte.<br></p><p>—Jens<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20160405/dd9b29f6/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/06c1dcc7dce6a93d194b9c013376e3f0?s=50"></div><header><strong>Memory used by enums</strong> from <string>Joe Groff</string> &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt;<p>April  5, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Apr 4, 2016, at 4:57 PM, Jonathan Hull via swift-users &lt;swift-users at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I had a quick question on the memory used by enums with associated values in the current implementation.

You can mark your large, rare cases `indirect`, which will make the inline storage pointer-width, referencing a separate allocation:<br></p><p>enum MyEnum {<br>	case mostCommonlyUsed<br>	case somewhatCommon (Int,Int)<br>	indirect case prettyRare (Int,Int,Int,Int,Int)<br>}<br></p><p>-Joe<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
