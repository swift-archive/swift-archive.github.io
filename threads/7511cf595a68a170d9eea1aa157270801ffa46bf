If there is some small chance that this can still be changed, it would save us all a nasty case of carpal-tunnel syndrome from typing this unnecessary construction all the way from now to eternity. “fileURLWithPath:” is extremely verbose and redundant for something that is used so often, and it&#39;s the one thing that I’ve always hated about the URL-based file APIs. I’m kicking myself for not thinking to request this earlier, but better late than never, I suppose.<br></p><p>Charles<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160805/aafe9ee1/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>Pitch: URL(fileURLWithPath:) to URL(filePath:)</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>August  5, 2016 at 09:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Aug 5, 2016, at 5:32 PM, Erica Sadun via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; There are many, many of these and it would be great to find out how to request them.

We’ll have some limited ability to do source breaking changes in Swift 4, but we need to figure out how the mitigation strategy will work (in full detail) so we know exactly what sort of changes will work.<br></p><p>-Chris<br></p><p><br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- E<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Aug 5, 2016, at 4:29 PM, Charles Srstka via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Late, I know, but since it’s a simple search-and-replace change, I wonder if the team might consider renaming URL(fileURLWithPath:), which is quite verbose, to URL(filePath:), which conveys the same information while being much less painful to type.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Charles<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
