I think I have discovered a truly marvelous solution a way of addressing it:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; `signBitIndex` is only used (I’m talking about the prototype now) to determine the absolute required minimum of bits needed to represent the current value of number when converting it to a different type.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; So, instead of mentioning the sign bit, let’s call it what it is ‘minimumRequiredWidth’ or something along this line. This move will also allow the default implementation of `minimumRequiredWidth` to simply return `bitWidth` for unsigned numbers and and `bitWidth - 1` for positive signed, etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This way bignum implementations don’t have to have any specific underlying representation. They can either inherit the default implementation or implement their own version of `minimumRequiredWidth` in case the `bitWidth` has some extra unused space that is not absolutely required.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I still need to validate this idea, these are just the thoughts.

It won’t truncate and we considered it to be a sufficient difference in behavior to not allow it to be used in the context over all integers.<br></p><p>Hm. I guess that makes sense. My interpretation: the behavior on fixed-width integers is well-understood, the behavior on arbitrary-precision integers is easy to understand, but the behavior in an algorithm generic over both might be problematic. Thanks for the explanation.<br></p><p><br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; - Is there a requirement about left-shifting into the sign bit, for &#39;&lt;&lt;&#39; and for &#39;&amp;&lt;&lt;‘?<br>&gt; The current behavior is to not do anything special about the sign bit. So that (64 as Int8) &lt;&lt; 1 would result in a -128.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I should probably add a general note somewhere in the proposal that “unless specifically mentioned, the behavior will remain consistent with the existing implementation”.<br></p><p>Sure. In this case I was asking about the requirement, though. If I use something like llvm::APSInt, which has an arbitrary-but-fixed-at-creation number of words, does shifting into the sign bit of a signed integer always result in a negative number? It never traps or is assumed not to happen?<br></p><p><br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; - What is the ArithmeticOverflow type?<br>&gt; It is an enum with 2 cases, just like Optional&lt;()&gt;, but with more specific case name. If not for the explicitness, a simple Bool value could have been used.<br></p><p>Please do include this in the proposal. :-)<br></p><p><br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; - When does the remainder operation overflow? (I just can&#39;t remember.)<br>&gt; Discussed in a separate email. The only case where it should trap is ‘division by zero’, so this part is subjected to changes.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; - I feel a little weird having &quot;someValue.and(mask)&quot;. Maybe bitwiseAnd or bitwiseAND to be more explicit?<br>&gt; Doesn’t return type hint at the ‘bitwise&#39; and not logical nature of these operations? Besides, I would expect operators to be used instead of actual protocol functions.<br></p><p>I guess so. It just reads oddly to me.<br></p><p><br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; - maskingShiftLeft/Right seem underspecified in their doc comments. Why can&#39;t the protocol requirement just assume the shift amount has already been masked, instead of performing the masking themselves? Is it because we won&#39;t be able to optimize that away?<br>&gt; There is a section about shifts: https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0104-improved-integers.md#a-note-on-bit-shifts &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0104-improved-integers.md#a-note-on-bit-shifts&gt;<br>&gt; Let me know if you think it is insufficient.<br></p><p>I did see this section, but that&#39;s about the operator-based interface, not the requirements on a model type. I&#39;d like to hear a little more about what the expected input range of maskingShiftLeft is and why.<br></p><p>Jordan<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160623/c09e187f/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0735d3bf1d76c0385258ac7a2a22d6fe?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0104: Protocol-oriented integers</strong> from <string>Károly Lőrentey</string> &lt;karoly at lorentey.hu&gt;<p>June 24, 2016 at 07:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; * What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>+1 in general<br>&gt; * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>Yes.<br>&gt; * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>Yes, with some nitpicks detailed below.<br>&gt; * If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>-<br>&gt; * How much effort did you put into your review?

Can we prevent having to answer this question by e.g. moving this method down to UnsignedInteger? Big integer libs often use a signed magnitude representation; having to e.g. convert it to two’s complement on the fly to satisfy the API would be weird. (Also, the name `nthWord` seems unswifty to me.)<br></p><p>Like others on this list, I also find signBitIndex confusing. The name does not make much sense for unsigned integers, or signed integers that do not use an embedded sign bit. Is it supposed to return the width (in bits) of the binary representation of the integer’s absolute value? (Why -1 for zero, then? What’s the signBitIndex for 1?) <br></p><p>I can’t find any mention of the unary bitwise not (~) operation. It should be in FixedWidthInteger, right?<br></p><p>Binary bitwise operations (or/and/xor) are in FixedWidthInteger, but I believe they can be implemented on big integers in a way that is perfectly consistent with fixed width integers. Admittedly, I don’t know of any generic algorithms that want these.<br></p><p>To support big integers better, I think IntegerLiteralConvertible should also be updated at some point to work in terms of machine words. (Having to implement StringLiteralConvertible to provide source-level support for huge numbers works, but it isn’t great.)<br></p><p>I can see myself typing foo.absoluteValue instead of abs(foo) all the time; if its use is to be discouraged, perhaps a less prominent name would be better.<br></p><p>There is a typo in the Operators section: “Arithmetic” should read “Integer” in these two lines:<br></p><p>	public func % &lt;T: Arithmetic&gt;(lhs: T, rhs: T) -&gt; T<br>	public func %= &lt;T: Arithmetic&gt;(lhs: inout T, rhs: T)<br></p><p>Remark: The gyb is nice when used in moderation, but I find parts of the prototype overuse templating to a point that’s bordering on obfuscation.
