The ability to work around its lack doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t have value, and the fact that the simplest workaround is not the best one is I think a good reason to make the easiest solution into the best one (by providing .indexed()). Add to that the fact that a lot of people probably use .enumerated() to produce indexes when working with arrays, and this is a pitfall when working with other types, such as ArraySlice which still has Int indexes but is no longer zero-based.<br></p><p>-Kevin Ballard<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
