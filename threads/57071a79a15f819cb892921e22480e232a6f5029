Why complicate the naming of value type members with the complexities of reference semantics? The current API naming conventions are good for reference types which sometimes come with unobvious to obscure behaviour (i.e. anything from bumping an internal counter to firing missiles and wiping hard drives).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; But value types ought to have no side effects (besides memory allocation and logging maybe), and so we don&#39;t necessarily need that strong a naming convention to limit their collateral damage.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If the `mutate` keyword became required for calling `mutating` methods, then operators would remain the only place where naming convention were needed to distinguish mutation:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Mutating assignment is explicit: `xs = [1, 2] + xs + [2, 1]` (i.e. `=` without `let` or `var` means mutation)<br>&gt; Mutating method call becomes explicit: `mutate xs.sort()` and `let x = mutate xs.removeAtIndex(2)`<br>&gt; Mutating function arguments are explicit with the `&amp;` prefix: `swap(&amp;xs, &amp;ys)`<br>&gt; Mutating operators are implicit and by convention, should end with the `=` symbol: `xs += [8, 9]`<br>&gt; Reference types have no notion of `mutating` members (and probably ought to remain that way) so they mutate implicitly.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I should also point out that under the assignment method paradigm one<br>&gt;&gt; would probably need to re-evalutate rules for naming.  Under the current<br>&gt;&gt; API guidelines&#39; approach, we&#39;d write:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;    x.=sorted()      // sort x in-place<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; and I am not sure how easy that would be for people to swallow<br>&gt;&gt; considering how much more straightforward<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;    x.sort()         // current way to sort x in-place<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; is, and because the language now contains explicit notation for<br>&gt;&gt; mutation, it becomes harder to argue against theis pair:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;    y = x.sort()<br>&gt;&gt;    x.=sort()      // sort x in place<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I agree that the current API guidelines wouldn&#39;t work for value types anymore. Both `sort` and `sorted` would be called `sort`.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Lastly, I should point out that the proposal does nothing to solve the<br>&gt;&gt; problem of `c.formSuccessor(&amp;i)`, since that doesn&#39;t mutate the<br>&gt;&gt; receiver.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This proposal does address the problem of `c.formSuccessor(&amp;i)`.

The current API naming conventions are good for reference types which sometimes come with unobvious to obscure behaviour (i.e. anything from bumping an internal counter to firing missiles and wiping hard drives).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; But value types ought to have no side effects (besides memory allocation and logging maybe), and so we don&#39;t necessarily need that strong a naming convention to limit their collateral damage.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If the `mutate` keyword became required for calling `mutating` methods, then operators would remain the only place where naming convention were needed to distinguish mutation:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Mutating assignment is explicit: `xs = [1, 2] + xs + [2, 1]` (i.e. `=` without `let` or `var` means mutation)<br>&gt; Mutating method call becomes explicit: `mutate xs.sort()` and `let x = mutate xs.removeAtIndex(2)`<br>&gt; Mutating function arguments are explicit with the `&amp;` prefix: `swap(&amp;xs, &amp;ys)`<br>&gt; Mutating operators are implicit and by convention, should end with the `=` symbol: `xs += [8, 9]`<br>&gt; Reference types have no notion of `mutating` members (and probably ought to remain that way) so they mutate implicitly.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I should also point out that under the assignment method paradigm one<br>&gt;&gt; would probably need to re-evalutate rules for naming.  Under the current<br>&gt;&gt; API guidelines&#39; approach, we&#39;d write:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;    x.=sorted()      // sort x in-place<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; and I am not sure how easy that would be for people to swallow<br>&gt;&gt; considering how much more straightforward<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;    x.sort()         // current way to sort x in-place<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; is, and because the language now contains explicit notation for<br>&gt;&gt; mutation, it becomes harder to argue against theis pair:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;    y = x.sort()<br>&gt;&gt;    x.=sort()      // sort x in place<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I agree that the current API guidelines wouldn&#39;t work for value types anymore. Both `sort` and `sorted` would be called `sort`.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Lastly, I should point out that the proposal does nothing to solve the<br>&gt;&gt; problem of `c.formSuccessor(&amp;i)`, since that doesn&#39;t mutate the<br>&gt;&gt; receiver.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This proposal does address the problem of `c.formSuccessor(&amp;i)`. Given that it&#39;s value types at play here, what mutates in the following is unambiguous even to non-native English speakers:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     c.frobnicate(&amp;i)                // cannot possibly mutate c but mutates i<br>&gt;     let j = c.frobnicate(i)         // cannot possibly mutate either<br>&gt;     mutate c.frobnicate(i)          // mutates c<br>&gt;     let k = mutate c.frobnicate(&amp;i) // mutates both<br></p><p>How would this chain if I wanted to do something like:<br></p><p>let median = foo.calculateBigHugeArray().sort().medianValue()<br></p><p>and I want the sort to be done in place.

If you want to move forward with something like<br>&gt;&gt; this, you need to solve the problems described above.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I think this proposal would simplify all code handling value types. Yes, it adds one keyword of boilerplate but wins clarity in return. I think reference types should stay separate from this discussion, as their mutation has always been implicit anyway.

On the other hand, the above code already works using the non-mutating `.sort()` (to be known as `.sorted()` in Swift 3), and—correct me if I&#39;m wrong—the compiler probably optimises the copy away using copy-on-write anyway.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Or will this type of thing just be disallowed in favor of.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; let array = foo.calculateBigHugeArray()<br>&gt;&gt; mutate array.sort()<br>&gt;&gt; let median = array.medianValue() <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Yes, I think mutating code should be written in many statements rather than squeezing everything into one long expression.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Indeed, no currently working method chaining would be disallowed in my proposal.

One of the attendees stayed behind to ask<br>&gt;&gt; about the naming guidelines for mutating vs non-mutating. He is fairly<br>&gt;&gt; new to Swift - coming from Ruby. I have no Ruby experience but am<br>&gt;&gt; passing his thoughts on to this list.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; He said that in Ruby they decorate the name with a symbol (I believe<br>&gt;&gt; in their case it is “!”) to distinguish between the two. Although<br>&gt;&gt; usually I’m not a fan of such naming conventions, we do something<br>&gt;&gt; similar with inout parameters.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; For example, if we have<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; func myFunc(param: inout String) { …}<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; we call it like this (using the Swift 3 first label convention)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; myFunc(param: &amp;aName)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; We use the &amp; to signal that the value of aName might be changed by the call to myFunc().<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Similarly, instead of settling on a naming convention for verb vs<br>&gt;&gt; verbed/verbing we could name the methods descriptively and require a<br>&gt;&gt; symbol (here I use &amp; but only for illustration) to distinguish between<br>&gt;&gt; mutating and non-mutating<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; so we would have <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; myArray.sort&amp;()<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; and<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; sortedArray = myArray.sort()<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Xcode and other tools could enforce this naming pattern and warn us<br>&gt;&gt; that a mutating method must end in “&amp;” and that a non-mutating method<br>&gt;&gt; is not allowed to.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This is not a new idea.  Something almost identical to this has been<br>&gt; explored and discussed quite thoroughly already:<br>&gt; &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/proposals/Inplace.rst &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/proposals/Inplace.rst&gt;&gt;.<br>&gt; In fact, it was implmented and later reverted because it raised<br>&gt; language-design questions for which we had no good answers.  I don&#39;t<br>&gt; believe the choice of glyph (&amp; vs =) affects any of the fundamental<br>&gt; issues:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * Should the x.=f() syntax be required for *every* mutating method<br>&gt;  invocation?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * Are assignment methods a redundant way to spell mutating methods?<br>&gt;  Should we really have both mechanisms?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * Can we really introduce this feature without having a way to apply it<br>&gt;  to class types?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I should also point out that under the assignment method paradigm one<br>&gt; would probably need to re-evalutate rules for naming.  Under the current<br>&gt; API guidelines&#39; approach, we&#39;d write:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    x.=sorted()      // sort x in-place<br>&gt; <br>&gt; and I am not sure how easy that would be for people to swallow<br>&gt; considering how much more straightforward<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    x.sort()         // current way to sort x in-place<br>&gt; <br>&gt; is, and because the language now contains explicit notation for<br>&gt; mutation, it becomes harder to argue against theis pair:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    y = x.sort()<br>&gt;    x.=sort()      // sort x in place<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Lastly, I should point out that the proposal does nothing to solve the<br>&gt; problem of `c.formSuccessor(&amp;i)`, since that doesn&#39;t mutate the<br>&gt; receiver.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I still like the proposal&#39;s basic approach and would love to see it used<br>&gt; to address these naming problems, but I want to be clear that it&#39;s by no<br>&gt; means a panacea and there are real obstacles between here and actually<br>&gt; being able to apply it.  If you want to move forward with something like<br>&gt; this, you need to solve the problems described above.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Dave<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160425/c64c7a30/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d53b7c5f9b5f5557b9082face9b632a0?s=50"></div><header><strong>mutating/non-mutating suggestion from a Rubyist</strong> from <string>Dave Abrahams</string> &lt;dabrahams at apple.com&gt;<p>April 25, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>on Mon Apr 25 2016, Radosław Pietruszewski &lt;radexpl-AT-gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Q: Would it be possible to allow some sigil in method names (say, prefix/postfix<br>&gt; `=`) without any automatic/magic treatment of these methods?<br></p><p>Almost anything is possible ;-).<br></p><p>&gt; In Ruby, after all, postfix `!` is just allowed in names.
