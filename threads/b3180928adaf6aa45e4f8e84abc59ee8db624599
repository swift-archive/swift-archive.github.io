It would be really nice to have a little bit more control over which properties participate in memberwise initialization when the “automatic” rules don’t quite do the right thing for a particular use case.<br></p><p>Matthew<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; Félix<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Le 6 janv. 2016 à 19:04:41, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jan 6, 2016, at 2:47 PM, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The review of &quot;Flexible Memberwise Initialization&quot; begins now and runs through January 10th.

If we move to a multiple-argument model for functions rather than the current every-function-takes-a-tuple-argument model, then we will likely need at least limited support for packing and unpacking tuples from and to arguments in order to avoid regressing at argument forwarding use cases. However, even that limited packing/unpacking functionality might be enough to seriously consider a more general magic &quot;members&quot; property as an alternative.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I don’t mind discussing an alternative using this approach.  If we’re going to do that I think it must be clear how it would cover various intended use cases in detail.  Specifically, how would we address:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 1. Default parameter values (at least for `var` properties)<br>&gt;&gt; 2. `let` properties: it seems pretty magical indeed if the computed `var` property exposing the tuple could be used to initialize a `let` property.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Yeah, this member would need special initialization abilities, I agree.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 3. Partial memberwise initialization exposing a subset of members following some kind of “automatic” or “opt-in” model for determining the subset.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Seems to me that could be done by factoring the interesting subsets into structs, e.g.:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;   internal struct MemberwiseProperties {<br>&gt;     var x,y,z: Int<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt;   internal var state: MemberwiseProperties<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   init(members...: MemberwiseProperties.Members) {<br>&gt;     state.members = members<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; }<br></p><p>And this is more clear than this?<br></p><p>class Foo {<br>  var x,y,z: Int<br>  init(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int) {<br>    self.x = x<br>    self.y = y<br>    self.z = z<br>  }<br>}<br></p><p>It seems odd to me to change the design of your type for the sole purpose of using a language feature. <br></p><p>It’s the complexity of the feature and its applicability only to initialization that lead me to vote no for the proposal. I&#39;ve wanted public, generated initializers (ask to the internal generated struct inits). However, as you dig into to see what you really need to support, the complexities become quite nuanced.<br></p><p>I keep coming back to a much simpler and more explicit desire of being able to use “self” (this is not a label, but an annotation like &quot;inout&quot;) in the parameter list. This is applicable to all members of a type.<br></p><p>class Foo {<br>  var x,y,z: Int<br>  init(self x: Int, self y: Int, self z: Int) {<br>    // the compiler auto-inserts these lines<br>    self.x = x<br>    self.y = y<br>    self.z = z<br>  }<br></p><p>  func fooey(self x: Int) {<br>    // the compiler generates<br>    self.x = x<br>  }<br>}<br></p><p>I’m not convinced that even that is worth the magic it brings to the table, but it does get rid of nearly all of the complexities, becomes more applicable than just initialization, and has only a single rule to learn that is fairly self-explanatory. The trade-off is you must be explicit about the members of the initializer. I’m OK with that because if I have a type that really has so many members that this is a burden, then I should probably refactor it. A sufficient macro system also trivially solves this issue as well.<br></p><p>-David<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160107/169f2c62/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/06c1dcc7dce6a93d194b9c013376e3f0?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0018 Flexible Memberwise Initialization</strong> from <string>Joe Groff</string> &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt;<p>January  7, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jan 7, 2016, at 10:32 AM, David Owens II &lt;david at owensd.io&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; And this is more clear than this?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;   var x,y,z: Int<br>&gt;   init(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int) {<br>&gt;     self.x = x<br>&gt;     self.y = y<br>&gt;     self.z = z<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; }<br></p><p>No, it isn&#39;t, but Matthew asked… I&#39;m personally not too motivated to support anything more than all-or-nothing memberwise initialization, and tend to agree that anything more specialized deserves an explicit implementation.<br></p><p>-Joe<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160107/dfbbff79/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc3a9ea0c6c870343d9acb4ac3059cdc?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0018 Flexible Memberwise Initialization</strong> from <string>Matthew Johnson</string> &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt;<p>January  7, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jan 7, 2016, at 12:37 PM, Joe Groff &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jan 7, 2016, at 10:32 AM, David Owens II &lt;david at owensd.io &lt;mailto:david at owensd.io&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; And this is more clear than this?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;   var x,y,z: Int<br>&gt;&gt;   init(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int) {<br>&gt;&gt;     self.x = x<br>&gt;&gt;     self.y = y<br>&gt;&gt;     self.z = z<br>&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; No, it isn&#39;t, but Matthew asked… I&#39;m personally not too motivated to support anything more than all-or-nothing memberwise initialization, and tend to agree that anything more specialized deserves an explicit implementation.<br></p><p>Maybe you would feel differently if you were an app developer.

Memberwise initialization is very valuable for the appearance attributes, but is useless if it exposes our implementation details.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 2. In many custom UI widgets the appearance attributes don’t really need to be mutable post-initialization.  At the same time, it is necessary to allow, but not require a value to be specified.  It would be ideal if they were `let` properties with a default value, but still able to participate in memberwise initialization.  Without that capability we are forced to choose between the advantages of using a `let` property and the advantages of memberwise initialization.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; UI widgets are a great example.

In practice it wouldn’t be a problem for projects I’ve worked on, and I suspect others would say the same or may have commented on this already.  But I do understand why you want to avoid the possibility of increasing the visibility of a member breaking code.  <br></p><p>Nevertheless, I feel that access control rules should be applied to memberwise initializers unless we go with the opt-in model where the programmer explicitly states which properties are relevant to memberwise initialization and which are not.  I don’t think exposing more-private members in an more-public initializers without an explicit request to do so is a good idea.  And I don’t think the `memberwise` declaration modifier on the initializer itself is enough to constitute and explicit request to do this.<br></p><p>The safest, most clear, most robust way to determine the correct set of properties to use is to go with the opt-in model.  The downside of that is that it requires a declaration modifier on properties to opt-in.  I am not opposed to going down this path at all, but I believe Chris thinks it would be too verbose for a convenience feature to require that (although he seemed to be comfortable with offering it as an alternative when requested in a specific case by the programmer).<br></p><p>Matthew<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160107/49f77541/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc3a9ea0c6c870343d9acb4ac3059cdc?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0018 Flexible Memberwise Initialization</strong> from <string>Matthew Johnson</string> &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt;<p>January  8, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jan 7, 2016, at 8:30 PM, Joe Groff &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jan 7, 2016, at 11:30 AM, Matthew Johnson &lt;matthew at anandabits.com &lt;mailto:matthew at anandabits.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jan 7, 2016, at 12:51 PM, Joe Groff &lt;jgroff at apple.com &lt;mailto:jgroff at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jan 7, 2016, at 10:49 AM, Matthew Johnson &lt;matthew at anandabits.com &lt;mailto:matthew at anandabits.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jan 7, 2016, at 12:37 PM, Joe Groff &lt;jgroff at apple.com &lt;mailto:jgroff at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jan 7, 2016, at 10:32 AM, David Owens II &lt;david at owensd.io &lt;mailto:david at owensd.io&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And this is more clear than this?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   var x,y,z: Int<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   init(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int) {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     self.x = x<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     self.y = y<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     self.z = z<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it isn&#39;t, but Matthew asked… I&#39;m personally not too motivated to support anything more than all-or-nothing memberwise initialization, and tend to agree that anything more specialized deserves an explicit implementation.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe you would feel differently if you were an app developer.

Several of the possible enhancements are attempts to allow the programmer to be more explicit when the rules don’t do the right thing.  The breakage you describe is an example where that would be necessary.<br></p><p>The solution I believe is the best one (assuming the automatic model) is allowing distinct access control for initialization.  Initialization is conceptually distinct from both getting and setting.  We already allow programmers to specify distinct access levels for `get` and `set` (for `var`), but we don’t for `init`.  It feels like a natural extension of the access control model to allow a distinction for initialization.  The `init` access level could also be used in phase 1 for manually written initializers, rather than the `get` visibility of a `let` property and the `set` visibility of a `var` that is used today.<br></p><p>It would solve the problem problem you mention above by allowing the access control to be specified as `internal private(init)` rather than just `internal`.  This access control change would have no impact on memberwise initializers.<br></p><p>This would also solve the problem you mentioned earlier that `let` properties more capable than `private(set) var` properties.  It would no longer be necessary to use the `set` access level because there would be a distinct access level for `init`.  In that case, the programmer could specify exactly what is desired: <br></p><p>1. `public private(set)` would allow public memberwise initializers to synthesize a parameter for the property<br>2. `private public(get)` would only allow private memberwise initializers to synthesize a parameter for the property.  Only the getter would be visible publicly.<br>3. `public private(init)` would only allow private memberwise initializers to synthesize a parameter for the property. Both the getter and setter would be visible publicly.<br></p><p>Ultimately, I think the automatic model is only a good idea if we enforce access control.  Allowing the distinction to be made solves the problems you have pointed out while also allowing the programmer to get the desired behavior out of the automatic model in most or all cases.  For those reasons I think it would be a significant improvement over the current proposal.<br></p><p>Matthew<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160108/a943ef32/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/945b22bad6d88de707d2ae9531c185ff?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0018 Flexible Memberwise Initialization</strong> from <string>Thorsten Seitz</string> &lt;trsfoo at googlemail.com&gt;<p>January  8, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Am 07.01.2016 um 20:30 schrieb Matthew Johnson via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Here is an example where partial memberwise initialization would apply.

I enjoy the current memberwise initializer feature and would like to see it become useful in more cases.<br></p><p>One thing I don&#39;t like (and was intending to discuss—the review snuck up on me) is the keyword `memberwise`. This is the name of the current feature, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very well-chosen. &quot;Member&quot; refers to all of the things attached to a type: properties, subscripts, methods, initializers, etc. But a &quot;memberwise&quot; initializer only initializes the stored properties, not any of these other things. Perhaps instead of `memberwise`, the keyword should be `property` or `propertywise`.<br></p><p>I&#39;m not precisely sure what would be best, and keyword bikeshedding might be best left for a separate proposal. In any case, this defect is not nearly severe enough to make me want to scuttle the feature.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. The current memberwise initializers are unavailable in any situation with even the slightest complications. I think this proposal vastly improves the feature.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>I think it does. It makes something that was previously implicit explicit instead, reducing boilerplate while still providing plenty of flexibility.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>I haven&#39;t, unless you count highly dynamic languages where you can easily build a constructor that initializes from a dictionary. This proposal is *far* more explicit than that sort of solution, which seems like an improvement to me.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>I&#39;ve participated in discussions about this feature since before it was formally proposed; I think I may have been the first person to bring up memberwise initializers as a target for improvement on this list. I&#39;ve dug around in the Swift compiler and took a vague stab at implementing some related features, although I didn&#39;t get very far.

My only concern with this specific proposal is that on an initial glance it&#39;s not easy to intuit what the behavior is. I like the end result of this proposal, and I think since it&#39;d be frequently used it&#39;d be easy to remember what it was despite being unintuitive.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I had originally suggested this alternative:<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt; struct Foo {<br>&gt;     let bar: String<br>&gt;     let bas: Int<br>&gt;     let baz: Double<br>&gt;     init(self.bar: String, self.bas: Int, bax: Int) {<br>&gt;           // self.bar = bar synthesized by the compiler<br>&gt;           // self.bas = bas synthesized by the compiler<br>&gt;         self.baz = Double(bax)<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt; The upside of this is that it&#39;s more clear what happens, downside is that adding a property requires 2 changes (as opposed to current 3, but more than the 1 change required in proposal).<br></p><p>The problem with this is that you have to duplicate information and you may often have more than one initializer.  It ends up being much more verbose.  I don’t think it adds enough value over fully manual initialization to warrant a language change.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; Perhaps a syntax more along the lines of this would be more intuitive and still eliminate the boilerplate.<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt; struct Foo {<br>&gt;     let bar: String<br>&gt;     let bas: Int<br>&gt;     let baz: Double<br>&gt;     init(bax: Int, self = ...) {<br>&gt;           // self.bar = bar synthesized by the compiler<br>&gt;           // self.bas = bas synthesized by the compiler<br>&gt;         self.baz = Double(bax)<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt; `memberwise` means nothing to the uninitiated, and `...` without any other operator is a little confusing. I think this solves the issue of saying what the `...`  is doing.<br></p><p>I don’t like this.  People are going to have to learn the language regardless of the syntax.  Remember that the initializer will have the `memberwise` declaration modifier in addition to the `…` in the parameter list.  I don’t think `self = …` would be more clear than that to people who have learned about memberwise initialization.  And it feels like something that should belong in the body of the initializer if it was required.<br></p><p><br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Thu, Jan 7, 2016 at 10:12 AM Matthew Johnson via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; On Jan 7, 2016, at 2:46 AM, Kevin Ballard via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; +1 to the basic proposal. I&#39;m much more reserved about the &quot;Future enhancements&quot;; some I don&#39;t want at all, some sound plausible but probably need changes.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks for your support Kevin!  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; As I stated last night, there are two primary things that I think need improving via enhancements of some kind.  I hope you can agree with these points:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1. We need a way to specify a default value for memberwise parameters for `let` properties.<br>&gt; 2. We need a little bit more control over which properties participate in memberwise initialization when the “automatic” rules don’t quite do the right thing for a particular use case.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Most of the enhancements listed show various ways we could address the second point.  We don’t need all of them.  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Under the current proposal there will be cases where memberwise initialization would be of great use, but the rules of the automatic model expose a property (probably a `let`) that shouldn’t be exposed.  We won’t be able to use memberwise initialization at all in those cases if we don’t have a way to correct that behavior.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; There may also be cases where a property doesn’t participate in memberwsie initialization when we would like it to.  In those cases we can add an explicit parameter and manually initialize the property, continuing to use memberwise initialization for other properties.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Ideally we can find a simple enhancement that solves both visibility problems.  I’m definitely open to any ideas on how we can handle this.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Also, a question and a concern about the basic proposal. The question: you state that the only impact this has on existing code is structs with private properties that have been getting an implicit internal memberwise initializer will have the initializer be private. That&#39;s fine, but assuming that the implicit memberwise initializer behaves identically to `memberwise init(...) {}`, surely this proposal also makes the implicit memberwise initializer gain defaulted arguments for any var properties with an initializer expression? Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think it&#39;s good to change that, but it should be explicitly noted.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That is a great point!  It won’t break any existing code, but it will change behavior slightly.  I will update the proposal and submit a PR with this change.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; As for my concern, it&#39;s with the following rule:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If the initializer body assigns to a var property that received memberwise initialization synthesis report a warning. It is unlikely that overwriting the value provided by the caller is the desired behavior.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I understand why you put this in there, but this is a warning that cannot be suppressed and will make it impossible to use a memberwise initializer for perfectly legitimate cases where you do in fact want to mutate the property after it&#39;s been assigned to.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; For normal initializers I agree with you.  However, I think it’s a reasonable for callers to assume that if you expose a property via memberwise initialization the post-initialization value will match the value they provide.  This warning is intended to alert you to the fact that you are violating that reasonable assumption.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Do you have an example of where you would want a caller to initialize a property, but then overwrite the value they provide during initialization?<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; What might be a reasonable thing is a warning that occurs if you assign to the var property without ever having read from it (i.e. a dead store warning on the memberwise initialization of the property).

Modification reads it first. `x += 2` reads<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; `x` before writing to it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I stand corrected.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -Thorsten<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -Kevin Ballard<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br></p><p><br>-- <br>Best Regards!<br></p><p>Yang Wu<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>Location: Pudong, Shanghai, China.<br>EMail    : pinxue at gmail.com<br>Website: http://www.time2change.mobi http://rockplayer.com<br>Twitter/Weibo : @pinxue<br>&lt;http://www.pinxue.net&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160109/b6707c07/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b6a0b6562cd412f587c69d192f335161?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0018 Flexible Memberwise Initialization</strong> from <string>plx</string> &lt;plxswift at icloud.com&gt;<p>January  7, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>I like the general notion of something along these lines but admittedly haven’t had time to dig into the proposal specifics yet.<br></p><p>I have some concerns about cross-interactions with other features that are either also under discussion or are at least very anticipatable.<br></p><p>First, I know there has already been some discussion of allowing definition of stored fields in (some) extensions (e.g., something like allowing definition of stored fields in extensions within the module that defines the type).<br></p><p>E.G., something like this may become possible (assume all files are compiled together):<br></p><p>    // in `ComplicatedClass.swift`<br>    class ComplicatedClass {<br>      let text: String<br>      <br>      // how will this get expanded,<br>      // given the extensions below?<br>      memberwise init(...)<br>    }<br>    <br>    // in `ComplicatedClass+Foo.swift`<br>    extension ComplicatedClass {<br>      var fooData: Foo? = nil<br>      // presumably stuff-involving-`fooData`<br>    }<br>    <br>    // in `ComplicatedClass+Bar.swift`<br>    extension ComplicatedClass {<br>      var barData: Bar = Bar.standardBar<br>      // presumably stuff-involving-`barData`<br>    }<br></p><p>It doesn&#39;t seem impossible to specify how the memberwise-initialization would interact with constructs like the above, but I&#39;d worry a bit about it making a feature that&#39;s already looking *rather* complicated even more so.<br></p><p>Especially since, if I had to pick just one, I&#39;d think the ability to define stored properties outside the initial definition is a bigger win than a nice memberwise-initialization construct, even though both seem handy.<br></p><p>Secondly, I’m a bit unsure how this will interact with e.g. the property-behavior proposal if both wind up ratified.

My understanding is that the extension will need to initialize its own properties, either with an initial value or with a `partial init`.  Designated initializers would be required to call the `partial init` for any extension that defines one.<br></p><p>This being the case, memberwise initialization would not directly interact with this feature at all.  Memberwise initializers declared in the main body of type itself would only expose stored properties defined in the type itself.  <br></p><p>It would also be possible to support `partial memberwise init` in extensions which would expose the stored properties declared in the extension as part of a partial initializer.<br></p><p>I don’t think there are difficult complications here.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; Secondly, I’m a bit unsure how this will interact with e.g. the property-behavior proposal if both wind up ratified. For `lazy`, the interaction with `memberwise` is easy — it is omitted from the list — but when you get into e.g. something like a hypothetical `logged` or `synchronized` or `atomic` — wherein there is custom behavior, but the field would still need initialization — you’d want them to be included in the<br>&gt; `memberwise` init.<br></p><p>My thought here is that a behavior would define whether a property allows and / or requires initialization in phase 1 or not.  This is probably necessary independent of memberwise initialization.  Properties that allow or require phase 1 initialization would be eligible for memberwise initialization.  Properties that don’t allow phase 1 initialization would not be eligible for memberwise initialization.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; It’s a bit unfair to bring up another proposal, but this proposal and something like the property-behavior proposal *would* need to work well together (if both are approved).<br></p><p>Agreed.

These may not always be identical.<br></p><p>Agree.  This is something that could be addressed in a future enhancement if necessary.  This proposal is focused on the basic mechanism.<br></p><p>Also, nothing in the proposal prevents you from continuing to write a manual initializer when the synthesized initializer will not do what you require.  If you are already explicitly restating the property identifiers to specify parameter order you are already half way to a manual initializer implementation.  <br></p><p>Granted, if you need more than one memberwise initializer you would have to duplicate that effort.

functionality` surface, as it were; it seems like both of these are possible:<br></p><p>- (a) make it a bit more flexible, for a high gain in functionality at a low incremental cost in complexity<br>- (b) make it a bit less flexible, for a modest loss in functionality and a large drop in complexity<br></p><p>…but for (b) it’s just a feeling and I don’t have a specific proposal (this may well be close to a minimum-viable-proposal for such a feature).<br></p><p>For (a) my sense is that although I can understand why you don’t want to even provide the option of specifying an explicit memberwise-parameter list, it really does seem that supporting at least an optional list makes it possible to get a lot more functionality for not much more *actual* complexity;

<br>&gt;&gt; I have some concerns about cross-interactions with other features that are either also under discussion or are at least very anticipatable.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; First, I know there has already been some discussion of allowing definition of stored fields in (some) extensions (e.g., something like allowing definition of stored fields in extensions within the module that defines the type).<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; E.G., something like this may become possible (assume all files are compiled together):<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;   // in `ComplicatedClass.swift`<br>&gt;&gt;   class ComplicatedClass {<br>&gt;&gt;     let text: String<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;     // how will this get expanded,<br>&gt;&gt;     // given the extensions below?<br>&gt;&gt;     memberwise init(...)<br>&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;   // in `ComplicatedClass+Foo.swift`<br>&gt;&gt;   extension ComplicatedClass {<br>&gt;&gt;     var fooData: Foo? = nil<br>&gt;&gt;     // presumably stuff-involving-`fooData`<br>&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;   // in `ComplicatedClass+Bar.swift`<br>&gt;&gt;   extension ComplicatedClass {<br>&gt;&gt;     var barData: Bar = Bar.standardBar<br>&gt;&gt;     // presumably stuff-involving-`barData`<br>&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; It doesn&#39;t seem impossible to specify how the memberwise-initialization would interact with constructs like the above, but I&#39;d worry a bit about it making a feature that&#39;s already looking *rather* complicated even more so.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Especially since, if I had to pick just one, I&#39;d think the ability to define stored properties outside the initial definition is a bigger win than a nice memberwise-initialization construct, even though both seem handy.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I followed the stored-properties-in-extensions discussion reasonably closely.  My understanding is that the extension will need to initialize its own properties, either with an initial value or with a `partial init`.  Designated initializers would be required to call the `partial init` for any extension that defines one.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This being the case, memberwise initialization would not directly interact with this feature at all.  Memberwise initializers declared in the main body of type itself would only expose stored properties defined in the type itself.  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; It would also be possible to support `partial memberwise init` in extensions which would expose the stored properties declared in the extension as part of a partial initializer.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I don’t think there are difficult complications here.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Secondly, I’m a bit unsure how this will interact with e.g. the property-behavior proposal if both wind up ratified. For `lazy`, the interaction with `memberwise` is easy — it is omitted from the list — but when you get into e.g. something like a hypothetical `logged` or `synchronized` or `atomic` — wherein there is custom behavior, but the field would still need initialization — you’d want them to be included in the<br>&gt;&gt; `memberwise` init.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; My thought here is that a behavior would define whether a property allows and / or requires initialization in phase 1 or not.  This is probably necessary independent of memberwise initialization.  Properties that allow or require phase 1 initialization would be eligible for memberwise initialization. Properties that don’t allow phase 1 initialization would not be eligible for memberwise initialization.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; It’s a bit unfair to bring up another proposal, but this proposal and something like the property-behavior proposal *would* need to work well together (if both are approved).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Agreed.  That is why there is a rule that references property behaviors in the proposal.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Thirdly, I’m not sure what the current plans are (if any) for users to be able to specify the precise memory-layout of a struct; apologies if this is already a feature, I simply haven’t looked into it.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; **Today**: I order stored-field declarations for ease-of-reading (e.g. grouped into logical groups, and organized for ease-of-reading).<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; **Under Proposal**: I sometimes will get to choose between the “ease-of-reading” declaration ordering and the “cleanest-reading memberwise init” declaration ordering. These may not always be identical.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Agree.  This is something that could be addressed in a future enhancement if necessary.  This proposal is focused on the basic mechanism.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Also, nothing in the proposal prevents you from continuing to write a manual initializer when the synthesized initializer will not do what you require.  If you are already explicitly restating the property identifiers to specify parameter order you are already half way to a manual initializer implementation.  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Granted, if you need more than one memberwise initializer you would have to duplicate that effort.  But re-ordering is going to have a hard time providing enough value if the basic feature does what we need in the majority of cases.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; **Future?**: I may have to choose between the “ease-of-reading” declaration ordering, the “cleanest-reading member wise init” declaration ordering, and (perhaps?) the “intended memory-layout” declaration ordering.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I don’t want to make this proposal more-complicated than it already is, but I worry a bit about having too many things impacting the choice of how to order declarations in source files; it may be better to include a way to explicitly declare the ordering-for-memberwise:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; E.G., some way of explicitly indicating the memberwise ordering, perhaps like this:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;   // syntax example re-using `ComplicatedClass`<br>&gt;&gt;   class ComplicatedClass  {<br>&gt;&gt;     @memberwise($parameterList)<br>&gt;&gt;     // ^ can use just @memberwise to get default ordering + the defaults from<br>&gt;&gt;     //   the property declarations, but perhaps require the explicit listing<br>&gt;&gt;     //   whenver the ordering is not well-defined (e.g. if you have properties<br>&gt;&gt;     //   declared in extensions…then you need to order it yourself)<br>&gt;&gt;     // <br>&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise(text=&quot;Example&quot;,barData=,fooData)<br>&gt;&gt;     //   - `text=&quot;Example&quot;` =&gt; memberwise init has text=&quot;Example&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;     //   - `barData=` =&gt; memberwise init has `barData` w/out default<br>&gt;&gt;     //   - `fooData` =&gt; memberwise init has `fooData` w/default if it has one<br>&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;     //   …and e.g. the above would make:<br>&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;     //   memberwise init(...)<br>&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;     //   ...expand-to:<br>&gt;&gt;     // <br>&gt;&gt;     //   init(text:String = &quot;Example&quot;, barData: Bar, fooData:Foo?=nil)<br>&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;     //   ...and with the @memberwise declaration supporting a `...` for `super`<br>&gt;&gt;     //   placement, like so:<br>&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;     //   // superclass members come before:<br>&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise(...,)<br>&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise(...,$parameterList)<br>&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;     //   // superclass members come after      <br>&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise(,...)<br>&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise($parameterList,...)<br>&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;     //   ...perhaps with tweaked syntax (`@memberwise(...,$)` or `@memberwise(...,self)`)<br>&gt;&gt;     //   to be bit easier to read when you don&#39;t have an explicit parameter list?<br>&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; ...which of course potentially only-further complicates the feature in some ways, but avoids having this use of this feature *necessarily* impact how one might choose to order declarations?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jan 6, 2016, at 4:47 PM, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The review of &quot;Flexible Memberwise Initialization&quot; begins now and runs through January 10th.

My understanding is that the extension will need to initialize its own properties, either with an initial value or with a `partial init`.  Designated initializers would be required to call the `partial init` for any extension that defines one.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; This being the case, memberwise initialization would not directly interact with this feature at all.  Memberwise initializers declared in the main body of type itself would only expose stored properties defined in the type itself.  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; It would also be possible to support `partial memberwise init` in extensions which would expose the stored properties declared in the extension as part of a partial initializer.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I don’t think there are difficult complications here.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Secondly, I’m a bit unsure how this will interact with e.g. the property-behavior proposal if both wind up ratified. For `lazy`, the interaction with `memberwise` is easy — it is omitted from the list — but when you get into e.g. something like a hypothetical `logged` or `synchronized` or `atomic` — wherein there is custom behavior, but the field would still need initialization — you’d want them to be included in the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; `memberwise` init.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; My thought here is that a behavior would define whether a property allows and / or requires initialization in phase 1 or not.  This is probably necessary independent of memberwise initialization.  Properties that allow or require phase 1 initialization would be eligible for memberwise initialization. Properties that don’t allow phase 1 initialization would not be eligible for memberwise initialization.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s a bit unfair to bring up another proposal, but this proposal and something like the property-behavior proposal *would* need to work well together (if both are approved).<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Agreed.  That is why there is a rule that references property behaviors in the proposal.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Thirdly, I’m not sure what the current plans are (if any) for users to be able to specify the precise memory-layout of a struct; apologies if this is already a feature, I simply haven’t looked into it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; **Today**: I order stored-field declarations for ease-of-reading (e.g. grouped into logical groups, and organized for ease-of-reading).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; **Under Proposal**: I sometimes will get to choose between the “ease-of-reading” declaration ordering and the “cleanest-reading memberwise init” declaration ordering. These may not always be identical.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Agree.  This is something that could be addressed in a future enhancement if necessary.  This proposal is focused on the basic mechanism.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Also, nothing in the proposal prevents you from continuing to write a manual initializer when the synthesized initializer will not do what you require.  If you are already explicitly restating the property identifiers to specify parameter order you are already half way to a manual initializer implementation.  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Granted, if you need more than one memberwise initializer you would have to duplicate that effort.  But re-ordering is going to have a hard time providing enough value if the basic feature does what we need in the majority of cases.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; **Future?**: I may have to choose between the “ease-of-reading” declaration ordering, the “cleanest-reading member wise init” declaration ordering, and (perhaps?) the “intended memory-layout” declaration ordering.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don’t want to make this proposal more-complicated than it already is, but I worry a bit about having too many things impacting the choice of how to order declarations in source files; it may be better to include a way to explicitly declare the ordering-for-memberwise:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; E.G., some way of explicitly indicating the memberwise ordering, perhaps like this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   // syntax example re-using `ComplicatedClass`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   class ComplicatedClass  {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     @memberwise($parameterList)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     // ^ can use just @memberwise to get default ordering + the defaults from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   the property declarations, but perhaps require the explicit listing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   whenver the ordering is not well-defined (e.g. if you have properties<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   declared in extensions…then you need to order it yourself)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     // <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise(text=&quot;Example&quot;,barData=,fooData)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   - `text=&quot;Example&quot;` =&gt; memberwise init has text=&quot;Example&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   - `barData=` =&gt; memberwise init has `barData` w/out default<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   - `fooData` =&gt; memberwise init has `fooData` w/default if it has one<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   …and e.g. the above would make:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   memberwise init(...)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   ...expand-to:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     // <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   init(text:String = &quot;Example&quot;, barData: Bar, fooData:Foo?=nil)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   ...and with the @memberwise declaration supporting a `...` for `super`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   placement, like so:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   // superclass members come before:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise(...,)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise(...,$parameterList)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   // superclass members come after      <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise(,...)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise($parameterList,...)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   ...perhaps with tweaked syntax (`@memberwise(...,$)` or `@memberwise(...,self)`)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   to be bit easier to read when you don&#39;t have an explicit parameter list?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ...which of course potentially only-further complicates the feature in some ways, but avoids having this use of this feature *necessarily* impact how one might choose to order declarations?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jan 6, 2016, at 4:47 PM, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The review of &quot;Flexible Memberwise Initialization&quot; begins now and runs through January 10th.

So far I don’t think any of those add enough value over current state to be worth considering.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; For (a) my sense is that although I can understand why you don’t want to even provide the option of specifying an explicit memberwise-parameter list, it really does seem that supporting at least an optional list makes it possible to get a lot more functionality for not much more *actual* complexity; this isn’t incompatible with also supporting an “automatic” option that uses the logic from the proposal where possible.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In terms of (a), I definitely agree that it would be desirable to allow for a bit more functionality.  That is why I have suggested several enhancements.  I don’t think we want all of them, but some are definitely desirable.  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Chris really wanted to start with a core proposal and evaluate the enhancements independently, which is a good idea but also makes the proposal slightly less flexible than desirable.  The enhancements I feel are most important are:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1. We need a way to specify a default value for memberwise parameters for `let` properties.<br>&gt; 2. We need a little bit more control over which properties participate in memberwise initialization when the “automatic” rules don’t quite do the right thing for a particular use case.  I think allowing distinct access control for `init` is the best way to handle this.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; You mention specifying an explicit parameter list but don’t really elaborate further.  Would the opt-in model described in the proposal meet what you have in mind?  Or are you also consider with parameter order being independent of property declaration order?<br></p><p>I included a mock syntax in my initial response but it was (a) at the end and (b) perhaps a bit too terse.

I’ll elaborate further down.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Here’s a concrete example to illustrate why I’m harping on this point; I apologize for the length, but I think “small-n” examples can often give false intuition into how things will behave in real life:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thank you for this!

Allowing stored properties in extensions automatically appear in a memberwise initializer violates that encapsulation.<br></p><p>&quot;Automatic appearance&quot; would definitely be bad; it’d seem like using such extensions would have to get you disqualified for automatic synthesis.<br></p><p>It’s still a tricky point though given the uncertainty about future directions; there seems to be some discussion of allowing protocols to define (instead of merely require) stored properties, which would perhaps be yet-another wrinkle to have to at least consider.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; The good news is that a general parameter forwarding mechanism can help if the extension init (or super init) requires a bunch of arguments and you just want to forward them from your caller.  This is alluded to in the enhancement section of the proposal but is really a completely general and orthogonal feature.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It might look something like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; memberwise init(…superArgs, …partial1args, …partial2args, …memberwise) {<br>&gt; 	extension1.init(directArgument: 42, …partial1args)<br>&gt; 	extension2.init(…partial2args)<br>&gt; 	super.init(…superArgs)<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; A couple things to note about how this might work:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1.

Any parameters for which a direct argument is not provided are “captured” by the `…identifier` placeholder. <br>&gt; 3. Parameters matching those captured by the identifier are synthesized in the location specified in the parameter list.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Obviously this won’t help if the extensions only require a single argument.  But if you have extensions requiring several arguments that you want to pass through it would help<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Which is ultimately why I suspect that the “right&quot; version of the proposed feature should cut to the chase and incorporate some way to explicitly-specify the memberwise parameter list — which, again, need not be incompatible with the ability to request automatic synthesis using logic ~ what’s in the proposal — as such an explicit list takes the pressure off of getting the default behavior as-right-as-possible while also making it simpler to support some very nice-to-have capabilities not supported by this proposal as-written.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; How would this be different than the opt-in model described in the proposal?  Do you have something specific in mind?<br></p><p>This is what I had in the original.

My understanding is that the extension will need to initialize its own properties, either with an initial value or with a `partial init`.  Designated initializers would be required to call the `partial init` for any extension that defines one.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This being the case, memberwise initialization would not directly interact with this feature at all.  Memberwise initializers declared in the main body of type itself would only expose stored properties defined in the type itself.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It would also be possible to support `partial memberwise init` in extensions which would expose the stored properties declared in the extension as part of a partial initializer.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don’t think there are difficult complications here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Secondly, I’m a bit unsure how this will interact with e.g. the property-behavior proposal if both wind up ratified. For `lazy`, the interaction with `memberwise` is easy — it is omitted from the list — but when you get into e.g. something like a hypothetical `logged` or `synchronized` or `atomic` — wherein there is custom behavior, but the field would still need initialization — you’d want them to be included in the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `memberwise` init.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; My thought here is that a behavior would define whether a property allows and / or requires initialization in phase 1 or not.  This is probably necessary independent of memberwise initialization.  Properties that allow or require phase 1 initialization would be eligible for memberwise initialization. Properties that don’t allow phase 1 initialization would not be eligible for memberwise initialization.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s a bit unfair to bring up another proposal, but this proposal and something like the property-behavior proposal *would* need to work well together (if both are approved).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Agreed.  That is why there is a rule that references property behaviors in the proposal.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thirdly, I’m not sure what the current plans are (if any) for users to be able to specify the precise memory-layout of a struct; apologies if this is already a feature, I simply haven’t looked into it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Today**: I order stored-field declarations for ease-of-reading (e.g. grouped into logical groups, and organized for ease-of-reading).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Under Proposal**: I sometimes will get to choose between the “ease-of-reading” declaration ordering and the “cleanest-reading memberwise init” declaration ordering. These may not always be identical.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Agree.  This is something that could be addressed in a future enhancement if necessary.  This proposal is focused on the basic mechanism.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, nothing in the proposal prevents you from continuing to write a manual initializer when the synthesized initializer will not do what you require.  If you are already explicitly restating the property identifiers to specify parameter order you are already half way to a manual initializer implementation.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Granted, if you need more than one memberwise initializer you would have to duplicate that effort.  But re-ordering is going to have a hard time providing enough value if the basic feature does what we need in the majority of cases.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Future?**: I may have to choose between the “ease-of-reading” declaration ordering, the “cleanest-reading member wise init” declaration ordering, and (perhaps?) the “intended memory-layout” declaration ordering.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don’t want to make this proposal more-complicated than it already is, but I worry a bit about having too many things impacting the choice of how to order declarations in source files; it may be better to include a way to explicitly declare the ordering-for-memberwise:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; E.G., some way of explicitly indicating the memberwise ordering, perhaps like this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   // syntax example re-using `ComplicatedClass`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   class ComplicatedClass  {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     @memberwise($parameterList)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     // ^ can use just @memberwise to get default ordering + the defaults from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   the property declarations, but perhaps require the explicit listing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   whenver the ordering is not well-defined (e.g. if you have properties<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   declared in extensions…then you need to order it yourself)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     // <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise(text=&quot;Example&quot;,barData=,fooData)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   - `text=&quot;Example&quot;` =&gt; memberwise init has text=&quot;Example&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   - `barData=` =&gt; memberwise init has `barData` w/out default<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   - `fooData` =&gt; memberwise init has `fooData` w/default if it has one<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   …and e.g. the above would make:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   memberwise init(...)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   ...expand-to:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     // <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   init(text:String = &quot;Example&quot;, barData: Bar, fooData:Foo?=nil)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   ...and with the @memberwise declaration supporting a `...` for `super`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   placement, like so:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   // superclass members come before:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise(...,)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise(...,$parameterList)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   // superclass members come after      <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise(,...)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise($parameterList,...)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   ...perhaps with tweaked syntax (`@memberwise(...,$)` or `@memberwise(...,self)`)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   to be bit easier to read when you don&#39;t have an explicit parameter list?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ...which of course potentially only-further complicates the feature in some ways, but avoids having this use of this feature *necessarily* impact how one might choose to order declarations?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jan 6, 2016, at 4:47 PM, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The review of &quot;Flexible Memberwise Initialization&quot; begins now and runs through January 10th.

So far I don’t think any of those add enough value over current state to be worth considering.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; For (a) my sense is that although I can understand why you don’t want to even provide the option of specifying an explicit memberwise-parameter list, it really does seem that supporting at least an optional list makes it possible to get a lot more functionality for not much more *actual* complexity; this isn’t incompatible with also supporting an “automatic” option that uses the logic from the proposal where possible.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; In terms of (a), I definitely agree that it would be desirable to allow for a bit more functionality.  That is why I have suggested several enhancements.  I don’t think we want all of them, but some are definitely desirable.  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Chris really wanted to start with a core proposal and evaluate the enhancements independently, which is a good idea but also makes the proposal slightly less flexible than desirable.  The enhancements I feel are most important are:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 1. We need a way to specify a default value for memberwise parameters for `let` properties.<br>&gt;&gt; 2. We need a little bit more control over which properties participate in memberwise initialization when the “automatic” rules don’t quite do the right thing for a particular use case.  I think allowing distinct access control for `init` is the best way to handle this.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; You mention specifying an explicit parameter list but don’t really elaborate further.  Would the opt-in model described in the proposal meet what you have in mind?  Or are you also consider with parameter order being independent of property declaration order?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I included a mock syntax in my initial response but it was (a) at the end and (b) perhaps a bit too terse. I have put a restated sketch at the bottom of this response.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Your example below hints at general parameter forwarding.  I’ll elaborate further down.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Here’s a concrete example to illustrate why I’m harping on this point; I apologize for the length, but I think “small-n” examples can often give false intuition into how things will behave in real life:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Thank you for this!

Your `private(set)` members would now become eligible for memberwise initialization in an `internal` initializer because `init` has a distinct access level which defaults to `internal`.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Indeed, but please do note that I’d still like:<br>&gt; - `initialData` instead of `currentData`<br>&gt; - a non-nil `interactionDelegate` at init<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That said, I feel that e.g. for any variable declaration syntax something like  `private(set) internal(init=initialData) var currentData: ModelData` would be best avoided, even if it’d buy me the ability to customize the name in the synthesized memberwise init; it’s just too much and IMHO sets a bad precedent.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;     <br>&gt;&gt;     required memberwise init(...) {<br>&gt;&gt;       // synthesized stuff is effectively here<br>&gt;&gt;       super.init()<br>&gt;&gt;       // only non-assignment logic in the entire init:<br>&gt;&gt;       self.collectionView.dataSource = self<br>&gt;&gt;       self.collectionView.delegate = self<br>&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Now suppose that stored-properties-in-extensions hits (as the &quot;partial-init&quot; flavor); in that case I’d ideally be able to move some of the parts into their own files like so:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; // in `FancyCollectionViewDriver+Analytics.swift`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; extension FancyCollectionViewDriver  {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   // ^ depending on advances in the protocol system, at some point may <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   //   evolve into a protocol-adoption to get useful default implementations<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   let analyticsReporter: AnalyticsReporter <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   // ^ moved here, not in main declaration<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   //   assume also a bunch of private state-tracking stuff...<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   // a bunch of things like this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   func reportEventTypeA(eventAInfo: EventAInfo)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   func reportEventTypeB(eventBInfo: BventAInfo)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; // in `FancyCollectionViewDriver+Interaction.swift`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; extension FancyCollectionViewDriver {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   private(set) var interactionDelegate: DriverDelegateProtocol?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   // ^ moved here, not in main declaration<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   //   assume also a bunch of private state-tracking stuff...<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   // a bunch of things like this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   func handleInteractionA(interactionAInfo: InteractionAInfo)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   func handleInteractionB(interactionBInfo: InteractionBInfo)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; …(and so on for e.g. the `imageBroker` also), but under the current proposal this would put them outside the scope of a memberwise init (this isn’t news to you, I’m just making it concrete).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; So in this scenario, we’re either reapproaching the MxN problem memberwise-init is meant to avoid:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; init(<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   // still save some boilerplate:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   …, <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   imageBroker: ImageBroker,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   analyticsReporter: AnalyticsReporter, <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   initialData: ModelData, <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   interactionDelegate: DriverDelegateProtocol) {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   // some boilerplate synththesized here...<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   // ...but getting closer to where we started:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   self.partial_init(imageBroker: imageBroker)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   self.partial_init(analyticsReporter: analyticsReporter)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   self.currentData = modelData<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   self.partial_init(interactionDelegate: interactionDelegate)  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   super.init()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   self.collectionView.dataSource = self<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   self.collectionView.delegate = self<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; …or we’re making choices between taking full-advantage of properties-in-extensions (which IMHO would often be a *huge* readability win) versus taking full-advantage of boilerplate-reduction in our inits.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; If extensions with stored properties are going to properly encapsulate their state (I believe this is the way to go) they are going to have to initialize state on their own and the primary initializer will have to provide arguments the initializer requires.  Allowing stored properties in extensions automatically appear in a memberwise initializer violates that encapsulation.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &quot;Automatic appearance&quot; would definitely be bad; it’d seem like using such extensions would have to get you disqualified for automatic synthesis.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It’s still a tricky point though given the uncertainty about future directions; there seems to be some discussion of allowing protocols to define (instead of merely require) stored properties, which would perhaps be yet-another wrinkle to have to at least consider.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The good news is that a general parameter forwarding mechanism can help if the extension init (or super init) requires a bunch of arguments and you just want to forward them from your caller.  This is alluded to in the enhancement section of the proposal but is really a completely general and orthogonal feature.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; It might look something like this:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; memberwise init(…superArgs, …partial1args, …partial2args, …memberwise) {<br>&gt;&gt; 	extension1.init(directArgument: 42, …partial1args)<br>&gt;&gt; 	extension2.init(…partial2args)<br>&gt;&gt; 	super.init(…superArgs)<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; A couple things to note about how this might work:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 1. The initializer calls (or function / method calls in other cases) must be unambiguous from the code alone.<br>&gt;&gt; 2. Any parameters for which a direct argument is not provided are “captured” by the `…identifier` placeholder. <br>&gt;&gt; 3. Parameters matching those captured by the identifier are synthesized in the location specified in the parameter list.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Obviously this won’t help if the extensions only require a single argument.  But if you have extensions requiring several arguments that you want to pass through it would help<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Which is ultimately why I suspect that the “right&quot; version of the proposed feature should cut to the chase and incorporate some way to explicitly-specify the memberwise parameter list — which, again, need not be incompatible with the ability to request automatic synthesis using logic ~ what’s in the proposal — as such an explicit list takes the pressure off of getting the default behavior as-right-as-possible while also making it simpler to support some very nice-to-have capabilities not supported by this proposal as-written.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; How would this be different than the opt-in model described in the proposal?  Do you have something specific in mind?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This is what I had in the original. To expand what I meant a bit:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - you’d a type into “memberwise&quot; by including `@memberwise` somewhere in the declaration<br>&gt; - `@memberwise` can be used two ways:<br>&gt;   - “bare&quot; `@memberwise` =&gt; try to use the automatic approach (~ the logic in this proposal, or similar)<br>&gt;   - `@memberwise($parameterList)`, for explicit lists<br>&gt; <br>&gt; …with some examples for the $parameterList in a second.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Assume a class like so:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class Example {<br>&gt;   let foo: Foo<br>&gt;   var bar: Bar = Bar.standard<br>&gt;   var baz: Baz = Baz.standard<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Then here are some @memberwise declarations:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; @memberwise =&gt; init(foo: Foo, bar: Bar = Bar.standard, baz: Baz = Baz.standard)<br>&gt; // ^ automatic, roughly ~ proposal<br>&gt; <br>&gt; @memberwise(foo,bar,baz) =&gt; same as above<br>&gt; // ^ explicit, but identical<br>&gt; <br>&gt; @memberwise(foo,baz,bar) =&gt; init(foo: Foo, baz: Baz = Baz.standard, bar: Bar = Bar.standard)<br>&gt; // ^ explicit, but reordered arguments<br>&gt; <br>&gt; @memberwise(foo,bar=Foo.funkyAlternative,baz)  =&gt; init(foo: Foo, bar: Bar = Bar.funkyAlternative, baz: Baz = Baz.standard)<br>&gt; // ^ explicit, alternate default for `bar`<br>&gt; <br>&gt; @memberwise(foo,bar=,baz)  =&gt; init(foo: Foo, bar: Bar, baz: Baz = Baz.standard)<br>&gt; // ^ explicit, suppress default for `bar`<br>&gt; // …”suppression&quot; syntax isn’t great but it would seemingly work...<br>&gt; <br>&gt; @memberwise(foo=Foo.common,bar,baz)  =&gt; init(foo: Foo = Foo.common, bar: Bar = Bar.standard, baz: Baz = Baz.standard)<br>&gt; // ^ explicit, provide default for the `let`-property `foo`<br>&gt; <br>&gt; …and perhaps even the ugly-but-serviceable renaming support like:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; @memberwise(foo,bar,baz as initialBaz=) =&gt; init(foo: Foo, bar: Bar = Bar.standard, initialBaz: Baz)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; …but not sure how to have a non-awful syntax for the case where you want to “promote” a property that’s internally optional to the non-optional case (or vice-versa I guess, or some more-general not-the-same type; that may be out-of-scope).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Note that something like the above would also offer a natural way to handle superclass initialization:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; @memberwise(…,$parameterList) =&gt; this type’s parameters come *after* parent classes’ (memberwise) parameters<br>&gt; @memberwise($parameterList, ..) =&gt; this type’s parameters come *before* parent classes’ (memberwise) parameters<br>&gt; <br>&gt; …although I’m not sure how often that’d come up in practice.<br></p><p>I explored inheritance quite a bit early on in the proposal.  Chris convinced me that the right way to handle this is through a general parameter forwarding mechanism.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; This is not a concrete proposal; it’s just a sketch of how an explicit parameter-list could be designed to still support the automatic approach when possible. I’m assuming that it’s a compiler error to have an explicit list that is either (a) incomplete or (b) has any invalid/unrecognized property names.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It also feels weird to have an @-style annotation *inside* a type, so there’s a lot of room to improve the proposed syntax.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; And all the other arguments against the explicit list would also still apply, of course.<br></p><p>Are you suggesting that this attribute would be applied to a specific initializer?  Or would this be shared by all memberwise initializers of the type in some way?<br></p><p>I don’t think applying this to a specific initializer gains enough over just writing the initializer manually to be worthwhile.  If we were going to do something specific to a single initializer, something along the lines of David’s suggestion makes the most sense to me.<br></p><p>On the other hand, if you are suggesting something type-wide that would be shared by all memberwise initializers, this is really an alternate way to accomplish an opt-in model.  Rather than applying an attribute to properties you would have a declaration specify which properties are included in memberwise initializers, with the ability to specify order, labels, and defaults if necessary.  <br></p><p>That might be a reasonable syntax for an opt-in model.  As noted in the proposal, an opt-in model could be added by a future enhancement and would be used in place of the automatic model if the opt-in syntax was present.<br></p><p>Matthew<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; That’s my 2c; thanks to anyone who’s read through all this and thanks again for drafting a concrete-enough proposal to discuss properly.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Thanks for all your feedback and your example!

My understanding is that the extension will need to initialize its own properties, either with an initial value or with a `partial init`.  Designated initializers would be required to call the `partial init` for any extension that defines one.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This being the case, memberwise initialization would not directly interact with this feature at all.  Memberwise initializers declared in the main body of type itself would only expose stored properties defined in the type itself.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It would also be possible to support `partial memberwise init` in extensions which would expose the stored properties declared in the extension as part of a partial initializer.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don’t think there are difficult complications here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Secondly, I’m a bit unsure how this will interact with e.g. the property-behavior proposal if both wind up ratified. For `lazy`, the interaction with `memberwise` is easy — it is omitted from the list — but when you get into e.g. something like a hypothetical `logged` or `synchronized` or `atomic` — wherein there is custom behavior, but the field would still need initialization — you’d want them to be included in the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `memberwise` init.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My thought here is that a behavior would define whether a property allows and / or requires initialization in phase 1 or not.  This is probably necessary independent of memberwise initialization.  Properties that allow or require phase 1 initialization would be eligible for memberwise initialization. Properties that don’t allow phase 1 initialization would not be eligible for memberwise initialization.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s a bit unfair to bring up another proposal, but this proposal and something like the property-behavior proposal *would* need to work well together (if both are approved).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Agreed.  That is why there is a rule that references property behaviors in the proposal.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thirdly, I’m not sure what the current plans are (if any) for users to be able to specify the precise memory-layout of a struct; apologies if this is already a feature, I simply haven’t looked into it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Today**: I order stored-field declarations for ease-of-reading (e.g. grouped into logical groups, and organized for ease-of-reading).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Under Proposal**: I sometimes will get to choose between the “ease-of-reading” declaration ordering and the “cleanest-reading memberwise init” declaration ordering. These may not always be identical.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Agree.  This is something that could be addressed in a future enhancement if necessary.  This proposal is focused on the basic mechanism.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, nothing in the proposal prevents you from continuing to write a manual initializer when the synthesized initializer will not do what you require.  If you are already explicitly restating the property identifiers to specify parameter order you are already half way to a manual initializer implementation.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Granted, if you need more than one memberwise initializer you would have to duplicate that effort.  But re-ordering is going to have a hard time providing enough value if the basic feature does what we need in the majority of cases.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Future?**: I may have to choose between the “ease-of-reading” declaration ordering, the “cleanest-reading member wise init” declaration ordering, and (perhaps?) the “intended memory-layout” declaration ordering.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don’t want to make this proposal more-complicated than it already is, but I worry a bit about having too many things impacting the choice of how to order declarations in source files; it may be better to include a way to explicitly declare the ordering-for-memberwise:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; E.G., some way of explicitly indicating the memberwise ordering, perhaps like this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   // syntax example re-using `ComplicatedClass`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   class ComplicatedClass  {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     @memberwise($parameterList)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     // ^ can use just @memberwise to get default ordering + the defaults from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   the property declarations, but perhaps require the explicit listing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   whenver the ordering is not well-defined (e.g. if you have properties<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   declared in extensions…then you need to order it yourself)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     // <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise(text=&quot;Example&quot;,barData=,fooData)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   - `text=&quot;Example&quot;` =&gt; memberwise init has text=&quot;Example&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   - `barData=` =&gt; memberwise init has `barData` w/out default<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   - `fooData` =&gt; memberwise init has `fooData` w/default if it has one<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   …and e.g. the above would make:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   memberwise init(...)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   ...expand-to:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     // <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   init(text:String = &quot;Example&quot;, barData: Bar, fooData:Foo?=nil)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   ...and with the @memberwise declaration supporting a `...` for `super`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   placement, like so:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   // superclass members come before:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise(...,)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise(...,$parameterList)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   // superclass members come after      <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise(,...)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   @memberwise($parameterList,...)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   ...perhaps with tweaked syntax (`@memberwise(...,$)` or `@memberwise(...,self)`)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     //   to be bit easier to read when you don&#39;t have an explicit parameter list?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ...which of course potentially only-further complicates the feature in some ways, but avoids having this use of this feature *necessarily* impact how one might choose to order declarations?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jan 6, 2016, at 4:47 PM, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The review of &quot;Flexible Memberwise Initialization&quot; begins now and runs through January 10th.

Or would this be shared by all memberwise initializers of the type in some way?<br></p><p>I meant it as a type-level declaration.<br></p><p>The mental model here is that in many cases, a type with multiple public initializers winds up (or at least should wind up) like this:<br></p><p>- there’s a common “package” comprised of:<br>  - the input parameters (e.g. init args)<br>  - the boilerplate assignments (in the init)<br>- each init has some additional parameters/logic not shared with the other<br></p><p>For another example, this is lightly-adapted from actual code:<br></p><p>class PlayerItemWrapper : NSObject {<br>  let previewInfo: PreviewInfo<br>  let itemDescriptor: ItemDescriptor<br>  let metricCollector: MetricCollector<br>  let playerItem: AVPlayerItem<br></p><p>  // assume trivial assignments followed by observation-setup logic:<br>  required init(previewInfo: PreviewInfo, itemDescriptor: ItemDescriptor, metricCollector: MetricCollector, playerItem: AVPlayerItem)<br></p><p>  // these exist for convenience only; we have them b/c we don’t want to directly use<br>  // the corresponding AVPlayerItem convenience methods, since we also want to<br>  // control some of automatically loaded keys (etc.)<br>  convenience init(previewInfo: PreviewInfo, itemDescriptor: ItemDescriptor, metricCollector: MetricCollector, asset: AVAsset)<br>  convenience init(previewInfo: PreviewInfo, itemDescriptor: ItemDescriptor, metricCollector: MetricCollector, assetURL: NSURL)<br>  convenience init(previewInfo: PreviewInfo, itemDescriptor: ItemDescriptor, metricCollector: MetricCollector, assetDescriptor: AssetDescriptor)<br>}<br></p><p>…where you can easily see these inits have the structure of a “common package” + per-init details.<br></p><p>Under the organization above, it then makes sense to me to have a type-level declaration that is able to declare that type’s “official” common package, which would let the above be condensed into something like:<br></p><p>class PlayerItemWrapper : NSObject {<br>  @memberwise(previewInfo, itemDescriptor, metricCollector)<br>  // ^ need to be explicit here to *omit* playerItem, unless we<br>  //   also plan to immediately have an @nomemberwise declaration<br>  //   we can apply to individual properties<br>  let previewInfo: PreviewInfo<br>  let itemDescriptor: ItemDescriptor<br>  let metricCollector: MetricCollector<br>  let playerItem: AVPlayerItem<br></p><p>  // assume trivial assignments followed by observation-setup logic:<br>  memberwise required init(..., playerItem: AVPlayerItem)<br></p><p>  // these exist for convenience only (and would need a way to forward the … <br>  // to the required init, e.g. `self.init(…, playerItem: _)`, which is seems to be<br>  // noted as a future direction in the current proposal<br>  memberwise convenience init(…, asset: AVAsset)<br>  memberwise convenience init(..., assetURL: NSURL)<br>  memberwise convenience init(..., assetDescriptor: AssetDescriptor)<br>}<br></p><p>…and because writing out such parameter lists explicitly is a bit of a pain, the hope is that it’d also be possible to simply write e.g. @memberwise w/out an explicit list and get some automatically-inferred list synthesized on your behalf wherever possible.<br></p><p>Hope this clears up the kind of thing I was trying to sketch earlier. It is at a different point in the flexibility/feature spectrum for sure, and not thought-through too thoroughly either.<br></p><p>I also made a significant earlier error: it shouldn’t be an error if some @memberwise’s $parameterList was *incomplete*, the only error is if it contains invalid/unrecognized names.<br></p><p>&gt; I don’t think applying this to a specific initializer gains enough over just writing the initializer manually to be worthwhile.  If we were going to do something specific to a single initializer, something along the lines of David’s suggestion makes the most sense to me.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; On the other hand, if you are suggesting something type-wide that would be shared by all memberwise initializers, this is really an alternate way to accomplish an opt-in model.  Rather than applying an attribute to properties you would have a declaration specify which properties are included in memberwise initializers, with the ability to specify order, labels, and defaults if necessary.  <br></p><p>This is what I meant, essentially. An explicit @memberwise as per the above saves minimal effort if you had to do it on a per-init basis, but in scenarios with a bunch of basic parameters + various convenience inits for the remaining parameters it could still be a net win.<br></p><p>&gt; That might be a reasonable syntax for an opt-in model.  As noted in the proposal, an opt-in model could be added by a future enhancement and would be used in place of the automatic model if the opt-in syntax was present.<br></p><p>If this goes anywhere I am hoping someone will improve the syntax, actually, what I sketched seems clunky and non-idiomatic.<br></p><p>In any case, having seen how this discussion has gone I think it’s safe that at least in hindsight starting from the purely-automatic/purely-inferred synthesis standpoint may ultimately have made this proposal than it needs to have been.<br></p><p>It’s a *really* good goal — I’d like to be able to get the memberwise init synthesized automatically where possible! — and I think within the design constraints you’ve been working under it may not be possible to do it that much better than as per your proposal…but I think the conclusion here is that “it seemed plausible to extend the memberwise-init synthesis like this, but if you work through it in enough detail to make it concrete, it has a surprising amount of intrinsic complexity/inference rules/edge-cases to worry about”.<br></p><p>That’s my overall 2c here (along with what’s in the earlier emails).<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160109/d084f55d/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/831ba6eb600af4a6587f263373921bb2?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0018 Flexible Memberwise Initialization</strong> from <string>Tino Heth</string> &lt;2th at gmx.de&gt;<p>January  7, 2016 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>-1<br>It adds a lot of stuff to the language that doesn&#39;t pay off enough.<br>There are already many concepts that are very specific and useful only for init, and it should be avoided to add more.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>Definitely yes, but the imho most important thing (initial values for constants) will require even more additional syntax, as it isn&#39;t covered yet.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>You will know better, but hope for bigger ambitions ;-)<br></p><p>&gt; 	* If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>That is the source of my major objection:<br>The proposal is ok, but it makes initialization even more complicated — for me, this would destroy the last advantage Swift has over other languages (Scala, Kotlin...) in this area.<br>Other approaches are imho superior in every single aspect, and even if they are not &quot;swifty&quot; enough to get incorporated, their performance should be our reference value.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review?

Allowing an instance member to be optimized away when initialized with a constant value enables it to be referenced with convenient syntax due to implicit `self`.  It would have never occurred to me to make a true constant value an instance property, but apparently this is a common practice.  And with a guaranteed optimization is makes sense to take advantage of the implicit `self`.  <br></p><p>At the same time, IMO the inability to provide a default value for a property that is only used when it is not initialized manually is a more important issue.  I wish the “inline initializer” worked this way.  <br></p><p>I know the implementation would be a bit more complex - the compiler would have to analyze the body of non-memberwise initializers before synthesizing the inline-initialization if necessary.  But it already emits an “uninitialized member” error message so it already knows which properties are initialized and which are not.  That information may not be available in the right part of the compiler but we do not how to determine this.<br></p><p>This would solve the init / assign problem for `var` and the no overridable default problem for `let` in both existing and memberwise initializers.  It would also mean that memberwise initializers can work this way while still being pure sugar for code that can be written manually.  Unfortunately this seems like something that is not open for change.<br></p><p>Matthew<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160107/55e365a7/attachment-0001.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8083ad16248b8c031cc10d44f47aa442?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0018 Flexible Memberwise Initialization</strong> from <string>T.J.

I think it should be deferred in search of a more generic solution, perhaps to be resurrected if the search for generality fails.<br></p><p>I appreciate the tremendous care that has obviously gone into the proposal. The dual attention to use cases and corner cases is admirable. The proposal present a thorough understanding of the problem that includes considerations I certainly hadn’t thought of!<br></p><p>Still, I can’t shake unease about the proposed solution. As I read the examples, they’re not quite self-explanatory: a lot of magic, but the result doesn’t feel quite magical. Without being able to see what the compiler synthesizes, it’s often not obvious what will happen. As I read the detailed rules, they all sound quite sensible, but taken together feel like they’ll be hard to keep track of, and will lead to a lot of frustrated experimenting with the compiler. Tricky questions lurk all over. For example, what happens when I have a 7-member struct, all 7 parameters use memberwise initialization, but then I want to add some custom logic for the initialization of member 3? I think I have to either reorder the params or abandon … altogether? I feel like those tricky questions should melt away once I grasp the underlying principle, but there isn’t one to grasp; it’s just a bunch of tricky cases.<br></p><p>On reflection, it comes down to this: the feature to functionality ratio is too high.<br></p><p>That probably requires some explanation. By “feature,” I mean a specific behavior the software implements for which users will need a mental model. By “functionality,” I mean the set of things one can do with the software, and more importantly the nature of the user’s experience doing them.<br></p><p>An example of a high feature/functionality payoff is Swift’s as-if-immutable structs. There’s a fairly large set of relevant features: the let/var distinction for declarations, the “mutating” keyword, the interaction of “let” with setters and mutating methods, and the way “let” recursively affects structs inside of structs. However, all of that folds into a mental model with a nice unifying principle: Swift structs behave semantically as if they are all always immutable and mutations create a new struct and reassign it to the variable; however, they perform better than that, because the compiler will optimize that into a direct mutation when possible. The features pay huge functionality dividends across a wide variety of situations: defensive programming, passing data across threads, isolating responsibility … it goes on.<br></p><p>(Really, “functionality” is a qualitative thing, more about the experience than just “what can I do,” and so talking about the “feature to functionality ratio” is only a metaphorical gesture. It captures the right feeling, though.)<br></p><p>In this proposal, there’s a similarly large set of new features: the “memberwise” keyword, the new use of …, multiple interacting rules about memberwise property eligibility, synthesized initialization, rules about how that interacts with manual initialization. For all that, though, the functionality gain is limited: we shed some senseless repetition — that’s good! — but only for copying of parameters to properties, only when they’re in the same order, and only in initializers.<br></p><p>The proposal reads like a set of specific use cases translated directly into specific features, without a good eye to the bigger picture.<br></p><p>It feels to me like this functionality should come from a feature set that is more general, more arbitrarily composable, and pays greater dividends in a wider variety of situations. As a simple example, what if I want to write an updateFrom(other: Self) method that does a mass copy of all properties? Why doesn’t this proposal help with that, too? Because the … placeholder and the synthesized copying are tightly coupled (1) to each other and (2) to initialization.<br></p><p>I’m not sure what the better answer is, but it’s out there. I didn’t follow the whole discussion, but I did notice Joe Groff’s proposal for a Members tuple; that seems to me to be getting much warmer. I’d much prefer something along those lines, even if it were slightly more verbose.<br></p><p>(Aside, a small nitpick, but it really bugs me: initialization has O(M+N) complexity, not O(M×N) complexity. One doesn’t initialize every member with every parameter.)<br></p><p><br>Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>It’s certainly worth considering. Mindless parameter copying is a source of low-value verbosity, and can lead to errors.<br></p><p><br>Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>It does in that it aims to reduce developer error and verbosity by providing an idiom to solve a common problem.<br></p><p>It does not in that the idiom is so narrow. The language is moving away from that in other realms (e.g. lazy).<br></p><p><br>If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>I’ve never heard of a language with such a high specialized tool for doing just this.<br></p><p>Ruby and Javascript allow programmatic traversal of both arguments and properties, and provide enough reflection to automate that. Developers in both languages do write ad hoc solutions to do almost exactly what this proposal does, though they’re not widely used. The most common is probably variations on this:<br></p><p>def initialize(**args)<br>  args.each do |prop, value|<br>    obj.send(&quot;#{prop}=&quot;, value)<br>  end<br>end<br></p><p>…which uses key/value pairs from an argument array to set properties.<br></p><p>Being able to convert arguments to a dictionary is something Swift certainly might investigate.<br></p><p><br>How much effort did you put into your review?

This proposal effectively fleshes that feature out giving it more functionality.  The only fundamental complexity it adds is the access control rules, which I feel are pretty important to enforce.<br></p><p><br>&gt; <br>&gt; That probably requires some explanation. By “feature,” I mean a specific behavior the software implements for which users will need a mental model. By “functionality,” I mean the set of things one can do with the software, and more importantly the nature of the user’s experience doing them.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; An example of a high feature/functionality payoff is Swift’s as-if-immutable structs. There’s a fairly large set of relevant features: the let/var distinction for declarations, the “mutating” keyword, the interaction of “let” with setters and mutating methods, and the way “let” recursively affects structs inside of structs. However, all of that folds into a mental model with a nice unifying principle: Swift structs behave semantically as if they are all always immutable and mutations create a new struct and reassign it to the variable; however, they perform better than that, because the compiler will optimize that into a direct mutation when possible. The features pay huge functionality dividends across a wide variety of situations: defensive programming, passing data across threads, isolating responsibility … it goes on.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; (Really, “functionality” is a qualitative thing, more about the experience than just “what can I do,” and so talking about the “feature to functionality ratio” is only a metaphorical gesture. It captures the right feeling, though.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In this proposal, there’s a similarly large set of new features: the “memberwise” keyword, the new use of …, multiple interacting rules about memberwise property eligibility, synthesized initialization, rules about how that interacts with manual initialization. For all that, though, the functionality gain is limited: we shed some senseless repetition — that’s good! — but only for copying of parameters to properties, only when they’re in the same order, and only in initializers.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The proposal reads like a set of specific use cases translated directly into specific features, without a good eye to the bigger picture.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It feels to me like this functionality should come from a feature set that is more general, more arbitrarily composable, and pays greater dividends in a wider variety of situations. As a simple example, what if I want to write an updateFrom(other: Self) method that does a mass copy of all properties? Why doesn’t this proposal help with that, too? Because the … placeholder and the synthesized copying are tightly coupled (1) to each other and (2) to initialization.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I’m not sure what the better answer is, but it’s out there. I didn’t follow the whole discussion, but I did notice Joe Groff’s proposal for a Members tuple; that seems to me to be getting much warmer. I’d much prefer something along those lines, even if it were slightly more verbose.<br></p><p>I think the direction suggested by Joe (and Dave) is interesting.  But they haven’t explained how it would handle some important use cases this proposal addresses (default parameter values, subset of members without using a struct, etc).  If we are going to reject this proposal in hope of a more general solution I would at least like to see a path forward that might be able to address these use cases.<br></p><p>More importantly, the general features on their own would not address the problems addressed by this proposal.  There would still need to be initializer-specific magic.  Joe hinted at what that might be but has not fleshed out all the details yet.  Maybe it would be a simpler model but we would need to see more specific details.<br></p><p>I don’t believe a fully generalized solution is possible.  There are a lot of initialization-specific constraints that must be met (definitive initialization, single initialization of `let` properties, etc).<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; (Aside, a small nitpick, but it really bugs me: initialization has O(M+N) complexity, not O(M×N) complexity. One doesn’t initialize every member with every parameter.)<br></p><p>MxN is members x initializers.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It’s certainly worth considering. Mindless parameter copying is a source of low-value verbosity, and can lead to errors.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It does in that it aims to reduce developer error and verbosity by providing an idiom to solve a common problem.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It does not in that the idiom is so narrow. The language is moving away from that in other realms (e.g. lazy).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I’ve never heard of a language with such a high specialized tool for doing just this.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Ruby and Javascript allow programmatic traversal of both arguments and properties, and provide enough reflection to automate that. Developers in both languages do write ad hoc solutions to do almost exactly what this proposal does, though they’re not widely used. The most common is probably variations on this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; def initialize(**args)<br>&gt;   args.each do |prop, value|<br>&gt;     obj.send(&quot;#{prop}=&quot;, value)<br>&gt;   end<br>&gt; end<br>&gt; <br>&gt; …which uses key/value pairs from an argument array to set properties.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Being able to convert arguments to a dictionary is something Swift certainly might investigate.<br></p><p>We should have a safe solution that allows the compiler to enforce type checking and definitive initialization rules.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; How much effort did you put into your review?

This proposal effectively fleshes that feature out giving it more functionality.  The only fundamental complexity it adds is the access control rules, which I feel are pretty important to enforce.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The struct memberwise behavior today is really simple and doesn’t expose a public API allowing for non-exhaustive behavior requirements and a much simpler design.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The struct rule is basically this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; A member is added to the initializer when the following conditions are true:<br>&gt;     1. The member is not declared with let and an initialization value<br>&gt;     2. The member is not a computed property<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Also, this generated initializer is only generated when no other init() has been defined.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The really important observation though is that it keeps the generated initializer private, which means that there are no real API contracts to consider as it can only be used within your own code. It’s a nicety to have when simply building up some code to solve a problem.<br></p><p>Actually it is internal, not private, and it exposes private properties via that internal initializer.

My main concern is the complexity of the rules, especially when looking at the direction many of the futures take. There are all of these annotations that get put all over that litter the type<br>&gt;&gt; definition simply to support memberwise inits.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Maybe I wasn’t clear enough, but I never intended for all of them to be accepted.  They are intended to show different ways to allow a bit more control.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The proposal only changes current state in a few ways:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1. Allow the memberwise initializer to be used in classes<br>&gt; 2. Allow default parameter values for `var` properties<br>&gt; 3. Fix the problem the current memberwise initializer has with lazy properties<br>&gt; 4. Use the `set` rather than `get` visibility for `var` properties<br>&gt; 5. Allow you to request the memberwise initializer, including:<br>&gt; 	i. Specify access level, which will result in omission of memberwise parameters for more-private properties<br>&gt; 	ii. Add additional parameters<br>&gt; 	iii. include an initializer body<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Are there specific changes in this list that you dislike?<br></p><p>No, I think you’re goal is reasonable and your proposal is well thought out. The problem comes down to the details on how to support it. Each point has a set of gotcha’s that require rules to handle properly. <br></p><p>It’s simply my opinion that these rules make the feature far too complicated.<br></p><p>You could go super basic and just have the proposal help address the struct scenario and have the default value for “var” members carried through to the implicitly created init(). <br></p><p>&gt;&gt; I think it keeps coming up because it’s far simpler. While there is duplication in the type signature, the code is still smaller, more flexible, and more applicable than being limited to only initialization. Further, and I think this is what is far more important, I only need to look at single place to understand what is going on with initialization for any particular call. I don’t need to find out what members are annotated, or create the list of head of members and exclude certain ones if @nomemberize() is used. Each member being initialized as a configuration entity from the user is right there, no questions asked.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; How is this more applicable than just for initialization?  Are you suggesting a self parameter be allowed in any method and it would result in an immediate set of that property?<br></p><p>Yes, I’m suggesting that “self” is a qualifier, like “inout”.<br></p><p>This code:<br></p><p>struct Point {<br>    var x, y, z: Int<br>    init(self x: Int, self y: Int = 0, self z: Int = 0) {}<br>    func foo(self x: Int) {}<br>}<br></p><p>Would be identical to this code:<br></p><p>struct Point {<br>    var x, y, z: Int<br>    init(x: Int, y: Int = 0, z: Int = 0) {<br>        self.x = x; self.y = y; self.z = z;<br>        // rest of function<br>    }<br></p><p>    func foo(x: Int) {<br>        self.x = x<br>        // rest of function<br>    }<br>}<br></p><p>That assignment happens before the function body executes.<br></p><p>This model fixes the majority of my complexity issues. However, it brings some others to the table and doesn’t solve the need to duplicate all of the members in the API.<br></p><p>I think something like this was mentioned before, but I don’t remember what happened with it. However, another way to do initialization could be like this (C# calls this field initializers):<br></p><p>	let p = Point {<br>        x = 12,<br>        y = 13,<br>        z = 14<br>    }<br></p><p>We then get out of caring about the ordering of the parameters. However, this feature is much more narrow as it only applies to public properties. There is a lot of subtly in actually implementing this in the compiler though.<br></p><p><br>&gt; I really appreciate the feedback and conversation.  I am continuing to think about all of the comments and am hoping we can come out of this review with a vision for a path forward that makes most people happy whether the proposal is accepted or not.  (I think it’s clear that no solution will make everyone happy but do hope we can hit a sweet spot)<br></p><p>Just to be clear, I think the proposal lays out the land well and has good coverage of the issues. I just find it too complicated of a ruleset to need to know.<br></p><p>-David<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160108/8a2adf17/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecdb231117dda838340bfcbb8873d28e?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0018 Flexible Memberwise Initialization</strong> from <string>Paul Cantrell</string> &lt;cantrell at pobox.com&gt;<p>January  8, 2016 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jan 8, 2016, at 11:31 AM, Matthew Johnson &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jan 8, 2016, at 11:03 AM, Paul Cantrell via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I can’t shake unease about the proposed solution.

It’s a lot of hidden rules.<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; It feels to me like this functionality should come from a feature set that is more general, more arbitrarily composable, and pays greater dividends in a wider variety of situations. As a simple example, what if I want to write an updateFrom(other: Self) method that does a mass copy of all properties? Why doesn’t this proposal help with that, too? Because the … placeholder and the synthesized copying are tightly coupled (1) to each other and (2) to initialization.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I’m not sure what the better answer is, but it’s out there. I didn’t follow the whole discussion, but I did notice Joe Groff’s proposal for a Members tuple; that seems to me to be getting much warmer. I’d much prefer something along those lines, even if it were slightly more verbose.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I think the direction suggested by Joe (and Dave) is interesting.  But they haven’t explained how it would handle some important use cases this proposal addresses (default parameter values, subset of members without using a struct, etc).  If we are going to reject this proposal in hope of a more general solution I would at least like to see a path forward that might be able to address these use cases.<br></p><p>Agreed — I think this proposal has tremendous value at the very least as an in-depth exploration of all the cases to consider in searching for a more general solution.<br></p><p>&gt; More importantly, the general features on their own would not address the problems addressed by this proposal.  There would still need to be initializer-specific magic.  Joe hinted at what that might be but has not fleshed out all the details yet.  Maybe it would be a simpler model but we would need to see more specific details.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I don’t believe a fully generalized solution is possible.  There are a lot of initialization-specific constraints that must be met (definitive initialization, single initialization of `let` properties, etc).<br></p><p>As I said in the original review, I’d be willing to sacrifice some concision in service of making the solution more general.<br></p><p>For example, the proposal goes to lengths to (1) automatically select a subset of members for memberwise initialization and (2) automatically insert the initialization code. I’d be willing to sacrifice both those implicit behaviors for some more generically composable mechanisms that let me turn a (sub)set of members into a tuple type, add it to arg lists, and mass assign it.<br></p><p>Here’s a sketch of that — not a proposal, total BS syntax, totally hypothetical:<br></p><p>    struct S {<br>        let s0, s1, s2: String<br>        private let i: Int<br></p><p>        init(anInt: Int, anotherInt: Int, otherArgs: Members.except(i)) {<br>            members = otherArgs  // assigned members inferred from tuple item names<br>            i = anInt &gt; anotherInt ? anInt : anotherInt<br>        }<br>    }<br></p><p>I’d be happy — happier! — with a solution like that, despite the modest additional keystrokes, because (1) members and Members would presumably have a more predictable behavior that’s easier to remember and to understand by reading, and (2) they’d be usable in other contexts:<br></p><p>    mutating func updateFrom(other: S) {<br>        self.members = other.except(i)<br>        i = anInt &gt; anotherInt ? anInt : anotherInt<br>    }<br></p><p>…or heck, even this:<br></p><p>    mutating func updateTwoStrings(s0: String, s1: String) {<br>        members = arguments<br>    }<br></p><p>    mutating func updateTwoStrings(s0: String, s1: String, message: String) {<br>        print(message)<br>        members = arguments.except(message)<br>    }<br></p><p>OK, I concede I&#39;m now brainstorming quite a feature list here:<br></p><p>members property that turns all (stored?) properties into a tuple,<br>Members property that returns the type of the above,<br>select / except operations on any tuple that create a new tuple by filtering keys,<br>assignment of a tuple to members that matches by tuple key (and the tuple can contain a subset of all properties),<br>some way of variadically expanding a tuple type in an arg list, and<br>arguments implicit variable that gives all func args as a tuple. (That last one’s not necessary to replace this proposal; just threw it in there because I’m brainstorming.)<br></p><p>That’s a lot! But all these feature are more independent, flexible, and transparent than the ones in the proposal. They (1) need not all be understood all at once, (2) have less implicit behavior and rules about corner cases, (3) thus have a simpler mental model and are easier to understand just by reading, and (4) provide more capabilities in a broader range of contexts.<br></p><p>Again, it’s only a sketch. Just making stuff up here! The obvious question is “how exactly would it all work,” and I don’t know either — but I feel like it could, and I’d really like to pursue this sort of direction before going with the more narrow proposal at hand.<br></p><p>That said, I originally wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; I think it should be deferred in search of a more generic solution, perhaps to be resurrected if the search for generality fails.<br></p><p><br>I said “deferred” instead of “rejected” because my objection is that there may be a better solution — but that’s only a gut feeling, and if we really truly establish that there isn’t, then I’d give this proposal another look.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; (Aside, a small nitpick, but it really bugs me: initialization has O(M+N) complexity, not O(M×N) complexity. One doesn’t initialize every member with every parameter.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; MxN is members x initializers.<br></p><p>Yes, as others pointed out, my careless misreading! Makes much more sense now.

As I read the examples, they’re not quite self-explanatory: a lot of magic, but the result doesn’t feel quite magical. Without being able to see what the compiler synthesizes, it’s often not obvious what will happen. As I read the detailed rules, they all sound quite sensible, but taken together feel like they’ll be hard to keep track of, and will lead to a lot of frustrated experimenting with the compiler. Tricky questions lurk all over. For example, what happens when I have a 7-member struct, all 7 parameters use memberwise initialization, but then I want to add some custom logic for the initialization of member 3? I think I have to either reorder the params or abandon … altogether? I feel like those tricky questions should melt away once I grasp the underlying principle, but there isn’t one to grasp; it’s just a bunch of tricky cases.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On reflection, it comes down to this: the feature to functionality ratio is too high.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Would you propose removing the current implicit memberwise initializer for structs on the same grounds?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; No, it’s a much smaller feature surface. I would proposed promoting it from a simple, situational feature to something very generic — much like what Joe Groff is doing with “lazy.”<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; This proposal effectively fleshes that feature out giving it more functionality.  The only fundamental complexity it adds is the access control rules, which I feel are pretty important to enforce.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I tend to agree with others who think the additional complexity in this proposal is substantial. Perhaps it would come to seem simple if we all lived with it, though that’s not my gut reaction. It’s a lot of hidden rules.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It feels to me like this functionality should come from a feature set that is more general, more arbitrarily composable, and pays greater dividends in a wider variety of situations. As a simple example, what if I want to write an updateFrom(other: Self) method that does a mass copy of all properties? Why doesn’t this proposal help with that, too? Because the … placeholder and the synthesized copying are tightly coupled (1) to each other and (2) to initialization.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I’m not sure what the better answer is, but it’s out there. I didn’t follow the whole discussion, but I did notice Joe Groff’s proposal for a Members tuple; that seems to me to be getting much warmer. I’d much prefer something along those lines, even if it were slightly more verbose.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I think the direction suggested by Joe (and Dave) is interesting.  But they haven’t explained how it would handle some important use cases this proposal addresses (default parameter values, subset of members without using a struct, etc).  If we are going to reject this proposal in hope of a more general solution I would at least like to see a path forward that might be able to address these use cases.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Agreed — I think this proposal has tremendous value at the very least as an in-depth exploration of all the cases to consider in searching for a more general solution.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; More importantly, the general features on their own would not address the problems addressed by this proposal.  There would still need to be initializer-specific magic.  Joe hinted at what that might be but has not fleshed out all the details yet.

Allow you to request the memberwise initializer, including:<br>&gt;&gt; 	i. Add additional parameters<br>&gt;&gt; 	ii. include an initializer body<br>&gt;&gt; 	iii. Specify access level, which will result in omission of memberwise parameters for more-private properties (it would be reasonable to limit this to private and internal if concerns about allowing it to be public are a significant factor)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I am curious to hear your thoughts on which of these points are not desirable, and what your opinion is about the existing rules for the implicit memberwise init for structs.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m happy with 1, 2, and 3 as a separate proposal, or several separate proposals. (For 1 in particular, the restriction predates the access control model, but making it implicit would also interfere with inheriting designated initializers.) I&#39;m not sure 4 is interesting enough, but sure.<br></p><p>Hmm, thought you had agreed with #4 in the discussion about that topic.

You can’t initialise lets.<br>2. You can’t initialise more-private-stored properties than the property-wise initialiser itself.<br>3. You can&#39;t label property-wise initialiser arguments.<br>4. It is not totally clear which properties are to be initialised property-wise.<br>5. The proposal adds to the existing menberwise initialisers and the default initialisers; which then means there are 4 initialisers (manual, current memberwise default, and new memberwise), therefore I would prefer a proposal that encompassed all of these.<br>6. Super types need a default initialiser.<br>7. The memberwise init does not have default values for its memberwise arguments which means that all memberwise arguments need to be specified when calling the memberwise init (like current memberwise init).<br>8. Stored properties have to be given a default value to participate in memberwise initialisation.<br>9. `memberwise` isn’t a great keyword, since funcs are also members<br>10. The … notation can be a bit invisible.<br></p><p>However I think that if the design space is opened up then these issues could be addressed. Here is a modification to the existing proposal:<br></p><p><br>1. Basic example: demonstrates a short form for C-like structs and let initialisation:<br></p><p>    // Short-property-wise form<br>    class Size2D properties { // Note: properties keyword<br>        let width = 0.0, height = 0.0 // Note: let<br>    }<br></p><p>    // Translation to long-property-wise form<br>    class Size2D {<br>        properties { // Note: obvious which properties are property-wise initialised<br>            let width = 0.0, height = 0.0<br>        } init(properties) {} // Note: placeholder, properties, for property-wise args and no init body<br>    }<br>    <br>    // Translation to basic Swift<br>    class Size2D {<br>        let width: Double<br>        let height: Double<br>        init(width: Double = 0.0, height: Double = 0.0) { // Note: default values for property-wise args<br>            self.width = width<br>            self.height = height<br>        }<br>    }<br></p><p><br>2. Example of how super is to be called.<br></p><p>    // Short-property-wise form<br>    class Size3D: Size2D properties(width: Double = 0.0, height: Double = 0.0) {<br>        let depth: Double = 0.0<br>    }<br></p><p>    // Translation to long-property-wise form<br>    class Size3D: Size2D {<br>        properties(width: Double = 0.0, height: Double = 0.0) {<br>            let depth: Double = 0.0<br>        } init(properties) {}<br>    }<br>    <br>    // Translation to basic Swift<br>    class Size3D: Size2D {<br>        let depth: Double<br>        init(width: Double = 0.0, height: Double = 0.0, depth: Double = 0.0) { // Note: super args before property-wise args<br>            self.depth = depth<br>            super.init(width: width, height: height)<br>        }<br>    }<br></p><p><br>3. More involved example with private property, properties arg label, other init, and other methods<br></p><p>    // Only long-property-wise form allowed since other methods and other initialisers required<br>    class LoggedAndScaledSize2D: Size2D {<br>        properties(width: Double = 0.0, height: Double = 0.0) {<br>            private var times scale: Double = 0.0 // Note: label, times, and private<br>        } init(properties) {}<br>        properties init(properties, logger: Logger? = nil) { // Note: only 1 property-wise init can have properties and super args<br>            logger?.log(self) // Note: rest of init<br>        }<br>        var scaledWidth: Double { // Note: other methods<br>            get { return scale * width }<br>    }<br></p><p>    // Translation to basic Swift<br>    class LoggedAndScaledSize2D: Size2D {<br>        private var scale: Double // Note: private<br>        init(width: Double = 0.0, height: Double = 0.0, times scale: Double = 0.0) { // Note: label times<br>            self.scale = scale<br>            super.init(width: width, height: height)<br>        }<br>        init(width: Double = 0.0, height: Double = 0.0, times scale: Double = 0.0, logger: Logger? = nil) {<br>            self.scale = scale<br>            super.init(width: width, height: height)<br>            logger?.log(self) // Rest of init<br>        }<br>        var scaledWidth: Double { // Other methods<br>            get { return scale * width }<br>            set { scale = newValue / width }<br>        }<br>        var scaledHeight: Double {<br>            get { return scale * height }<br>            set { scale = newValue / height }<br>        }<br>    }<br></p><p><br></p><p>4. The existing memberwise and default initialisers are deprecated.<br></p><p>Obviously the above is just a three examples - happy to flesh out details if there is interest.<br></p><p>The semantics of the proposal are as though the literal translations from short-property-wise form, to long-property-wise form, to basic Swift occurred.<br></p><p>The proposed semantics &quot;as though literal translated&quot; and previous compiler-written initialisers deprecated means that `struct Length { var length: Double = 0.0 }` is now an error - it has no initialisers. Programmer would write `struct Length properties { var length: Double = 0.0 }`, note added properties keyword.<br></p><p>Whether properties is much better than memberwise and … is open to some debate!<br></p><p>        * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>I think a revised proposal would be viable, but marginal as it stands.<br></p><p>        * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>In some ways yes (because Swift has compiler written initialisation already), but in others, like adding another way of doing initialisation, no (because one aim of the evolution is not to become a ‘kitchen-sink&#39; language like C++).<br></p><p>        * If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>Yes I have used a similar feature in Scala and the current proposal is much more complicated. The Scala solution seems better to me. But see proposed alternative above.<br></p><p>        * How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>I have kept up with the discussions and have interacted with Matthew Johnston and others on this topic. I have also discussed with Bill Venners from Escalate; who is well known as an educator in the Scala community, the Scala version it is well liked in the Scala community and is easy to teach.<br></p><p>Glad this topic is under discussion,<br></p><p> -- Howard.<br></p><p>On 7 January 2016 at 09:47, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>Hello Swift community,<br></p><p>The review of &quot;Flexible property-wise Initialization&quot; begins now and runs through January 10th.

I had genuinely good feelings about Swift from the time Apple introduced it at WWDC &#39;14. It provided software developers with many conveniences and removed a lot of complexity from its predecessor, Objective C.

However over the evolution and now review of this proposal I have become much more hesitant.<br></p><p><br>Firstly, from the discussion it has become clear that this is a hard issue to solve elegantly.<br></p><p>I mostly like the proposed syntax but it adds a lot of additional language surface with complicated semantics for ultimately limited benefit.<br>Many people (on both the +1 and -1 sides) seem to be agree that this is ultimately only a &quot;partial&quot; solution and that they would like additional capabilities. However from the proposal and the discussion it seems that those would require even more special behaviour and/or syntax, again adding a lot of additional complexity for limited usefulness.<br></p><p><br>Secondly, over the course of following this discussion I have become increasingly convinced that this is not as big an issue as I first thought.<br></p><p>At least for me it seems that the annoyance towards writing (some) initializers stems mostly from an instinctual reaction to having to perform a repetitive and menial task. Upon reflection it seems the actual mental and physical work is extremely minimal and it&#39;s mostly my annoyance at doing so that seems out of proportion. Very little of my time is ultimately spent writing trivial initialization code.<br></p><p>While these initializers are annoying to type out, it is not an error prone task. They are clear and easy to understand, requiring basically no mental overhead to &quot;parse&quot;. They can be easily refactored and adapted as needs change.<br></p><p>With the proposal as it stands I can save a few keystrokes here and there. Until my initializer needs a bit of custom work at which point I might need to write it out anyway, use increasingly obscure syntax, start reordering the types properties, etc... The various extensions to this proposal increase the number of initializers that I could &quot;simplify&quot; but at the cost of a much more complex mental model. Now I need to take into account various attributes and declarations to make my initializer(s) work the way I want.<br></p><p>Writing the initializer is something that happens once, reading it will occur many times. And while it&#39;s nice to save 50 keystrokes when writing the thing, is it worth the mental overhead required to piece it together in the future?<br></p><p>The oft mentioned alternative `init(foo: Int, bar: Int) { // implicit }` improves on some of these aspects but at that point the work saved is so small as to probably not be worth the bother.<br></p><p>Now I&#39;m not saying the answers here are clear cut but for me, for now, this proposal introduces a lot of complexity to solve a very limited subset of a not so big problem. But I&#39;d be happy to see this topic revisited in the future and this detailed and well though out proposal should definitely be the starting point for any future discussions.<br></p><p><br>&gt; * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Judging from the interest in this topic, probably yes. However it is a minor problem and the current solutions are too costly for too little benefit.<br></p><p><br>&gt; * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Syntactically mostly yes. However Swift strongly favors clarity and simplicity over conciseness and I feel this proposal has issues in that regard.<br></p><p><br>&gt; * If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>No.<br></p><p><br>&gt; * How much effort did you put into your review?

You have all given me a lot to think about.  I believe this discussion has been very productive.  It has helped to move my thinking on the topic forward and shape a more complete, more compelling vision of where we can go.<br></p><p>At a high level I think there are a few takeaways.  <br></p><p>First, there seems to be very broad (but not universal) agreement that something should be done to make trivial initialization code more concise.  The problem is worth solving.<br></p><p>Second, there is more support than opposition for this proposal, but the response is definitely mixed.  By my tally the responses are roughly:<br></p><p>55% favorable (Chris and I are both still favorable)<br>20% mixed<br>25% opposed<br></p><p>The categorization is somewhat subjective but I believe anyone who does a tally on their own will come up with reasonably similar results.<br></p><p>Third, there are some common and valid criticisms which are addressed further down below.<br></p><p>Finally, I after much vetting I still believe this proposal does a good job of fulfilling the goal it set out to do, namely improve the existing memberwise intializer by making it much more flexible.  <br></p><p>Even several of those who oppose the proposal have agreed with that.  The basis of their opposition is that once you work out the details of doing so the resulting complexity is not worth it.  <br></p><p>Personally, I believe the increase in complexity over the current implicit memberwise initializer is not as significant as some perceive and the additional flexibility more than pays for the cost of the incremental complexity.  The changes from current state can be summarized concisely as:<br></p><p>1. Allow the memberwise initializer to be used in classes<br>2. Allow default parameter values for `var` properties<br>3. Fix the problem the current memberwise initializer has with lazy properties<br>4. Use the `set` rather than `get` visibility for `var` properties<br>5. Allow you to request the memberwise initializer, including:<br>	i. Add additional parameters<br>	ii. include an initializer body<br>	iii. Specify access level, which will result in omission of memberwise parameters for more-private properties (it would be reasonable to limit this to private and internal if concerns about allowing it to be public are a significant factor)<br></p><p>The perceived complexity of this proposal focuses on the property eligibility rules.  As noted in the list above, there are only two differences in those rules under the curernt proposal compared to the existing implicit memberwise initializer: #4 and #5.iii.  In exchange for accepting those two changes this proposal gives us the increased functionality in the rest of the list.<br></p><p>Despite the proposal doing a good job of fulfilling the basic goal, there have been some very valid critiques of it:<br></p><p>1. **Complexity:** the rules of any workable automatic model are inherently nontrivial.  <br>2. **Limitations:** it isn&#39;t possible to specify an explicit list of parameters, their order, their external lablels, and default values for `let` properties.  <br>3. **Specificity:** the memberwise initialization is a very special case feature.  It would be better to have more general facilities that support the memberwise initialization use case.<br></p><p>I have been giving a lot of thought to all of them.  I espicially want to thank Dave Abrahams and Joe Groff for starting the discussion around looking for more general facilities to support memberwise initialization. <br></p><p>Ultimately, improving the existing memberwise initializer is not the best premise for a long-term solution to address the limitations of this proposal.  A solution built on more general features can be just as clear and expressive, while also serving use cases beyond memberwise initialization.<br></p><p>With all of the above in mind, my recommendation is to accept this proposal and simultaneously keep working on more general facilities that can supercede the faciilities of this proposal (aside from the imiplicit memberwise initializer).  I make this recommendation for the following reasons:<br></p><p>1. This proposal improves the implicit memberwise initializer which will not be touched by proposals for more general features adressing.<br>2. There is no guarantee that more general features addressing memberwise initialization will make it into Swift 3.  Accepting this proposal guarantees we will see improvements that I believe are worthwhile, even if they are not a final solution.<br>3. Implementation could begin with an eye on the more general approach, possibly providing a head start on implementing them.<br></p><p>I would also like to begin discussion regarding three general facilities that can work together to improve the conciseness and expressiveness of our initializers.  The combination of the first two facilities can supercede the functionality of this proposal.  I believe all three facilities working together can signficantly increase the clarity and expressiveness of our initialization code.  <br></p><p>1. Parameter forwarding: I began working on a general purpose parameter forwarding proposal prior to this review.  This feature will add clarity to various forms of chained initializers.  It will also be to any function that needs to forward a set of arguments from its caller directly to another function, not just to initializers.<br></p><p>2. Partial initializers: The idea for this proposal was inspired by thinking about Joe&#39;s example of a more general solution.  Using a setter to perform initialization (especially of `let` properties) just seems wrong to me.  What we need is a partial initializer which can be used to factor out common initialization logic.  Partial initialzers are a general purpose initialization tool, not a tool specific to memberwise initializers.  However, when combined with parameter forwarding and a few implicit partial initializers, it is possible to replace the explicit memberwise initializers described in this proposal with syntax that is just as concise.<br></p><p>3. Property lists: Property lists were inspired by two subthreads of this review.  One was Joe&#39;s idea for a computed &quot;members&quot; tuple property.  The other is all of the discussions related to limitations and lack of control in the Flexible Memberwise Initialization proposal.  Property lists are a declaration that allows a user to declare a specific set of properties, in a specific order, with specific labels and specific default parameter values.  This declaration results in a synthesized partial initializer as well as a synthesized computed tuple property.  It may also synthesize other memberwise features in the future as new ideas for them arise.  The property list enables extremely concise yet expressive declarations of memberwise partial initializers.  It is also possible to include several implicit property lists such as `members`, `vars`, `lets`, etc which would be quite similar to some of the ideas discussed in the review thread.<br></p><p>The proposal drafts can be found at the following links:<br></p><p>* Parameter forwarding: https://github.com/anandabits/swift-evolution/blob/parameter-forwarding/proposals/NNNN-parameter-forwarding.md<br>* Partial initializers: https://github.com/anandabits/swift-evolution/blob/partial-initializers/proposals/NNNN-partial-initializers.md<br>* Property lists: https://github.com/anandabits/swift-evolution/blob/property-lists/proposals/NNNN-property-lists.md<br></p><p>They contain enough detail about the proposed solution that I believe they are ready for a first round of discussion, however none are complete drafts.  I will be starting a thread for each proposal.  Please move discussion specific to each proposal into its respective thread.<br></p><p>Any discussion pertaining to memberwise intitialization, how these proposals address concerns brought up during the review, how well these proposals together provide a good long-term direction for memberwise intialization, etc can remain in one of the threads about the current proposal.<br></p><p>I want to thank you all again for participating.  I&#39;m very much looking forward to continuing the discussion.<br></p><p>Matthew<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160110/7c3d9336/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/831ba6eb600af4a6587f263373921bb2?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0018 Flexible Memberwise Initialization</strong> from <string>Tino Heth</string> &lt;2th at gmx.de&gt;<p>January 11, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>Especially after reviewing the associated proposals, I can&#39;t avoid the impression that the topic of initialization steers towards a complexity that is hard to to justify.<br>There are whole programming languages that are easier to explain than the rules that are laid out here and in the other threads — and I mean it literally:<br>Just take Scheme or Tcl as an example.<br></p><p>I already suggested to delay the decision, but now I&#39;m convinced this would be way better than to force an issue.<br>There are alternatives that have been mentioned but did not yet receive a fair treatment, and there might be better solutions no one has been talking about.<br>Initialization isn&#39;t that bad right now, so despite Matthews haste, there is imho no need to choose a solution without a neutral comparison of all options.<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c450c87df0788b8e1f7a6ca17ea34c7?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0018 Flexible Memberwise Initialization</strong> from <string>Douglas Gregor</string> &lt;dgregor at apple.com&gt;<p>January 10, 2016 at 10:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jan 6, 2016, at 2:47 PM, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>It’s a well-considered and well-written proposal. I agree with the semantics of memberwise initializers (+1 to adding a reasonable implicit memberwise initializer for classes, and the ability to use default arguments in that implicit memberwise initializer). However, I would prefer to accept the semantics as improvements to the creation of the implicit memberwise initializer, so it’s a -1 to the “memberwise” specifier and “…” placeholder syntax.<br></p><p>Separately, I’m moderately nervous about the placeholder “…” getting overloaded with future intended uses for variadic generics and tuple packing/unpacking.

The lack of default arguments in the implicit memberwise initializer comes up often as a feature request, and the lack of an implicit memberwise initializer for classes leads to a bunch of boilerplate for common use cases (particularly the “let’s create our first class” example, which needs to mention initializers far too early).<br></p><p>As for the “memberwise” specifier and placeholder syntax, I don’t think so.

The proposal is available here:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0018-flexible-memberwise-initialization.md<br></p><p>Here are some long and poorly organized notes from the core team meeting to discuss this feature.  Many, many, thanks to Alex Martini for capturing many of these details, but the mess I’ve made of this is not his fault. :-)<br></p><p><br>--- Metapoints --- <br></p><p>First, some meta points that came up from several members of the core team:<br></p><p>- Less is more.  Many folks (core team and other community members both) commented that the mere presence of the expansive “future directions” section made the proposal off-putting.<br></p><p>- “Pure sugar” proposals need to have strong justification for their existence since they do not add new capabilities, but they do add new complexity to the language.<br></p><p>- This feature included justification based on the fact that the existing memberwise feature has problems, but some core team folks thought that this wasn’t good enough justification.  They commented that perhaps we should just remove the existing memberwise init for structs and call it a day.  (others strongly disagreed :-)<br></p><p>- The team wanted to evaluate “all” of the conceivable different approaches to make sure that this approach was the right one in general.  I captured notes about some of that discussion below.  On the balance, they agree that a variant of this proposal is the right way to go.<br></p><p>- We didn’t have time to bikeshed the fine details of the proposal (e.g. the “memberwise” keyword, the … sigil, etc), just discussing the general semantics and shape of what an acceptable solution would look like.<br></p><p><br>MOST SIGNIFICANTLY: there was strong pushback about considering this proposal *at all* right now: this is a pure sugar proposal with a broad design space.  It doesn’t have long term ABI implications at all, and we have other serious semantic problems in the language to clean up and address.  We can tackle this sort of sugar feature at any time, including in Swift 4.  The core team would like to defer talking about this for a couple of months until the other things (property behaviors, resilience, and other big changes) are behind us.  We need to focus on the important things, because getting syntactic niceties into Swift 3 but missing on ABI stability would be really unfortunate.  We have seriously constrained design and engineering bandwidth.  This feedback applies to other pure-sugar proposals as well.<br></p><p><br>--- Rationale --- <br></p><p>I explained three bits of rationale for why we should tackle this:<br></p><p>1) Our existing feature is half-baked and unsatisfying.  This causes me personal angst but, as pointed out above, the simplest solution is to just remove what we have until we can do it right.<br></p><p>2) Memberwise init sugar strongly benefits “POD” types and other “bags of property” types (e.g. “Vec4&quot;), and many of the C struct types that Cocoa has (CGRect etc).  In these cases, clients often want to initialize all of the fields explicitly and a memberwise init proposal eliminates this boilerplate.  This case is what our existing feature attempts to service.<br></p><p>3) Memberwise init sugar can replace some really common “builder” patterns.  These cases often have a bunch of configurable state in a class, where almost all of it has default values, but where clients want to be able to only specify deltas from the default.  In the cases where you have a type with a ton of data members, a memberwise init is very very appealing because it eliminates a ton of boilerplate to set up a builder manually, and it also allows the captured state to be immutable (if we allow memberwise init of lets, which Matthew is a huge proponent of).  This case can often be a class derived from something else (e.g. a Kit class), explaining the desire to specify super.init, add custom parameters, etc.<br></p><p><br>#3 is my distillation/abstraction of many of the arguments that Matthew has made on the list and in the proposal (e.g. his very helpful FontPicker example), but I don’t claim that this captures all of his or any one else’s motivation.  This is simply the rationale that the team discussed.<br></p><p><br>--- Common feedback and points ---<br></p><p>Getting to points common to any “memberwise initializer” proposal, the goals of the core team are:<br></p><p>- Provide a predictable model.  It was concerning to many people that you could accidentally reorder properties and break a memberwise init without knowing/thinking about it.  This directly contravenes the resilience model.  API diff’ing tools and “synthesized header” views in Xcode ameliorate this, but don’t totally solve it.<br></p><p>- After discussion, the desire to support memberwise init of let properties was found to be a strong goal.  The entire win of providing a builder-like pattern in an init method (vs doing initialize to default and reassign over the value later, C# style) is the immutability benefits.<br></p><p>- We would like for memberwise init to be orthogonal to property behaviors, access control, attributes, and all the other stuff you’d want to do on your properties.  Also, ideally, you shouldn’t be limited to what kinds of properties can participate.<br></p><p>- The issues around whether properties with a default value (both let and var) can be replaced by a memberwise init is a really important semantic decision we need to nail down.  Many of the proposals include the problem/fact that something like:<br></p><p>class C {<br>  var x : Int = foo()<br></p><p>  memberwise init(…) {}<br>}<br></p><p>would not run the foo() side effect when initialized with &quot;C(42)”.  Similarly, in a case like:<br></p><p>class C {<br>  let x : Int = 42<br>  memberwise init(…) {}<br>}<br></p><p>it is still very concerning to people that the apparent axiom that “x is 42” could be violated by a memberwise init.  Allowing lets have other implementation issues, such as suddenly making “x” require storage, where it could otherwise be optimized out.<br></p><p><br></p><p>OTOH, my previous objection about being able to write a memberwise init manually is bogus, since you could write the above out like this:<br></p><p>class C {<br>  let x : Int     // initial value removed.<br>  init(x: Int) { self.x = x }   // manually written memberwise init.<br>  init() { x = 42 }  // move the inline initial value here.<br>}<br></p><p><br></p><p>--- Approaches discussed ---<br></p><p>Here are the rough approaches we discussed, along with pros and cons.  For consistency, most of them are modeling the analog of sugarizing an example case like this:<br></p><p>class C : Derived {   // has base class<br>    var x: Int               // no default value.<br>    var y = 4.0            // default value<br>    var z = “foo&quot;          // default value<br></p><p>     // has an explicit “q” parameter as well as all the members as parameters.<br>     init(q: Int, x: Int, y: Double = 4.0, z: String = &quot;foo”) {<br>        self.x = x <br>        self.y = y<br>        self.z = z<br>        // your custom code can go here<br>        super.init(q)<br>    }<br>}<br></p><p>I ordered this so that the most promising ones are at the end, to keep you all in suspense :-)<br></p><p><br>Approach: C# model<br></p><p>As pointed out on the list, we could eliminate the notion of a synthesized memberwise init, and move the complexity to the caller side.  C# uses syntax along the lines of:<br></p><p>	new Foo(){x=42, y=17.0}<br></p><p>pro) No memberwise initializer concept<br>con) Requires all fields to be default initialized, which breaks non-nullable pointers etc.<br>con) Requires mutability, since you’re initializing, and then overwriting a field.<br>con) This specific syntax would be problematic with trailing closures etc.<br></p><p>Core team was strongly opposed to this approach.<br></p><p><br>Approach: Scala (among others) memberwise init as part of class decl<br></p><p>This would give us something like this:<br></p><p>class C(var x: Int, y: Float = 4.0, var z : String = “foo&quot;) : Derived {<br>    var extra = 4.0   // extra, non-memberwise fields supported.<br>    init(q: Int, ...) {  // all initializers get memberwise stuff added, allows bodies.<br>       extra = 17<br>        // your custom code can go here<br>        super.init(q)<br>     }<br>}<br></p><p>pro) Very predictable model, makes it very clear what is subject to memberwise init, and that the order matters<br>pro) This supports indicating that some fields don’t participate in memberwise init.<br>pro?) Syntax looks vaguely like the parameter list of the init<br>con) The syntax isn’t actually parameter list syntax, it is property syntax.  You’d want to accept public/private, let/var, behaviors, attributes, and lots of other stuff in there.  This would introduce confusion about parameter lists.<br>con) This is sticking more junk into the class decl, which is already populated with class attributes/modifiers, subclasses/protocols, etc.<br>con) This means we’ve have two very different ways to declare stored properties in a type.<br></p><p>Core team was strongly opposed to this approach.<br></p><p><br>Approach: Extract the members from the parameters of an initializer decl<br></p><p>This would give us something like this:<br></p><p>class C : Derived {<br>    // members come from the memberwise init.<br>     memberwise init(x: Int, y: Double = 4.0, z: String = &quot;foo”) {<br>        // your custom code can go here<br>        super.init(q)<br>    }<br>}<br></p><p>pro) Syntactically very terse.<br>con) This only supports one memberwise init.<br>con) Two ways to declare stored properties<br>con) Conflates the property grammar (behaviors etc) with parameter grammar, many of the same problems as approach right above does.<br></p><p>Core team was strongly opposed to this approach.<br></p><p><br>Approach: barely extend our existing model:<br></p><p>We could put default values onto our existing memberwise init, and allow you to write &quot;memberwise init(...)” to explicitly request it to be synthesized, but not allow a body.

OTOH, the verbosity isn’t “boilerplate&quot; since we’re getting something out of it. Simple POD cases can be written as (e.g.) “mwi var x, y, z, w : Double” which isn’t bad.<br></p><p>Adding the modifier on the affected property decls helps improve the intentionality and eliminate some of the &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; problem, but the major breakthrough (IMO) is that it allows us to include lets into the model, and gives us a simple answer for why side effects are squashed on vars.  Consider this example:<br></p><p>class C { <br>  mwi let a = 42<br>  mwi var b : Int = sideeffect()<br></p><p>  memberwise init(…) {}<br>}<br></p><p>A call site would look like this, giving A a value of 75 and would not run the side effect:<br> let tmp = C(a: 75, b: 12)<br></p><p>We’re ok with the side effect being squashed, and the let axiom being broken given that there is a decl modifier on the property decl.  This is because you can tell locally by looking at the property that a memberwise initializer provides a different value.  From an implementation perspective, this is also pretty great, because this leads to a very straight-forward codegen model that cleanly meshes with what we already have.<br></p><p><br>--- A path forward --- <br></p><p>So that’s where we left it.  Coming back to the meta point above though, the core team really doesn’t want to discuss this right now, given that this is purely a sugar proposal and we need to stay focused on the primary Swift 3 goals.  If Matthew or another community member wants to pick this up and keep running with it, that is perfectly fine, but we should defer more formal discussion about the proposal until at least march/april-ish.  Likewise, other pure sugar proposals should similarly be deferred at this point, unless they have some strong motivation that aligns with a Swift 3 goal. <br></p><p>I want to thank Matthew in particular for passionately pushing this area forward!<br></p><p>-Chris<br></p><p><br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160112/674000c7/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85a454a69ee2cf2ac4b990dc9e87b664?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0018 Flexible Memberwise Initialization</strong> from <string>Thorsten Seitz</string> &lt;tseitz42 at icloud.com&gt;<p>January 14, 2016 at 08:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>Many thanks to you and the core team for this incredibly detailed rationale and the decision.

The proposal is available here:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0018-flexible-memberwise-initialization.md<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Here are some long and poorly organized notes from the core team meeting to discuss this feature.  Many, many, thanks to Alex Martini for capturing many of these details, but the mess I’ve made of this is not his fault. :-)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; --- Metapoints --- <br>&gt; <br>&gt; First, some meta points that came up from several members of the core team:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - Less is more.  Many folks (core team and other community members both) commented that the mere presence of the expansive “future directions” section made the proposal off-putting.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - “Pure sugar” proposals need to have strong justification for their existence since they do not add new capabilities, but they do add new complexity to the language.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - This feature included justification based on the fact that the existing memberwise feature has problems, but some core team folks thought that this wasn’t good enough justification.  They commented that perhaps we should just remove the existing memberwise init for structs and call it a day.  (others strongly disagreed :-)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - The team wanted to evaluate “all” of the conceivable different approaches to make sure that this approach was the right one in general.  I captured notes about some of that discussion below.  On the balance, they agree that a variant of this proposal is the right way to go.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - We didn’t have time to bikeshed the fine details of the proposal (e.g. the “memberwise” keyword, the … sigil, etc), just discussing the general semantics and shape of what an acceptable solution would look like.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; MOST SIGNIFICANTLY: there was strong pushback about considering this proposal *at all* right now: this is a pure sugar proposal with a broad design space.  It doesn’t have long term ABI implications at all, and we have other serious semantic problems in the language to clean up and address.  We can tackle this sort of sugar feature at any time, including in Swift 4.  The core team would like to defer talking about this for a couple of months until the other things (property behaviors, resilience, and other big changes) are behind us.  We need to focus on the important things, because getting syntactic niceties into Swift 3 but missing on ABI stability would be really unfortunate.  We have seriously constrained design and engineering bandwidth.  This feedback applies to other pure-sugar proposals as well.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; --- Rationale --- <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I explained three bits of rationale for why we should tackle this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1) Our existing feature is half-baked and unsatisfying.  This causes me personal angst but, as pointed out above, the simplest solution is to just remove what we have until we can do it right.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2) Memberwise init sugar strongly benefits “POD” types and other “bags of property” types (e.g. “Vec4&quot;), and many of the C struct types that Cocoa has (CGRect etc).  In these cases, clients often want to initialize all of the fields explicitly and a memberwise init proposal eliminates this boilerplate.  This case is what our existing feature attempts to service.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 3) Memberwise init sugar can replace some really common “builder” patterns.  These cases often have a bunch of configurable state in a class, where almost all of it has default values, but where clients want to be able to only specify deltas from the default.  In the cases where you have a type with a ton of data members, a memberwise init is very very appealing because it eliminates a ton of boilerplate to set up a builder manually, and it also allows the captured state to be immutable (if we allow memberwise init of lets, which Matthew is a huge proponent of).  This case can often be a class derived from something else (e.g. a Kit class), explaining the desire to specify super.init, add custom parameters, etc.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; #3 is my distillation/abstraction of many of the arguments that Matthew has made on the list and in the proposal (e.g. his very helpful FontPicker example), but I don’t claim that this captures all of his or any one else’s motivation.  This is simply the rationale that the team discussed.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; --- Common feedback and points ---<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Getting to points common to any “memberwise initializer” proposal, the goals of the core team are:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - Provide a predictable model.  It was concerning to many people that you could accidentally reorder properties and break a memberwise init without knowing/thinking about it.  This directly contravenes the resilience model.  API diff’ing tools and “synthesized header” views in Xcode ameliorate this, but don’t totally solve it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - After discussion, the desire to support memberwise init of let properties was found to be a strong goal.  The entire win of providing a builder-like pattern in an init method (vs doing initialize to default and reassign over the value later, C# style) is the immutability benefits.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - We would like for memberwise init to be orthogonal to property behaviors, access control, attributes, and all the other stuff you’d want to do on your properties.  Also, ideally, you shouldn’t be limited to what kinds of properties can participate.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - The issues around whether properties with a default value (both let and var) can be replaced by a memberwise init is a really important semantic decision we need to nail down.  Many of the proposals include the problem/fact that something like:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C {<br>&gt;   var x : Int = foo()<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   memberwise init(…) {}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; would not run the foo() side effect when initialized with &quot;C(42)”.  Similarly, in a case like:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C {<br>&gt;   let x : Int = 42<br>&gt;   memberwise init(…) {}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; it is still very concerning to people that the apparent axiom that “x is 42” could be violated by a memberwise init.  Allowing lets have other implementation issues, such as suddenly making “x” require storage, where it could otherwise be optimized out.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; OTOH, my previous objection about being able to write a memberwise init manually is bogus, since you could write the above out like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C {<br>&gt;   let x : Int     // initial value removed.<br>&gt;   init(x: Int) { self.x = x }   // manually written memberwise init.<br>&gt;   init() { x = 42 }  // move the inline initial value here.<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; --- Approaches discussed ---<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Here are the rough approaches we discussed, along with pros and cons.  For consistency, most of them are modeling the analog of sugarizing an example case like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C : Derived {   // has base class<br>&gt;     var x: Int               // no default value.<br>&gt;     var y = 4.0            // default value<br>&gt;     var z = “foo&quot;          // default value<br>&gt; <br>&gt;      // has an explicit “q” parameter as well as all the members as parameters.<br>&gt;      init(q: Int, x: Int, y: Double = 4.0, z: String = &quot;foo”) {<br>&gt;         self.x = x <br>&gt;         self.y = y<br>&gt;         self.z = z<br>&gt;         // your custom code can go here<br>&gt;         super.init(q)<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I ordered this so that the most promising ones are at the end, to keep you all in suspense :-)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Approach: C# model<br>&gt; <br>&gt; As pointed out on the list, we could eliminate the notion of a synthesized memberwise init, and move the complexity to the caller side.  C# uses syntax along the lines of:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	new Foo(){x=42, y=17.0}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; pro) No memberwise initializer concept<br>&gt; con) Requires all fields to be default initialized, which breaks non-nullable pointers etc.<br>&gt; con) Requires mutability, since you’re initializing, and then overwriting a field.<br>&gt; con) This specific syntax would be problematic with trailing closures etc.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Core team was strongly opposed to this approach.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Approach: Scala (among others) memberwise init as part of class decl<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This would give us something like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C(var x: Int, y: Float = 4.0, var z : String = “foo&quot;) : Derived {<br>&gt;     var extra = 4.0   // extra, non-memberwise fields supported.<br>&gt;     init(q: Int, ...) {  // all initializers get memberwise stuff added, allows bodies.<br>&gt;        extra = 17<br>&gt;         // your custom code can go here<br>&gt;         super.init(q)<br>&gt;      }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; pro) Very predictable model, makes it very clear what is subject to memberwise init, and that the order matters<br>&gt; pro) This supports indicating that some fields don’t participate in memberwise init.<br>&gt; pro?) Syntax looks vaguely like the parameter list of the init<br>&gt; con) The syntax isn’t actually parameter list syntax, it is property syntax.  You’d want to accept public/private, let/var, behaviors, attributes, and lots of other stuff in there.  This would introduce confusion about parameter lists.<br>&gt; con) This is sticking more junk into the class decl, which is already populated with class attributes/modifiers, subclasses/protocols, etc.<br>&gt; con) This means we’ve have two very different ways to declare stored properties in a type.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Core team was strongly opposed to this approach.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Approach: Extract the members from the parameters of an initializer decl<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This would give us something like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C : Derived {<br>&gt;     // members come from the memberwise init.<br>&gt;      memberwise init(x: Int, y: Double = 4.0, z: String = &quot;foo”) {<br>&gt;         // your custom code can go here<br>&gt;         super.init(q)<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; pro) Syntactically very terse.<br>&gt; con) This only supports one memberwise init.<br>&gt; con) Two ways to declare stored properties<br>&gt; con) Conflates the property grammar (behaviors etc) with parameter grammar, many of the same problems as approach right above does.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Core team was strongly opposed to this approach.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Approach: barely extend our existing model:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We could put default values onto our existing memberwise init, and allow you to write &quot;memberwise init(...)” to explicitly request it to be synthesized, but not allow a body.  We could bring the existing level of feature to classes.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; pro) simple, solves some problems with the existing model.<br>&gt; pro) brings memberwise init to root classes and classes that derive from something with a init() to chain to (e.g. NSObject).<br>&gt; con) doesn’t solve enough of the problem to be worth it<br>&gt; con) feels like we are perpetuating a hack.<br>&gt; con) we’d have to extend this further at some point, this is just kicking the can down the road.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Core team was strongly opposed to this approach.

The presence of memberwise/… would forward all the properties with default values.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; pro) Since default values can be provided by a callee in any order, this approach can be made stable against reordering of properties.<br>&gt; pro) Compared to the base proposal above, this would be great for the builder pattern case.<br>&gt; con) The POD case still requires you to duplicate all your properties, so this doesn’t really address that use-case.<br>&gt; con) the self.x syntax is weird and surely can be improved, but anything we came up with would be magic and weird.<br>&gt; con) doesn’t address the problems of replacing the var/let initial values (zapping a side effect in either of them, and breaking ‘let’ axioms).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Core team was weakly opposed to this approach.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Approach: Matthew’s proposal SE-0018 (the actual formal proposal :)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C : Derived {<br>&gt;     var x: Int<br>&gt;     var y = 4.0<br>&gt;     var z = “foo&quot;<br>&gt; <br>&gt;      memberwise init(q: Int, ...) {<br>&gt;         // your custom code can go here<br>&gt;         super.init(q)<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; pro) Solves the POD case as well as the builder case.<br>&gt; pro) Keeps properties the way they are, composes with behaviors etc.<br>&gt; pro) Supports adding custom parameters to the initializer, supports custom chaining to super.init, etc.<br>&gt; pro) Supports multiple different memberwise inits in a class, e.g. that want to chain to different super.init’s.<br>&gt; pro) Like the clarity of having a keyword on the init, and a sigil in the parameter list saying that something is going on.<br>&gt; unclear) I’m not delving into it here, but the access control aspects were very controversial.  We didn’t discuss it fully.<br>&gt; con) compared to the Scala approach, doesn’t handle the ability to opt a member out of memberwise init (we’d need some thing like @nomemberwise) <br>&gt; con) Doesn’t address the problems of replacing the var/let initial values (zapping a side effect in either of them, and breaking ‘let’ axioms).<br>&gt; con) Lots of concerns about unclarity that the order of the properties matter.  In a large type, the memberwise init could be “at the end” of the class, after a bunch of other initializers and methods, and the properties could be “up at the top”.  It could be very unclear to people that memberwise init is even happening, and changing a property could have surprising effects.<br>&gt; con) Not clear from the memberwise init declaration what the extra parameters are, you have to look at a synthesized header or something.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Core team thought this was very close, but the problems were significant enough to think it won’t fly, and suggest pursuing the variant below.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Approach: &quot;Opt-in&quot; version of Matthew’s proposal<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Matthew has mentioned on list that he likes opt-in models, and after discussion the core team agreed that it is more promising than the base proposal.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In addition to the memberwise declmodifier, *also* introduce a declmodifier on the properties in question.  Here I’ll use “mwi” as a strawman for “memberwise initializerable”, but it is obviously not the right thing, and I’m sure it will be replaced with something else brilliant :-)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C : Derived {<br>&gt;     mwi var x: Int<br>&gt;     mwi var y = 4.0<br>&gt;     mwi var z = “foo&quot;<br>&gt;     var extra = 4.0   // Doesn’t participate in memberwise inits.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;      memberwise init(q: Int, ...) {<br>&gt;         // your custom code can go here<br>&gt;         super.init(q)<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; pro) Solves the POD case as well as the builder case.<br>&gt; pro) Keeps properties the way they are, composes with behaviors etc.<br>&gt; pro) Supports adding custom parameters to the initializer, supports custom chaining to super.init, etc.<br>&gt; pro) Supports multiple different memberwise inits in a class, e.g. that want to chain to different super.init’s.<br>&gt; pro) Like the clarity of having a keyword on the init, and a sigil in the parameter list saying that something is going on.<br>&gt; pro) as with the Scala approach it handles the ability to have members be both memberwise and non-memberwise participating.<br>&gt; pro) Works with let and var initializer semantics.<br>&gt; pro) Looking at a property, you know immediately that it participates in memberwise init, and that you should go update the memberwise inits if you move it or change it.  We could warn/error if you have a “mwi” property and no memberwise init, or a memberwise init with no mwi property.<br>&gt; pro) because this is an opt-in model, we can eliminate the controversial access control aspect of SE-0018.<br>&gt; con) Not clear from the memberwise init declaration what the extra parameters are, you have to look at a synthesized header or something.<br>&gt; con) more verbose than Matthew’s proposal.  OTOH, the verbosity isn’t “boilerplate&quot; since we’re getting something out of it. Simple POD cases can be written as (e.g.) “mwi var x, y, z, w : Double” which isn’t bad.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Adding the modifier on the affected property decls helps improve the intentionality and eliminate some of the &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; problem, but the major breakthrough (IMO) is that it allows us to include lets into the model, and gives us a simple answer for why side effects are squashed on vars.  Consider this example:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C { <br>&gt;   mwi let a = 42<br>&gt;   mwi var b : Int = sideeffect()<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   memberwise init(…) {}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; A call site would look like this, giving A a value of 75 and would not run the side effect:<br>&gt;  let tmp = C(a: 75, b: 12)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We’re ok with the side effect being squashed, and the let axiom being broken given that there is a decl modifier on the property decl.  This is because you can tell locally by looking at the property that a memberwise initializer provides a different value.  From an implementation perspective, this is also pretty great, because this leads to a very straight-forward codegen model that cleanly meshes with what we already have.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; --- A path forward --- <br>&gt; <br>&gt; So that’s where we left it.  Coming back to the meta point above though, the core team really doesn’t want to discuss this right now, given that this is purely a sugar proposal and we need to stay focused on the primary Swift 3 goals.  If Matthew or another community member wants to pick this up and keep running with it, that is perfectly fine, but we should defer more formal discussion about the proposal until at least march/april-ish.  Likewise, other pure sugar proposals should similarly be deferred at this point, unless they have some strong motivation that aligns with a Swift 3 goal. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I want to thank Matthew in particular for passionately pushing this area forward!<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Chris<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160114/28224665/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc3a9ea0c6c870343d9acb4ac3059cdc?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0018 Flexible Memberwise Initialization</strong> from <string>Matthew Johnson</string> &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt;<p>January 14, 2016 at 08:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>I want to thank the core team for putting so much thought and consideration into their feedback.

The proposal is available here:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0018-flexible-memberwise-initialization.md &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0018-flexible-memberwise-initialization.md&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Here are some long and poorly organized notes from the core team meeting to discuss this feature.  Many, many, thanks to Alex Martini for capturing many of these details, but the mess I’ve made of this is not his fault. :-)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; --- Metapoints --- <br>&gt; <br>&gt; First, some meta points that came up from several members of the core team:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - Less is more.  Many folks (core team and other community members both) commented that the mere presence of the expansive “future directions” section made the proposal off-putting.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - “Pure sugar” proposals need to have strong justification for their existence since they do not add new capabilities, but they do add new complexity to the language.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - This feature included justification based on the fact that the existing memberwise feature has problems, but some core team folks thought that this wasn’t good enough justification.  They commented that perhaps we should just remove the existing memberwise init for structs and call it a day.  (others strongly disagreed :-)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - The team wanted to evaluate “all” of the conceivable different approaches to make sure that this approach was the right one in general.  I captured notes about some of that discussion below.  On the balance, they agree that a variant of this proposal is the right way to go.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - We didn’t have time to bikeshed the fine details of the proposal (e.g. the “memberwise” keyword, the … sigil, etc), just discussing the general semantics and shape of what an acceptable solution would look like.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; MOST SIGNIFICANTLY: there was strong pushback about considering this proposal *at all* right now: this is a pure sugar proposal with a broad design space.  It doesn’t have long term ABI implications at all, and we have other serious semantic problems in the language to clean up and address.  We can tackle this sort of sugar feature at any time, including in Swift 4.  The core team would like to defer talking about this for a couple of months until the other things (property behaviors, resilience, and other big changes) are behind us.  We need to focus on the important things, because getting syntactic niceties into Swift 3 but missing on ABI stability would be really unfortunate.  We have seriously constrained design and engineering bandwidth.  This feedback applies to other pure-sugar proposals as well.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; --- Rationale --- <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I explained three bits of rationale for why we should tackle this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1) Our existing feature is half-baked and unsatisfying.  This causes me personal angst but, as pointed out above, the simplest solution is to just remove what we have until we can do it right.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2) Memberwise init sugar strongly benefits “POD” types and other “bags of property” types (e.g. “Vec4&quot;), and many of the C struct types that Cocoa has (CGRect etc).  In these cases, clients often want to initialize all of the fields explicitly and a memberwise init proposal eliminates this boilerplate.  This case is what our existing feature attempts to service.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 3) Memberwise init sugar can replace some really common “builder” patterns.  These cases often have a bunch of configurable state in a class, where almost all of it has default values, but where clients want to be able to only specify deltas from the default.  In the cases where you have a type with a ton of data members, a memberwise init is very very appealing because it eliminates a ton of boilerplate to set up a builder manually, and it also allows the captured state to be immutable (if we allow memberwise init of lets, which Matthew is a huge proponent of).  This case can often be a class derived from something else (e.g. a Kit class), explaining the desire to specify super.init, add custom parameters, etc.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; #3 is my distillation/abstraction of many of the arguments that Matthew has made on the list and in the proposal (e.g. his very helpful FontPicker example), but I don’t claim that this captures all of his or any one else’s motivation.  This is simply the rationale that the team discussed.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; --- Common feedback and points ---<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Getting to points common to any “memberwise initializer” proposal, the goals of the core team are:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - Provide a predictable model.  It was concerning to many people that you could accidentally reorder properties and break a memberwise init without knowing/thinking about it.  This directly contravenes the resilience model.  API diff’ing tools and “synthesized header” views in Xcode ameliorate this, but don’t totally solve it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - After discussion, the desire to support memberwise init of let properties was found to be a strong goal.  The entire win of providing a builder-like pattern in an init method (vs doing initialize to default and reassign over the value later, C# style) is the immutability benefits.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - We would like for memberwise init to be orthogonal to property behaviors, access control, attributes, and all the other stuff you’d want to do on your properties.  Also, ideally, you shouldn’t be limited to what kinds of properties can participate.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - The issues around whether properties with a default value (both let and var) can be replaced by a memberwise init is a really important semantic decision we need to nail down.  Many of the proposals include the problem/fact that something like:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C {<br>&gt;   var x : Int = foo()<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   memberwise init(…) {}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; would not run the foo() side effect when initialized with &quot;C(42)”.  Similarly, in a case like:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C {<br>&gt;   let x : Int = 42<br>&gt;   memberwise init(…) {}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; it is still very concerning to people that the apparent axiom that “x is 42” could be violated by a memberwise init.  Allowing lets have other implementation issues, such as suddenly making “x” require storage, where it could otherwise be optimized out.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; OTOH, my previous objection about being able to write a memberwise init manually is bogus, since you could write the above out like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C {<br>&gt;   let x : Int     // initial value removed.<br>&gt;   init(x: Int) { self.x = x }   // manually written memberwise init.<br>&gt;   init() { x = 42 }  // move the inline initial value here.<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; --- Approaches discussed ---<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Here are the rough approaches we discussed, along with pros and cons.  For consistency, most of them are modeling the analog of sugarizing an example case like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C : Derived {   // has base class<br>&gt;     var x: Int               // no default value.<br>&gt;     var y = 4.0            // default value<br>&gt;     var z = “foo&quot;          // default value<br>&gt; <br>&gt;      // has an explicit “q” parameter as well as all the members as parameters.<br>&gt;      init(q: Int, x: Int, y: Double = 4.0, z: String = &quot;foo”) {<br>&gt;         self.x = x <br>&gt;         self.y = y<br>&gt;         self.z = z<br>&gt;         // your custom code can go here<br>&gt;         super.init(q)<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I ordered this so that the most promising ones are at the end, to keep you all in suspense :-)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Approach: C# model<br>&gt; <br>&gt; As pointed out on the list, we could eliminate the notion of a synthesized memberwise init, and move the complexity to the caller side.  C# uses syntax along the lines of:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	new Foo(){x=42, y=17.0}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; pro) No memberwise initializer concept<br>&gt; con) Requires all fields to be default initialized, which breaks non-nullable pointers etc.<br>&gt; con) Requires mutability, since you’re initializing, and then overwriting a field.<br>&gt; con) This specific syntax would be problematic with trailing closures etc.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Core team was strongly opposed to this approach.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Approach: Scala (among others) memberwise init as part of class decl<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This would give us something like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C(var x: Int, y: Float = 4.0, var z : String = “foo&quot;) : Derived {<br>&gt;     var extra = 4.0   // extra, non-memberwise fields supported.<br>&gt;     init(q: Int, ...) {  // all initializers get memberwise stuff added, allows bodies.<br>&gt;        extra = 17<br>&gt;         // your custom code can go here<br>&gt;         super.init(q)<br>&gt;      }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; pro) Very predictable model, makes it very clear what is subject to memberwise init, and that the order matters<br>&gt; pro) This supports indicating that some fields don’t participate in memberwise init.<br>&gt; pro?) Syntax looks vaguely like the parameter list of the init<br>&gt; con) The syntax isn’t actually parameter list syntax, it is property syntax.  You’d want to accept public/private, let/var, behaviors, attributes, and lots of other stuff in there.  This would introduce confusion about parameter lists.<br>&gt; con) This is sticking more junk into the class decl, which is already populated with class attributes/modifiers, subclasses/protocols, etc.<br>&gt; con) This means we’ve have two very different ways to declare stored properties in a type.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Core team was strongly opposed to this approach.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Approach: Extract the members from the parameters of an initializer decl<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This would give us something like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C : Derived {<br>&gt;     // members come from the memberwise init.<br>&gt;      memberwise init(x: Int, y: Double = 4.0, z: String = &quot;foo”) {<br>&gt;         // your custom code can go here<br>&gt;         super.init(q)<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; pro) Syntactically very terse.<br>&gt; con) This only supports one memberwise init.<br>&gt; con) Two ways to declare stored properties<br>&gt; con) Conflates the property grammar (behaviors etc) with parameter grammar, many of the same problems as approach right above does.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Core team was strongly opposed to this approach.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Approach: barely extend our existing model:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We could put default values onto our existing memberwise init, and allow you to write &quot;memberwise init(...)” to explicitly request it to be synthesized, but not allow a body.  We could bring the existing level of feature to classes.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; pro) simple, solves some problems with the existing model.<br>&gt; pro) brings memberwise init to root classes and classes that derive from something with a init() to chain to (e.g. NSObject).<br>&gt; con) doesn’t solve enough of the problem to be worth it<br>&gt; con) feels like we are perpetuating a hack.<br>&gt; con) we’d have to extend this further at some point, this is just kicking the can down the road.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Core team was strongly opposed to this approach.  Better to either rip out what we have or do a bigger approach.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Approach: Magic “members” tuple (or other generics/variadics features) <br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C : Derived {<br>&gt;     var x: Int<br>&gt;     var y = 4.0<br>&gt;     var z = “foo&quot;<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     init(p : … Members) {<br>&gt;        self.members = p<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     // compiler synthesizes.<br>&gt;     typealias Members = (Int, Float, String)<br>&gt;     var members : Members { get {..} set {..}}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; pro) seems like a more generally useful feature that could pay for itself in other ways<br>&gt; con) doesn’t work with default values, so it doesn’t solve the builder problem at all (and no, we are not adding default values back to tuple types :-)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Core team was strongly opposed to this as an approach for memberwise init, but can always consider doing this for other things if it is motivated by them.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Approach: Introduce sugar for “self.x = x&quot;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; David Owens ][ mentioned that perhaps we can go with something simpler, like this (concrete syntax is just a strawman):<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C : Derived {<br>&gt;     var x: Int<br>&gt;     var y = 4.0<br>&gt;     var z = “foo&quot;<br>&gt; <br>&gt;      init(q: Int, self.x, self.y, self.z) { <br>&gt;         // your custom code can go here<br>&gt;         super.init(q)<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; … where self.x in the parameter list is sugar that says it takes whatever the x property is (incl type and initial value if present), and does &quot;self.x = x” in the body.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; pro) Does not require introducing the notion of a memberwise init.  Any init could use this.<br>&gt; pro) Makes it very clear what members are being initialized and what the API for the init is.<br>&gt; pro) Makes it easy to pick and choose which members you want to make available to clients.<br>&gt; con) This isn’t sweet enough sugar to be worthwhile, particularly for the builder pattern case, which would require lots of boilerplate<br>&gt; con) the self.x syntax is weird and surely can be improved, but anything we came up with would be magic and weird.  Making this keyword driven (e.g. &quot;memberwise” at least gives people something to google and lets them know they’re looking at something magic).<br>&gt; con) doesn’t address the problems of replacing the var/let initial values (zapping a side effect in either of them, and breaking ‘let’ axioms).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Core team was weakly opposed to this approach, but agree that something like this could be composed on top of another proposal if that made sense.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Approach: Introduce sugar for “self.x = x”, and add “memberwise and …&quot;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Extending David Owens ][’s model a bit, we could keep the behavior he indicates and add memberwise/… to handle cases with default values:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C : Derived {<br>&gt;     var x: Int<br>&gt;     var y = 4.0<br>&gt;     var z = “foo&quot;<br>&gt; <br>&gt;      memberwise init(q: Int, self.x, ...) { <br>&gt;         // your custom code can go here<br>&gt;         super.init(q)<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; … where self.x in the parameter list is sugar that says it takes whatever the x property is (incl type and initial value if present), and does &quot;self.x = x” in the body.  The presence of memberwise/… would forward all the properties with default values.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; pro) Since default values can be provided by a callee in any order, this approach can be made stable against reordering of properties.<br>&gt; pro) Compared to the base proposal above, this would be great for the builder pattern case.<br>&gt; con) The POD case still requires you to duplicate all your properties, so this doesn’t really address that use-case.<br>&gt; con) the self.x syntax is weird and surely can be improved, but anything we came up with would be magic and weird.<br>&gt; con) doesn’t address the problems of replacing the var/let initial values (zapping a side effect in either of them, and breaking ‘let’ axioms).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Core team was weakly opposed to this approach.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Approach: Matthew’s proposal SE-0018 (the actual formal proposal :)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C : Derived {<br>&gt;     var x: Int<br>&gt;     var y = 4.0<br>&gt;     var z = “foo&quot;<br>&gt; <br>&gt;      memberwise init(q: Int, ...) {<br>&gt;         // your custom code can go here<br>&gt;         super.init(q)<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; pro) Solves the POD case as well as the builder case.<br>&gt; pro) Keeps properties the way they are, composes with behaviors etc.<br>&gt; pro) Supports adding custom parameters to the initializer, supports custom chaining to super.init, etc.<br>&gt; pro) Supports multiple different memberwise inits in a class, e.g. that want to chain to different super.init’s.<br>&gt; pro) Like the clarity of having a keyword on the init, and a sigil in the parameter list saying that something is going on.<br>&gt; unclear) I’m not delving into it here, but the access control aspects were very controversial.  We didn’t discuss it fully.<br>&gt; con) compared to the Scala approach, doesn’t handle the ability to opt a member out of memberwise init (we’d need some thing like @nomemberwise) <br>&gt; con) Doesn’t address the problems of replacing the var/let initial values (zapping a side effect in either of them, and breaking ‘let’ axioms).<br>&gt; con) Lots of concerns about unclarity that the order of the properties matter.  In a large type, the memberwise init could be “at the end” of the class, after a bunch of other initializers and methods, and the properties could be “up at the top”.  It could be very unclear to people that memberwise init is even happening, and changing a property could have surprising effects.<br>&gt; con) Not clear from the memberwise init declaration what the extra parameters are, you have to look at a synthesized header or something.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Core team thought this was very close, but the problems were significant enough to think it won’t fly, and suggest pursuing the variant below.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Approach: &quot;Opt-in&quot; version of Matthew’s proposal<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Matthew has mentioned on list that he likes opt-in models, and after discussion the core team agreed that it is more promising than the base proposal.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In addition to the memberwise declmodifier, *also* introduce a declmodifier on the properties in question.  Here I’ll use “mwi” as a strawman for “memberwise initializerable”, but it is obviously not the right thing, and I’m sure it will be replaced with something else brilliant :-)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C : Derived {<br>&gt;     mwi var x: Int<br>&gt;     mwi var y = 4.0<br>&gt;     mwi var z = “foo&quot;<br>&gt;     var extra = 4.0   // Doesn’t participate in memberwise inits.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;      memberwise init(q: Int, ...) {<br>&gt;         // your custom code can go here<br>&gt;         super.init(q)<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; pro) Solves the POD case as well as the builder case.<br>&gt; pro) Keeps properties the way they are, composes with behaviors etc.<br>&gt; pro) Supports adding custom parameters to the initializer, supports custom chaining to super.init, etc.<br>&gt; pro) Supports multiple different memberwise inits in a class, e.g. that want to chain to different super.init’s.<br>&gt; pro) Like the clarity of having a keyword on the init, and a sigil in the parameter list saying that something is going on.<br>&gt; pro) as with the Scala approach it handles the ability to have members be both memberwise and non-memberwise participating.<br>&gt; pro) Works with let and var initializer semantics.<br>&gt; pro) Looking at a property, you know immediately that it participates in memberwise init, and that you should go update the memberwise inits if you move it or change it.  We could warn/error if you have a “mwi” property and no memberwise init, or a memberwise init with no mwi property.<br>&gt; pro) because this is an opt-in model, we can eliminate the controversial access control aspect of SE-0018.<br>&gt; con) Not clear from the memberwise init declaration what the extra parameters are, you have to look at a synthesized header or something.<br>&gt; con) more verbose than Matthew’s proposal.  OTOH, the verbosity isn’t “boilerplate&quot; since we’re getting something out of it. Simple POD cases can be written as (e.g.) “mwi var x, y, z, w : Double” which isn’t bad.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Adding the modifier on the affected property decls helps improve the intentionality and eliminate some of the &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; problem, but the major breakthrough (IMO) is that it allows us to include lets into the model, and gives us a simple answer for why side effects are squashed on vars.  Consider this example:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C { <br>&gt;   mwi let a = 42<br>&gt;   mwi var b : Int = sideeffect()<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   memberwise init(…) {}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; A call site would look like this, giving A a value of 75 and would not run the side effect:<br>&gt;  let tmp = C(a: 75, b: 12)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We’re ok with the side effect being squashed, and the let axiom being broken given that there is a decl modifier on the property decl.  This is because you can tell locally by looking at the property that a memberwise initializer provides a different value.  From an implementation perspective, this is also pretty great, because this leads to a very straight-forward codegen model that cleanly meshes with what we already have.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; --- A path forward --- <br>&gt; <br>&gt; So that’s where we left it.  Coming back to the meta point above though, the core team really doesn’t want to discuss this right now, given that this is purely a sugar proposal and we need to stay focused on the primary Swift 3 goals.  If Matthew or another community member wants to pick this up and keep running with it, that is perfectly fine, but we should defer more formal discussion about the proposal until at least march/april-ish.  Likewise, other pure sugar proposals should similarly be deferred at this point, unless they have some strong motivation that aligns with a Swift 3 goal. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I want to thank Matthew in particular for passionately pushing this area forward!<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Chris<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160114/2943fdd7/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0018 Flexible Memberwise Initialization</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>January 17, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jan 14, 2016, at 6:35 AM, Matthew Johnson &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I want to thank the core team for putting so much thought and consideration into their feedback.

I began to be concerned about the &quot;complexity&quot; of the “automatic&quot; model prior to the start of the review and those concerns proved to be shared by many.  Using an &quot;opt-in&quot; approach will provide much-needed clarity.  I am especially happy to see that the core team has decided that supporting default parameter values for `let` properties is an important aspect of an eventual solution.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; There is one thing that isn&#39;t clear to me in the feedback.  Does the core team believe the implicit memberwise initializer should: <br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1) Remain in its current form<br>&gt; 2) Remain in a slightly enhanced form (i.e. receive default parameter values)<br>&gt; 3) Remain in an enhanced form and also be extended to classes<br>&gt; 4) Be removed in favor of making all initilaizers explicitly declared<br></p><p>The core team as a whole didn’t discuss this, but the design that I think makes sense is:<br></p><p>- Extend the current support to root classes and derived classes whose base has a zero-argument init to chain to (e.g. NSObject).<br>- *Consider* extending the current support to have default values on the parameters.  This will be contentious with the core team given the discussion about killing side effects and changing let axioms, etc.<br></p><p>That said, when it comes time to discuss this, I’d suggest just looking at both options and enumerating tradeoffs.<br></p><p>&gt; As requested, I will defer work on a modified formal proposal until the time is right.

At John McCall&#39;s request I am including an a section that describes how partial initializers could be related to memberwise intialization.  I hope to have the draft ready later today.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thank you again to everyone who participated in the discussion and review of my proposal.  It has been a very productive conversation.   My thinking about the topic has been refined and clarified significantly by this process.<br></p><p>Thank you again for driving this Matthew, I still really want to see this area improved and cleaned up.<br></p><p>-Chris<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
