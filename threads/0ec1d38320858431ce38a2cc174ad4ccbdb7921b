To me there is no difference between<br>&gt; `union` and `formUnion`: both sounds functional-style, and actually<br>&gt; the second one perhaps a bit more to my ears. There&#39;s basically two<br>&gt; dictionary definitions of &quot;form&quot;:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 1. &quot;bring together parts or combine to create (something)&quot; which to me<br>&gt; implies a new value is created, and<br>&gt; 2. &quot;make or fashion into a certain shape or form&quot; which would imply<br>&gt; that the material you start with is transformed, which is apparently<br>&gt; the intended meaning and also the reverse meaning from the above.<br></p><p>When you tell a group of people to “form a circle,” you&#39;re asking them<br>to assume the shape of a circle, not to create a new identity.  That&#39;s<br>the way I view “formUnion.”<br></p><p>&gt; I mean, doesn&#39;t this make sense as an API?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 	let donut = baker.formDonut(dough) // non-mutating<br></p><p>Not if you account for the rule that verb phrases and side-effects are<br>always linked.<br></p><p>&gt; Perhaps instead of &quot;form&quot; we could use &quot;become&quot; as a prefix when the<br>&gt; operation is naturally described by a noun. That would seem less<br>&gt; ambiguous to me:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 	a.becomeUnion(b)<br>&gt; 	a.becomeIntersection(b)<br>&gt; 	a.becomeSuccessor(b)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It&#39;s a bit passive, but I find it fits well when the operation is a<br>&gt; noun.<br></p><p>The latter one doesn&#39;t work at all for the actual use case.  It sounds<br>like you&#39;re telling a to become the successor of b.  In fact, it&#39;s <br></p><p>     someCollection.formSuccessor(&amp;someIndex)<br></p><p>which is updating someIndex to point at its successor position.<br></p><p>&gt; And there&#39;s no way the term lends itself to non-mutating cases without<br>&gt; things becoming nonsensical:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 	let donut = baker.becomeDonut(dough) // non-mutating?<br></p><p>I agree that is more unambiguous.<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I&#39;m still not entirely convinced any of this is better than the<br>&gt; `InPlace` suffix we had before. `InPlace` might be ugly visually and<br>&gt; grammatically, but seems to be the clearest at expressing the intent.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; There is no question that using a verb instead of the `InPlace` suffix<br>&gt; makes things fits better with the other API guidelines.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar<br>&gt;&gt; feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; N/A<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Read the guideline and API diffs, thought about a few alternative wording, looked in my dictionary.<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
