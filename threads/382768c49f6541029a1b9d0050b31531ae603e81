Files are named using a pattern which indicate which targets they should be included in? e.g. Sources/_Shared/iOS_Foo.swift, Sources/_Shared/iOS_watchOS_Foo.swift - Pro: can tell from looking at the file name what platform it would be included in.

Some kind of source code annotation. i.e. annotate the source files in a comment block in such as way that their platform/target membership match up to what is defined in Package.swift - Pro: probably the most flexible, Changing targets/configuration can be tracked in SCM. - Con: still hard to visualize (but could be solved with tooling), introduces configuration which isn’t in Package.swift? <br></p><p>4.

But this is how I expect it will work in your Package.swift:<br></p><p>#if os(Linux)<br>targets[&quot;foo&quot;].sources.remove(&quot;foo/bar.swift&quot;)<br>#endif<br></p><p>I have talked at length with other people here about potentially having directories for each platform, and ultimately we decided this leads to source layouts that are difficult to read and maintain. We feel that you are better served by writing modules that are cross-platform and then having apps that have a target per platform with some sources added and removed.<br></p><p>However, because our manifest is Swift you can easily cater to layouts that use a pattern of your choosing:<br></p><p>#if os(Linux)<br>targets[&quot;foo&quot;].sources = targets[&quot;foo&quot;].sources.filter {<br>   return $0.hasSuffix(&quot;.linux.swift&quot;)<br>}<br>#endif<br></p><p>I don’t think we should encourage excessive nesting of modules for platforms. It is just not practical. We aim for a sensible, pragmatic solution that caters to majority usage but is flexible enough to provide the features people need.<br></p><p>&gt; On Dec 7, 2015, at 1:09 PM, Dan Thorpe via swift-build-dev &lt;swift-build-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hi<br>&gt; <br>&gt; First of all - congratulations to the Swift team for all their work, it’s really exciting times, and Swift Package Manager especially is a welcome surprise.
