An engineer at Apple noticed the following behavior:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. class Foo: NSObject → exposed to Objective-C, Swift-style (mangled) runtime name<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. @objc class Foo: NSObject → exposed to Objective-C, Swift-style (mangled) runtime name<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. @objc(Foo) class Foo: NSObject → exposed to Objective-C, unmangled runtime name<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (and 4. @objc class Foo → illegal, classes must have ObjC heritage to be @objc.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; They specifically observed that (1) and (2) have the same behavior, and suggested that maybe (2) should be shorthand for (3).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Pros:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - There aren&#39;t two ways to spell (1).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - Removing the mangling (and module uniquing) from the runtime name is probably one of the most common uses of @objc on a class.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Cons:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - It&#39;s a source-breaking change, for all that the &quot;@objc&quot; in (2) is redundant.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - For protocols, (1) and (2) are not equivalent, because @objc isn&#39;t inherited there.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - Mangling is used to namespace class names at run time; if you drop that, the ObjC name should probably have a prefix. (This applies more to frameworks than apps, though.)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I’m -1 on this, because bare “@objc” in other contexts means “make sure this is exposed to Objective-C, but I don’t want to be explicit about the name” while “@objc(something)” means “make sure this is exposed to Objective-C, and ‘something’ is the name”. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; -1 <br>&gt; Please&#39;o&#39;please ... I find it useful for complexifying simple swift names into the kind that typically exists on the objc side.<br></p><p>To be clear, the argument form wouldn’t change, but it seems like there’s enough negative feedback on this that we shouldn’t do it.
