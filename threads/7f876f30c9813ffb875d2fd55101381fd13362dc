The proposal itself mentions that this may be a<br>temporary solution, and while I believe temporary solutions tend to add<br>more complexity over the long-term, and tend to end up being<br>not-so-temporary, I think interfacing well with Objective-C in a type safe<br>manner is important.<br></p><p>&gt; Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes, I would consider this to be a natural extension of SE-0022. In fact, I<br>think SE-0022 isn&#39;t really complete without this.<br></p><p>&gt; If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how<br>do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>There are two ways to think of this feature: As a worse alternative to<br>lenses, and as a more type-safe mechanism for interoperating with<br>Objective-C.<br></p><p>The proposal already covers the first, acknowledging that lenses are<br>out-of-scope for Swift 3.<br></p><p>As for the second, I have used other languages with Objective-C bridges,<br>and all of them dealt with this problem by simply using foo for the getter,<br>and setFoo: for the setter. This approach has the advantage over SE-0064 of<br>not requiring any additional overloads, and I&#39;m not quite sure why SE-0022<br>wasn&#39;t just implemented this way to begin with. Because it keeps the<br>language simpler, I probably would have advocated for this approach, but I<br>don&#39;t think the impact is particularly large, and since SE-0064 is already<br>at the proposal stage, it&#39;s probably just water under the bridge at this<br>point.<br></p><p>&gt; How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading,<br>or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>I read through the proposal and the previous two threads, and thought about<br>it for a few minutes.<br></p><p>On Thu, Apr 7, 2016 at 1:57 PM, Douglas Gregor &lt;dgregor at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The review of SE-0064 &quot;Referencing the Objective-C selector of property<br>&gt; getters and setters&quot; begins now and runs through April 12, 2016.

I agree with Michael Buckley that this feels more like an oversight in SE-0022 rather than a completely new thing.<br></p><p>&gt; Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>Yes. I think it makes sense to use explicit getter/setter parameter names, as opposed to relying on the ObjC-based foo/setFoo: conventions. While the lines between property accessors and methods are blurry in ObjC, they are different things in Swift. I’m aware that this feature requires ObjC under the hood, but that’s not something you need to know when creating a selector.<br></p><p>&gt; If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>Well, ObjC… I’ve explained the difference above.<br></p><p>&gt; How much effort did you put into your review?
