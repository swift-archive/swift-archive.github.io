The proposal is available here:<br></p><p>	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0050-floating-point-stride.md<br></p><p>Reviews are an important part of the Swift evolution process. All reviews should be sent to the swift-evolution mailing list at<br></p><p>	https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>or, if you would like to keep your feedback private, directly to the review manager.<br></p><p>What goes into a review?<br></p><p>The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review through constructive criticism and contribute to the direction of Swift. When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br></p><p>	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br></p><p>	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br></p><p>Thank you,<br></p><p>-Chris Lattner<br>Review Manager<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0050: Decoupling Floating Point Strides from Generic Implementations</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>May 18, 2016 at 11:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>No mistake: this is a pretty ugly solution to the problem. However, it *is* a problem that badly needs solving, and all the other solutions (like &quot;always use the float logic and let the optimizer fix it up into integer logic&quot;) are far worse. So I believe this proposal should be accepted.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. Striding simply doesn&#39;t work properly on floating-point types right now. That needs to be fixed.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>Most languages I&#39;ve used just let you write shitty floating-point code. It&#39;s nice to see Swift helping you write good floating-point code.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>Quick reading and some private experiments.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
