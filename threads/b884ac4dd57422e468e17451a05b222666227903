Tuples are &#39;type safe&#39; for any definition of &#39;type safety&#39;<br>that I can summon. Switching over tuples to restructure them is, in my<br>opinion, a main source of the type safety provided in tuples. I do hope<br>that, along with conditional conformance and the ability to add extensions<br>with self same types, we get the ability to define extensions on tuples.<br>These features would allow us more convenience when dealing with tuples and<br>might possibly ease the woes that you are presenting.<br></p><p>TJ<br></p><p>On Fri, Sep 16, 2016 at 4:05 PM, Muhammad Tahir Vali via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Type safety would make tuples far more powerful than their current<br>&gt; limitations.
