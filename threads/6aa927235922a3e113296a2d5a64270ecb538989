Hopefully these patterns can be optimized across modules eventually. <br></p><p>Agreed. I think we&#39;ll eventually want some way to &quot;inline&quot; dependencies with the package manager to treat them as one target for optimization purposes. The standard library is fancier even and can essentially specializes and inlines most of it&#39;s code into yours when you use it but I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll get those abilities for our own modules at some point.<br></p><p>For now you can use @transparent (or @_transparent for Swift 2.2) to force-inline functions across module boundaries but that&#39;s it as far as I know.<br></p><p>&gt; It&#39;s easy enough to write a pre-processor that expands the generics into four specializations. But it doesn&#39;t solve everything so not a priority.<br>&gt;  <br>&gt; And since you probably need to drop generics anyway it might make sense to simply wrap the respective GLKit types on OS X and iOS for the GLFloat variants as they are already highly optimized. I have some wrappers for the GLKMatrix and GLKVector types lying around in my own OpenGL wrapper (incidentally also named SwiftGL ;-)) which might save you some typing if you&#39;re interested...<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m trailblazing cross-platform OpenGL in Swift. Given there&#39;s only one other platform, the key question is, &quot;Does it work on Linux?&quot;<br></p><p>If you only care about having a simple cross-platform library, doing a simple implementation by yourself is fine. Also Swift (well, LLVM) is also pretty good at auto-vectorization so you get decent results for custom vector/matrix types.<br></p><p>However OpenGL-related code is usually pretty performance sensitive and the math parts doubly so, so I&#39;d recommend wrapping some appropriate libraries instead of writing your own...<br></p><p>Now if you find a nice cross-platform C library you could wrap that, C++ (for example http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.7/api/index.html &lt;http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.7/api/index.html&gt;) also works but then you&#39;d also have to write a C wrapper first :-(<br></p><p>Now on the Apple side, the Accelerate, GLKit and simd modules contain vector and matrix types/functions but these are OS X and iOS only...<br>Using a single cross platform library is obviously simpler but using these on the Apple platforms would remove the need for a separate dependency there and they are likely well optimized for the target architectures.<br></p><p>&gt; Is your SwiftGL online somewhere? A cursory search didn&#39;t yield anything. <br></p><p>No. I mostly just wrapped the OpenGL symbols I needed and experimented with some other additions but as a whole it wasn&#39;t really in a state to be published. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;d be much use to you but if you&#39;re interested l I can give you the code in whatever form is most convenient for you :-)<br></p><p>&gt; -david (https://github.com/AE9RB/SwiftGL &lt;https://github.com/AE9RB/SwiftGL&gt;)<br></p><p>- Janosch<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20151219/6aa98989/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
