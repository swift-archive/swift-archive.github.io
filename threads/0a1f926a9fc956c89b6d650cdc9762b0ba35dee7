Statement scope would avoid problems like this.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are thinking about this the inverse way. That the first case works is an artifact of the optimizer failing to do a good enough job. Future improved ARC optimization can cause both to fail.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Were this the case I think it would be a step in the wrong direction. Swift is getting<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; very eager at deallocating objects hence all the &quot;withXYZ()&quot; methods of late which<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; seem like noise to me. Certainly, having something perform differently from debug<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; to release builds was not a feature! Viva la Statement Scope which solves all this.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Statement scope is a brittle solution these problems. There&#39;s no shortage of C++ code that ends up subtly broken when it&#39;s refactored and ends up breaking due to hidden dependencies on statement scope.
