We are aware that the open source version of dispatch will not build on OS X due to missing dependencies. The one on GitHub is focused on the Linux port at the moment, but we will update the list if there is any change in the status of the dependencies required to build on OS X.<br></p><p>Thanks,<br>- Tony<br></p><p>&gt; On Jan 11, 2016, at 5:07 AM, Drew Crawford via swift-corelibs-dev &lt;swift-corelibs-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m having some trouble building libdispatch on el capitan.
