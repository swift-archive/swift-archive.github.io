Thoughts?<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; These functions correspond to C and LLVM primitives and we<br>&gt; consciously<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; kept those names because they are terms of art.<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; I recognize that this was the intention behind preserving the<br>&gt; names as-is.<br>&gt; &gt;     The<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; thought process behind proposing a renaming was as follows:<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; * The Swift counterpart to C `sizeof()` is `strideof(_:)`. Thus,<br>&gt; although<br>&gt; &gt;     the<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; *names* are treated as terms of art, not all of them are used to<br>&gt; mean the<br>&gt; &gt;     art<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; for which they are terms (if you will).<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     The specific meaning of sizeof in Swift comes from either LLVM or<br>&gt; from<br>&gt; &gt;     SIL, IIRC. It predates me, but it&#39;s supposed to correspond to what<br>&gt; the<br>&gt; &gt;     IRGen level of the compiler calls “sizeof.”<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; To reinforce the separation between C primitives and these Swift<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; functions, C `offsetof()` has no Swift counterpart.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     Yes, that&#39;s part of the reason I&#39;d very much like to choose more<br>&gt; &gt;     descriptive names if we are going to move away from the current<br>&gt; &gt;     spellings. moving the parenthesis is a pretty weak cue that this<br>&gt; thing<br>&gt; &gt;     might be slightly different.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; * A survey of other languages suggests that, as terms of art,<br>&gt; these names<br>&gt; &gt;     are<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; not always treated as a single word but as a phrase, by which I<br>&gt; mean that<br>&gt; &gt;     the<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; preposition &quot;of&quot; can be subject to language-specific naming<br>&gt; conventions.<br>&gt; &gt;     For<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; example, in Rust you have `size_of()`, `size_of_val()`, etc.; in<br>&gt; the .NET<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; Framework, you have the `Marshal.SizeOf()` method; and even in<br>&gt; LLVM you<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; apparently have (and this is based just on googling--my level of<br>&gt; &gt;     familiarity<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; with LLVM is low to nonexistent) struct `AlignOf&lt;T&gt;`.<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; I don&#39;t know that<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; size(of: T.self)<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; is particularly descriptive usage, and if we were going to change<br>&gt; them<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; so they didn&#39;t look like sizeof, strideof, alignof I&#39;d want to<br>&gt; make them<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; far more descriptive. E.g.<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; memoryFootprint(Int.self)<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; or<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; bytesRequiredForStorage(Int.self)<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; standardByteAlignment(Int.self)<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; bytesBetweenArrayElements(Int.self)<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; etc.<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; To my mind, `size(of:)` is not moving away from using a term of<br>&gt; art but<br>&gt; &gt;     rather<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; following existing precedent in conforming use of the preposition<br>&gt; to<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; language-specific conventions.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     The same argument could be made for “mapped” and “reduced.”<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; Like you, I would be hesitant to suggest moving away from these<br>&gt; terms<br>&gt; &gt;     &gt; of art altogether.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     You misunderstand me. I&#39;m not hesitant about that at all. What I<br>&gt; &gt;     dislike is the idea of being close-to-but-not-quite-the-same as the<br>&gt; &gt;     source terms to which they correspond. The original terms are not<br>&gt; &gt;     great, and these facilities are seldom used.
