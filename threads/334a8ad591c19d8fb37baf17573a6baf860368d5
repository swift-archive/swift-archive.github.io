MetalKit.framework is present in the iOS SDK, but not the iOS Simulator SDK.

But under Swift I couldn’t get the #if functionality to honor the TARGET_OS_SIMULATOR macro. My best way around was checking for a combination of the iOS platform with an i386 or x86_64 processor types using Swift’s #if functionality. This feels pretty hacky.

For example, AVFoundation is present in both the simulator and device SDKs, but AVFoundation is missing some API in simulator. In our existing iOS code, we also just check to see if we’re in a simulator target, and then just drop sections of code that require that API. Being able to check for the presence of a module doesn’t solve that problem. Another ask might be to have #if better support C macros. I can check something like TARGET_OS_SIMULATOR at runtime, but that doesn’t help me if I’m having issues at compile time because API or modules are missing in one SDK but not another. #if TARGET_OS_SIMULATOR is accepted by the Swift compiler, but the code within is never conditionally compiled no matter the current SDK.<br></p><p>Thanks!<br>Colin<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f38cb038c3d9ae705c4db3b5b5272906?s=50"></div><header><strong>#if Support for Module Presence</strong> from <string>Greg Parker</string> &lt;gparker at apple.com&gt;<p>January 27, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jan 26, 2016, at 8:35 PM, Colin Cornaby via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I was augmenting code that used OpenGL with a new Metal backend, but having some issues.
