It actually<br>uses an enum for the JSON types instead of objects, but it&#39;s split into<br>two components, the first is an event-based parser and the second is the<br>decoder that actually turns the events into the JSON enum. This means<br>that a trivial decoder can be written for the event-based stream that<br>emits plist objects instead of the JSON enum. Performance is decent, in<br>my tests it takes around 2.5-3x slower than NSJSONSerialization, but it<br>can probably be optimized a bit now that the Swift source is available<br>(or maybe the Swift stdlib can be optimized in certain relevant areas).<br>There&#39;s no encoder, but that&#39;s a lot easier to write than a decoder. The<br>event-stream parser itself operates over a sequence of UnicodeScalars<br>(and I have a helper that produces a UnicodeScalar stream from an NSData<br>to make parsing that easy).<br></p><p>The only real trouble I have with that is that, unfortunately,<br>dispatch_data_t does not have an external iterator for any subdata<br>blocks, and the internal iterator cannot be converted into an external<br>iterator (so it cannot be used to produce a<br>SequenceType&lt;UnicodeScalar&gt;), and furthermore the UTF8 type cannot<br>handle switching generators mid-stream (especially if one iterator only<br>yields part of a code point), which means that converting a<br>non-contiguous NSData to a sequence is going to have to copy all the<br>subdatas into one contiguous block. I&#39;m unsure if this is particularly<br>meaningful though, for any non-pathological JSON response, as most<br>real-world JSON responses probably fit into a single packet and<br>therefore will likely already be contiguous in memory when decoded.<br></p><p>My library does not yet have an encoder, but it should be pretty easy to<br>write one (it can be based on the same event stream model).<br></p><p>If interested, I&#39;d be happy to donate the library to the Swift project<br>to use as a basis for NSJSONSerialization (and hopefully even for a<br>non-object-based JSON API, e.g. the aforementioned enum). It&#39;s not<br>currently public, because I haven&#39;t actually written much in the way of<br>tests yet and I wanted to test it out in a real-world project before<br>releasing to the world (which was going to happen over the next few<br>weeks), but I can make it public now if there&#39;s interest in seeing it.<br></p><p>-Kevin Ballard<br></p><p>On Fri, Dec 4, 2015, at 05:33 AM, swizzlr wrote:<br>&gt; Sorry, forgot to include the link:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; http://zserge.com/jsmn.html<br>&gt; &gt; On 4 Dec 2015, at 13:33, swizzlr &lt;me at swizzlr.co&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; I would like to begin work on implementing NSJSONSerialization.
