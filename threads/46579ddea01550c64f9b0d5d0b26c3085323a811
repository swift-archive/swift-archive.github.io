IMO the minimal change that could possibly fit in Swift<br>&gt;     3 would be to allow static operator declarations and calls, and have the<br>&gt;     library declare the trampolines. If there&#39;s time to go further, I<br>&gt;     wouldn&#39;t necessarily be opposed, but at this point it&#39;s extremely late<br>&gt;     to do anything ambitious.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That&#39;s a reasonable compromise. My thinking was that it would be helpful for the<br>&gt; compiler to provide the trampoline implicitly for protocol operators because<br>&gt; it&#39;s likely to always be the same delegation, but since they can be written<br>&gt; manually in 1–2 lines of code, that&#39;s not a significant burden.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As you say, if making the operators themselves static is doable in the Swift 3<br>&gt; timeframe, a longer-term plan could auto-define the trampolines and the compiler<br>&gt; could either (1) flag ones identical to the would-be-auto-generated ones with a<br>&gt; warning that they&#39;re redundant, or (2) silently accept them. (If we<br>&gt; autogenerate, then we also have an open question: what do we do if the user<br>&gt; declares their own trampoline that differs from the expectation? Do we let them<br>&gt; override?)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     Keep in mind though that several people in the community have long held<br>&gt;     that operators should be regular members, which presumably would<br>&gt;     obsolete these static members. On the other hand, we don&#39;t have a<br>&gt;     design for that change, which I think would require defining a new set<br>&gt;     of lookup rules. This is probably an incremental step in the right<br>&gt;     direction.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; My &quot;regular members&quot;, do you mean that `a + b` would become something like `a.+<br>&gt; (b)`? (Sorry, I&#39;m entering some discussions late here.) <br></p><p>Not changing the calling syntax, but changing how they&#39;re declared (in<br>the body of one of the participating types, without `static`) and<br>something-that-has-yet-to-be-designed about how they&#39;re looked up.<br></p><p>&gt; I personally don&#39;t have a *strong* opposition to that, but I feel like<br>&gt; arbitrarily elevating the left-hand side to be a receiver instead of<br>&gt; an argument doesn&#39;t buy you much either. <br></p><p>Hey, I agree.  I&#39;ve never quite seen how this “regular members” plan is<br>going to work out.  Python and D do something for this that involves<br>awkward fallbacks to &quot;r&quot; versions of the operators for heterogeneous<br>argument types.  I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d want to repeat that in Swift.<br>Maybe your static-with-automatic-trampoline scheme is actually a better<br>long-term solution.
