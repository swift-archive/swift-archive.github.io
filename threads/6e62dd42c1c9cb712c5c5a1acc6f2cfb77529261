Scala (among I think a few other functional languages) implements `case` as a partial function inside closures.  <br></p><p>I actually use it quite widely, but not as often as I would use it if it were in Swift - since Scala also implements a match expression (which for the most part would be the same as the match function in Swift - with the exception that it does not need function brackets).  <br></p><p>Given that at most we will get a match expression or the partial function `case` structure - I would prefer the `case` structure because it gives us both. <br></p><p><br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160210/c466989d/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
