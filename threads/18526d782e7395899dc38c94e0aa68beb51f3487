It seems superficially<br>&gt;&gt; appealing at least. If your only motivation is to get 1.0 through 2.0 by<br>&gt;&gt; 0.1 to include 2.0, though, that feels like weak justification to me, since<br>&gt;&gt; that&#39;s a symptom of a different problem. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; This sounds like it reduces to the following:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1. Leave as is, broken, requiring workarounds for nearly all floating point cases<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2. Leave as is but remove floating point stride support, tick off<br>&gt; forloopians. Introduce floating point stride-alike,<br>&gt; which isn&#39;t terribly difficult but will need a different something since<br>&gt; `Stride` is built on `SignedNumberType`.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 3. (This) Introduce a fix to make floating point less sucky and integers<br>&gt; more semantically fitting, with<br>&gt; minimal code change. Issue FIXME warnings during migration to warn<br>&gt; against changed semantics.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 4. Do something else. Magic happens.

This proposal replaces the Swift&#39;s generic stride implementation with seperate algorithms for integer strides (the current implementation) and floating point strides.<br></p><p>This proposal was discussed on-list in the &quot;[Discussion] stride behavior and a little bit of a call-back to digital numbers&quot; &lt;http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution/8014&gt;thread.<br></p><p> &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/cf50f3dc54bb3a090933#motivation&gt;Motivation<br></p><p>Strideable is genericized across both integer and floating point types. A single implementation causes floating point strides to accumulate errors through repeatedly adding by intervals. Floating point types deserve their own floating point-aware implementation that minimizes errors.<br></p><p> &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/cf50f3dc54bb3a090933#current-art&gt;Current Art<br></p><p>A Strideable to sequence returns the sequence of values (self, self + stride, self + stride + stride, ... last) where last is the last value in the progression that is less than end.<br></p><p>A Strideable through sequence currently returns the sequence of values (self, self + stride, self + tride + stride, ... last) where last is the last value in the progression less than or equal to end. There is no guarantee that end is an element of the sequence.<br></p><p>While floating point calls present an extremely common use-case, they use integer-style math that accumulates errors during execution. Consider this example:<br></p><p>let ideal = [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0]<br>print(zip(Array(1.0.stride(through: 2.01, by: 0.1)), ideal).map(-))<br>// prints [0.0, 0.0, 2.2204460492503131e-16, 2.2204460492503131e-16, <br>// 4.4408920985006262e-16, 4.4408920985006262e-16, 4.4408920985006262e-16, <br>// 6.6613381477509392e-16, 6.6613381477509392e-16, 8.8817841970012523e-16, <br>// 8.8817841970012523e-16]<br>To create an array containing values from 1.0 to 2.0, the developer must add an epsilon value to the throughargument. Otherwise the stride progression ends near 1.9. Increasing the argument from 2.0 to 2.01 is sufficient to include the end value.<br>The errors in the sequence increase over time. You see this as errors become larger towards the end of the progress. This is an artifact of the generic implementation.<br> &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/cf50f3dc54bb3a090933#detail-design&gt;Detail Design<br></p><p>Under the current implementation, each floating point addition in a generic stride accrues errors. The following progression never reaches 2.0.<br></p><p>print(Array(1.0.stride(through: 2.0, by: 0.1)))<br>// Prints [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9]<br>This same issue occurs with traditional C-style for loops. This is an artifact of floating point math, and not the specific Swift statements:<br></p><p>var array: [Double] = []<br>for var i = 1.0; i &lt;= 2.0; i += 0.1 {<br>    array.append(i)<br>}<br>print(&quot;Array&quot;, array) <br>// Prints Array [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9]<br>You should not have to manually add an epsilon to force a progression to complete.<br></p><p>Floating point strides are inherently dissimilar to and should not be genericized with integer strides. I propose separate their implementation, freeing them to provide their own specialized progressions, using better numeric methods.

This proposal replaces the Swift&#39;s generic stride implementation with seperate algorithms for integer strides (the current implementation) and floating point strides.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This proposal was discussed on-list in the &quot;[Discussion] stride behavior and a little bit of a call-back to digital numbers&quot; &lt;http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution/8014&gt;thread.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/cf50f3dc54bb3a090933#motivation&gt;Motivation<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Strideable is genericized across both integer and floating point types. A single implementation causes floating point strides to accumulate errors through repeatedly adding by intervals. Floating point types deserve their own floating point-aware implementation that minimizes errors.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/cf50f3dc54bb3a090933#current-art&gt;Current Art<br>&gt; <br>&gt; A Strideable to sequence returns the sequence of values (self, self + stride, self + stride + stride, ... last) where last is the last value in the progression that is less than end.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; A Strideable through sequence currently returns the sequence of values (self, self + stride, self + tride + stride, ... last) where last is the last value in the progression less than or equal to end. There is no guarantee that end is an element of the sequence.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; While floating point calls present an extremely common use-case, they use integer-style math that accumulates errors during execution. Consider this example:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let ideal = [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0]<br>&gt; print(zip(Array(1.0.stride(through: 2.01, by: 0.1)), ideal).map(-))<br>&gt; // prints [0.0, 0.0, 2.2204460492503131e-16, 2.2204460492503131e-16, <br>&gt; // 4.4408920985006262e-16, 4.4408920985006262e-16, 4.4408920985006262e-16, <br>&gt; // 6.6613381477509392e-16, 6.6613381477509392e-16, 8.8817841970012523e-16, <br>&gt; // 8.8817841970012523e-16]<br>&gt; To create an array containing values from 1.0 to 2.0, the developer must add an epsilon value to the throughargument. Otherwise the stride progression ends near 1.9. Increasing the argument from 2.0 to 2.01 is sufficient to include the end value.<br>&gt; The errors in the sequence increase over time. You see this as errors become larger towards the end of the progress. This is an artifact of the generic implementation.<br>&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/cf50f3dc54bb3a090933#detail-design&gt;Detail Design<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Under the current implementation, each floating point addition in a generic stride accrues errors. The following progression never reaches 2.0.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; print(Array(1.0.stride(through: 2.0, by: 0.1)))<br>&gt; // Prints [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9]<br>&gt; This same issue occurs with traditional C-style for loops. This is an artifact of floating point math, and not the specific Swift statements:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; var array: [Double] = []<br>&gt; for var i = 1.0; i &lt;= 2.0; i += 0.1 {<br>&gt;     array.append(i)<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; print(&quot;Array&quot;, array) <br>&gt; // Prints Array [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9]<br>&gt; You should not have to manually add an epsilon to force a progression to complete.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Floating point strides are inherently dissimilar to and should not be genericized with integer strides. I propose separate their implementation, freeing them to provide their own specialized progressions, using better numeric methods. In doing so, floating point values are no longer tied to implementations that unnecessarily accrue errors or otherwise provide less-than-ideal solutions.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The following example provides a rough pass at what this might look like for floating point math. I leave specific algorithm details to experts; a decimal number solution would be more appropriate.

This proposal replaces the Swift&#39;s generic stride implementation with seperate algorithms for integer strides (the current implementation) and floating point strides.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; This proposal was discussed on-list in the &quot;[Discussion] stride behavior and a little bit of a call-back to digital numbers&quot; &lt;http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution/8014&gt;thread.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/cf50f3dc54bb3a090933#motivation&gt;Motivation<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Strideable is genericized across both integer and floating point types. A single implementation causes floating point strides to accumulate errors through repeatedly adding by intervals. Floating point types deserve their own floating point-aware implementation that minimizes errors.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/cf50f3dc54bb3a090933#current-art&gt;Current Art<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; A Strideable to sequence returns the sequence of values (self, self + stride, self + stride + stride, ... last) where last is the last value in the progression that is less than end.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; A Strideable through sequence currently returns the sequence of values (self, self + stride, self + tride + stride, ... last) where last is the last value in the progression less than or equal to end. There is no guarantee that end is an element of the sequence.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; While floating point calls present an extremely common use-case, they use integer-style math that accumulates errors during execution. Consider this example:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; let ideal = [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0]<br>&gt;&gt; print(zip(Array(1.0.stride(through: 2.01, by: 0.1)), ideal).map(-))<br>&gt;&gt; // prints [0.0, 0.0, 2.2204460492503131e-16, 2.2204460492503131e-16, <br>&gt;&gt; // 4.4408920985006262e-16, 4.4408920985006262e-16, 4.4408920985006262e-16, <br>&gt;&gt; // 6.6613381477509392e-16, 6.6613381477509392e-16, 8.8817841970012523e-16, <br>&gt;&gt; // 8.8817841970012523e-16]<br>&gt;&gt; To create an array containing values from 1.0 to 2.0, the developer must add an epsilon value to the throughargument. Otherwise the stride progression ends near 1.9. Increasing the argument from 2.0 to 2.01 is sufficient to include the end value.<br>&gt;&gt; The errors in the sequence increase over time. You see this as errors become larger towards the end of the progress. This is an artifact of the generic implementation.<br>&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/cf50f3dc54bb3a090933#detail-design&gt;Detail Design<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Under the current implementation, each floating point addition in a generic stride accrues errors. The following progression never reaches 2.0.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; print(Array(1.0.stride(through: 2.0, by: 0.1)))<br>&gt;&gt; // Prints [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9]<br>&gt;&gt; This same issue occurs with traditional C-style for loops. This is an artifact of floating point math, and not the specific Swift statements:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; var array: [Double] = []<br>&gt;&gt; for var i = 1.0; i &lt;= 2.0; i += 0.1 {<br>&gt;&gt;     array.append(i)<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Array&quot;, array) <br>&gt;&gt; // Prints Array [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9]<br>&gt;&gt; You should not have to manually add an epsilon to force a progression to complete.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Floating point strides are inherently dissimilar to and should not be genericized with integer strides. I propose separate their implementation, freeing them to provide their own specialized progressions, using better numeric methods. In doing so, floating point values are no longer tied to implementations that unnecessarily accrue errors or otherwise provide less-than-ideal solutions.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The following example provides a rough pass at what this might look like for floating point math. I leave specific algorithm details to experts; a decimal number solution would be more appropriate.

This proposal replaces the Swift&#39;s generic stride implementation with seperate algorithms for integer strides (the current implementation) and floating point strides.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This proposal was discussed on-list in the &quot;[Discussion] stride behavior and a little bit of a call-back to digital numbers&quot; &lt;http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution/8014&gt;thread.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/cf50f3dc54bb3a090933#motivation&gt;Motivation<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Strideable is genericized across both integer and floating point types. A single implementation causes floating point strides to accumulate errors through repeatedly adding by intervals. Floating point types deserve their own floating point-aware implementation that minimizes errors.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/cf50f3dc54bb3a090933#current-art&gt;Current Art<br>&gt; <br>&gt; A Strideable to sequence returns the sequence of values (self, self + stride, self + stride + stride, ... last) where last is the last value in the progression that is less than end.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; A Strideable through sequence currently returns the sequence of values (self, self + stride, self + tride + stride, ... last) where last is the last value in the progression less than or equal to end. There is no guarantee that end is an element of the sequence.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; While floating point calls present an extremely common use-case, they use integer-style math that accumulates errors during execution. Consider this example:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let ideal = [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0]<br>&gt; print(zip(Array(1.0.stride(through: 2.01, by: 0.1)), ideal).map(-))<br>&gt; // prints [0.0, 0.0, 2.2204460492503131e-16, 2.2204460492503131e-16, <br>&gt; // 4.4408920985006262e-16, 4.4408920985006262e-16, 4.4408920985006262e-16, <br>&gt; // 6.6613381477509392e-16, 6.6613381477509392e-16, 8.8817841970012523e-16, <br>&gt; // 8.8817841970012523e-16]<br>&gt; To create an array containing values from 1.0 to 2.0, the developer must add an epsilon value to the throughargument. Otherwise the stride progression ends near 1.9. Increasing the argument from 2.0 to 2.01 is sufficient to include the end value.<br>&gt; The errors in the sequence increase over time. You see this as errors become larger towards the end of the progress. This is an artifact of the generic implementation.<br>&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/cf50f3dc54bb3a090933#detail-design&gt;Detail Design<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Under the current implementation, each floating point addition in a generic stride accrues errors.

I agree with the premise that stride(to:by:) and<br>stride(through:by:) are poorly named, but I&#39;d like to make two<br>critiques of this proposal--<br></p><p>Critique 1:<br></p><p>The basic distinction between the two current stride styles is that<br>one is inclusive and the other is exclusive of the end value. I agree<br>with you that &quot;to&quot; doesn&#39;t imply an exclusive end value, but &quot;towards&quot;<br>doesn&#39;t imply that the parameter is any sort of end value at<br>all--rather, it implies just a direction (or as you quote from the<br>NOAD, getting close or closer).<br></p><p>Two implications:<br></p><p>First, if I stride from 10 towards 0 by 1, by the plain English<br>meaning of the word &quot;towards&quot;, I would expect to obtain 10, 9, 8, 7,<br>6, etc. If we simply rename stride(to:by:) to stride(towards:by:), I<br>would not get that result. By contrast, it makes sense from the<br>current name that stride(to:by:) attempts to increment using the `by`<br>parameter without considering whether the end value is greater than or<br>less than the start value; if you can&#39;t get from here &quot;to&quot; there by<br>such increments, too bad!<br></p><p>Second, if I stride from 0 towards 10 by 1 (in the English language,<br>not in Swift), I may or may not stop short of 10 itself. That is,<br>whether &quot;towards&quot; is inclusive or exclusive of the end value can&#39;t be<br>inferred from the meaning of the word; after all, if I&#39;m making<br>strides towards a goal, I do intend to reach it, or at least that&#39;s<br>what I tell people when they ask how my PhD is going...<br></p><p>Generalizing from the word &quot;towards&quot;, I don&#39;t know that any two<br>prepositions in the English language can be used unambiguously to<br>convey the distinction between inclusive and exclusive end values.<br>Although, on some additional thought--if I had to suggest a<br>preposition, perhaps &quot;until&quot; or &quot;till&quot; would be more apt than<br>&quot;towards&quot;.<br></p><p>The saving grace of &quot;to&quot; and &quot;through&quot; in the current situation is<br>that the latter seems intuitively to go further than the former, and<br>if one deduces by analogy with the range operators that one of these<br>must exclude the end value and the other include it, then the two<br>names must mean what they do today. With three stride styles and three<br>prepositions, but only two range operators, this intuition is broken,<br>while the prepositions may not get much clearer (though I must admit<br>that your proposed use of &quot;to&quot; is an improvement).<br></p><p>Critique 2:<br></p><p>The original motivation behind your twin proposals was the epsilon<br>adjustment necessary for floating point end values.

Values produced by throughdo not pass through an end point; they<br>&gt; stop at or before that fence. For example, 1.stride(through: 10, by: 8)<br>&gt; returns the progress (1, 9), not (1, 9, 17). Similarly, its to function<br>&gt; values reaches its end point. 1.stride(to:4, by:1) returns 1, 2, and 3. It<br>&gt; never makes it to 4:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The current Swift definition of to returns values in [start, end) and will<br>&gt; never reach end. In other words, you will never get to end.<br>&gt; The current Swift definition of through returns values in [start, end]. It<br>&gt; may never reach end and certainly never goes through that value.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Some definitions with the help of the New Oxford American Dictionary<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Moving to a value expresses &quot;a point reached at the end of a range&quot;.<br>&gt; To pass through a value, you should move beyond &quot;the position or location of<br>&gt; something beyond or at the far end of (an opening or an obstacle)&quot;.<br>&gt; To move towards a value is to get &quot;close or closer&quot; or &quot;getting closer to<br>&gt; achieving (a goal)&quot;.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Current Art<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A Strideable to sequence returns the sequence of values (self, self +<br>&gt; stride, self + stride + stride, ... last) where last is the last value in<br>&gt; the progression that is less than end.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A Strideable through sequence currently returns the sequence of values<br>&gt; (self, self + stride, self + tride + stride, ... last) where last is the<br>&gt; last value in the progression less than or equal to end. There is no<br>&gt; guarantee that end is an element of the sequence.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The name of the calling function through suggests the progression will pass<br>&gt; through the end point before stopping. It does not. The name to suggests a<br>&gt; progression will attempt to arrive at an end point. It does not.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Detail Design<br>&gt;<br>&gt; When striding to or through a number, the behavior does not match the<br>&gt; meaning of the word. Swift should provide three stride styles not two.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Style 1: [start, end) by interval<br>&gt; This style is currently called to. I propose to rename it towards as each<br>&gt; value works towards end. The final value in the progression is less than end<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Style 2: [start, end] by interval<br>&gt; This style is currently called through. I propose to rename it to. The<br>&gt; progression concludes with a value that is less than or equal to end. Swift<br>&gt; provides no guarantee that end is an element of the sequence.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Style 3: [start, &gt;=end] by interval<br>&gt; I propose to introduce a new style called through. The final value is<br>&gt; guaranteed to pass through end, either by finishing on end or past end. The<br>&gt; final value is strictly less than end + interval.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A Style 3 implementation works as follows:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; /// A `Strideable through` sequence currently returns the sequence of values<br>&gt; /// (`self`, `self + stride`, `self + stride + stride`, ... *last*) where<br>&gt; *last*<br>&gt; /// is the first value in the progression **greater than or equal to**<br>&gt; `end`.<br>&gt; /// There is no guarantee that `end` is an element of the sequence.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     /// Advance to the next element and return it, or `nil` if no next<br>&gt;     /// element exists.<br>&gt;     public mutating func next() -&gt; Element? {<br>&gt;         if done {<br>&gt;             return nil<br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;         if stride &gt; 0 ? current &gt;= end : current &lt;= end {<br>&gt;             done = true<br>&gt;             return current<br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;         let result = current<br>&gt;         current = current.advancedBy(stride)<br>&gt;         return result<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This solution is minimally disruptive to developers, respectful to existing<br>&gt; code bases, and introduces a more complete semantic set of progressions that<br>&gt; better matches progression names to developer expectations. (For example,<br>&gt; &quot;this argument says it goes through a value but it never even reaches that<br>&gt; value&quot;.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Upon adopting this change, out-of-sync strides now pass through end values:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // Unit stride<br>&gt; print(Array(1.stride(through: 10, by: 1)))<br>&gt; // prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], no change<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // Old out-of-sync stride<br>&gt; print(Array(1.stride(through: 10, by: 8)))<br>&gt; // prints [1, 9]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // New out-of-sync stride<br>&gt; print(Array(1.stride(through: 10, by: 8)))<br>&gt; // prints[1, 9, 17]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; There are no functional changes existing stride implementations. Only their<br>&gt; names change.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; print(Array(1.stride(towards: 10, by: 8))) // was `to`<br>&gt; // prints [1, 9]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; print(Array(1.stride(to: 10, by: 8))) // was `through`<br>&gt; // prints [1, 9]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Although floating point arithmetic presents a separate and orthogonal<br>&gt; challenge, its behavior changes if this proposal is implemented under the<br>&gt; current generic system. For example, through now includes a value at (or at<br>&gt; least close to) 2.0 instead of stopping at 1.9 due to accumulated floating<br>&gt; point errors.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // Old<br>&gt; print(Array(1.0.stride(through: 2.0, by: 0.1)))<br>&gt; // prints [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // New<br>&gt; print(Array(1.0.stride(through: 2.0, by: 0.1)))<br>&gt; // prints [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // Old, does not pass through 1.9<br>&gt; print(Array(1.0.stride(through: 1.9, by: 0.25)))<br>&gt; // prints [1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // New, passes through 1.9<br>&gt; print(Array(1.0.stride(through: 1.9, by: 0.25)))<br>&gt; // prints [1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Impact on Existing Code<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Renaming two stride functions and adding a third does not change or break<br>&gt; existing code. The Swift 3 migrator can easily update the names for the two<br>&gt; existing styles.

I agree<br>&gt; with you that &quot;to&quot; doesn&#39;t imply an exclusive end value, but &quot;towards&quot;<br>&gt; doesn&#39;t imply that the parameter is any sort of end value at<br>&gt; all--rather, it implies just a direction (or as you quote from the<br>&gt; NOAD, getting close or closer).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Two implications:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; First, if I stride from 10 towards 0 by 1, by the plain English<br>&gt; meaning of the word &quot;towards&quot;, I would expect to obtain 10, 9, 8, 7,<br>&gt; 6, etc. If we simply rename stride(to:by:) to stride(towards:by:), I<br>&gt; would not get that result. By contrast, it makes sense from the<br>&gt; current name that stride(to:by:) attempts to increment using the `by`<br>&gt; parameter without considering whether the end value is greater than or<br>&gt; less than the start value; if you can&#39;t get from here &quot;to&quot; there by<br>&gt; such increments, too bad!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Second, if I stride from 0 towards 10 by 1 (in the English language,<br>&gt; not in Swift), I may or may not stop short of 10 itself. That is,<br>&gt; whether &quot;towards&quot; is inclusive or exclusive of the end value can&#39;t be<br>&gt; inferred from the meaning of the word; after all, if I&#39;m making<br>&gt; strides towards a goal, I do intend to reach it, or at least that&#39;s<br>&gt; what I tell people when they ask how my PhD is going...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Generalizing from the word &quot;towards&quot;, I don&#39;t know that any two<br>&gt; prepositions in the English language can be used unambiguously to<br>&gt; convey the distinction between inclusive and exclusive end values.<br>&gt; Although, on some additional thought--if I had to suggest a<br>&gt; preposition, perhaps &quot;until&quot; or &quot;till&quot; would be more apt than<br>&gt; &quot;towards&quot;.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The saving grace of &quot;to&quot; and &quot;through&quot; in the current situation is<br>&gt; that the latter seems intuitively to go further than the former, and<br>&gt; if one deduces by analogy with the range operators that one of these<br>&gt; must exclude the end value and the other include it, then the two<br>&gt; names must mean what they do today. With three stride styles and three<br>&gt; prepositions, but only two range operators, this intuition is broken,<br>&gt; while the prepositions may not get much clearer (though I must admit<br>&gt; that your proposed use of &quot;to&quot; is an improvement).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Critique 2:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The original motivation behind your twin proposals was the epsilon<br>&gt; adjustment necessary for floating point end values. Your other<br>&gt; proposal fixes an issue with accumulated errors but doesn&#39;t solve the<br>&gt; need for an epsilon adjustment. Here, you propose adding a third<br>&gt; stride style to solve that problem, along the way shuffling the naming<br>&gt; of the existing stride styles. Since you haven&#39;t presented other use<br>&gt; cases for that third stride style here, and you haven&#39;t listed<br>&gt; alternatives considered for solving the original motivating problem<br>&gt; (i.e. epsilon adjustment), let me propose one alternative:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Keep the naming of stride styles as-is (inapt as they may be), and for<br>&gt; floating point end values make stride(through: aNumber, by: something)<br>&gt; equivalent to stride(to: theNextLargestRepresentableNumber, by:<br>&gt; somethingPositive) or stride(to: theNextSmallestRepresentableNumber,<br>&gt; by: somethingNegative). Would that solve your original issue<br>&gt; adequately?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Alternatively, if there are lots of examples that can be envisioned<br>&gt; for this third stride style, would the same examples suggest perhaps<br>&gt; that `..&gt;` might be a useful third range operator?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Mon, Feb 29, 2016 at 7:14 PM, Erica Sadun via swift-evolution<br>&gt; &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Feb 29, 2016, at 5:03 PM, Joe Groff &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; I agree, splitting into two proposals is a good idea.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -Joe<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Conventionalizing stride semantics<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Proposal: SE-00NN<br>&gt; Author(s): Erica Sadun<br>&gt; Status: TBD<br>&gt; Review manager: TBD<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Swift offers two stride functions, stride(to:, by:) and stride(through:,<br>&gt; by:). This proposal introduces a third style and renames the existing to<br>&gt; and<br>&gt; through styles.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This proposal was discussed on-list in the &quot;[Discussion] stride behavior<br>&gt; and<br>&gt; a little bit of a call-back to digital numbers&quot;thread.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Motivation<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Strideable&#39;s function names do not semantically match the progressions they<br>&gt; generate. Values produced by throughdo not pass through an end point; they<br>&gt; stop at or before that fence. For example, 1.stride(through: 10, by: 8)<br>&gt; returns the progress (1, 9), not (1, 9, 17). Similarly, its to function<br>&gt; values reaches its end point. 1.stride(to:4, by:1) returns 1, 2, and 3. It<br>&gt; never makes it to 4:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The current Swift definition of to returns values in [start, end) and will<br>&gt; never reach end. In other words, you will never get to end.<br>&gt; The current Swift definition of through returns values in [start, end]. It<br>&gt; may never reach end and certainly never goes through that value.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Some definitions with the help of the New Oxford American Dictionary<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Moving to a value expresses &quot;a point reached at the end of a range&quot;.<br>&gt; To pass through a value, you should move beyond &quot;the position or location<br>&gt; of<br>&gt; something beyond or at the far end of (an opening or an obstacle)&quot;.<br>&gt; To move towards a value is to get &quot;close or closer&quot; or &quot;getting closer to<br>&gt; achieving (a goal)&quot;.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Current Art<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A Strideable to sequence returns the sequence of values (self, self +<br>&gt; stride, self + stride + stride, ... last) where last is the last value in<br>&gt; the progression that is less than end.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A Strideable through sequence currently returns the sequence of values<br>&gt; (self, self + stride, self + tride + stride, ... last) where last is the<br>&gt; last value in the progression less than or equal to end. There is no<br>&gt; guarantee that end is an element of the sequence.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The name of the calling function through suggests the progression will pass<br>&gt; through the end point before stopping. It does not. The name to suggests a<br>&gt; progression will attempt to arrive at an end point. It does not.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Detail Design<br>&gt;<br>&gt; When striding to or through a number, the behavior does not match the<br>&gt; meaning of the word. Swift should provide three stride styles not two.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Style 1: [start, end) by interval<br>&gt; This style is currently called to. I propose to rename it towards as each<br>&gt; value works towards end. The final value in the progression is less than<br>&gt; end<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Style 2: [start, end] by interval<br>&gt; This style is currently called through. I propose to rename it to. The<br>&gt; progression concludes with a value that is less than or equal to end. Swift<br>&gt; provides no guarantee that end is an element of the sequence.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Style 3: [start, &gt;=end] by interval<br>&gt; I propose to introduce a new style called through. The final value is<br>&gt; guaranteed to pass through end, either by finishing on end or past end. The<br>&gt; final value is strictly less than end + interval.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A Style 3 implementation works as follows:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; /// A `Strideable through` sequence currently returns the sequence of<br>&gt; values<br>&gt; /// (`self`, `self + stride`, `self + stride + stride`, ... *last*) where<br>&gt; *last*<br>&gt; /// is the first value in the progression **greater than or equal to**<br>&gt; `end`.<br>&gt; /// There is no guarantee that `end` is an element of the sequence.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    /// Advance to the next element and return it, or `nil` if no next<br>&gt;    /// element exists.<br>&gt;    public mutating func next() -&gt; Element? {<br>&gt;        if done {<br>&gt;            return nil<br>&gt;        }<br>&gt;        if stride &gt; 0 ? current &gt;= end : current &lt;= end {<br>&gt;            done = true<br>&gt;            return current<br>&gt;        }<br>&gt;        let result = current<br>&gt;        current = current.advancedBy(stride)<br>&gt;        return result<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This solution is minimally disruptive to developers, respectful to existing<br>&gt; code bases, and introduces a more complete semantic set of progressions<br>&gt; that<br>&gt; better matches progression names to developer expectations. (For example,<br>&gt; &quot;this argument says it goes through a value but it never even reaches that<br>&gt; value&quot;.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Upon adopting this change, out-of-sync strides now pass through end values:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // Unit stride<br>&gt; print(Array(1.stride(through: 10, by: 1)))<br>&gt; // prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], no change<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // Old out-of-sync stride<br>&gt; print(Array(1.stride(through: 10, by: 8)))<br>&gt; // prints [1, 9]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // New out-of-sync stride<br>&gt; print(Array(1.stride(through: 10, by: 8)))<br>&gt; // prints[1, 9, 17]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; There are no functional changes existing stride implementations.

For example, through now includes a value at (or at<br>&gt; least close to) 2.0 instead of stopping at 1.9 due to accumulated floating<br>&gt; point errors.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // Old<br>&gt; print(Array(1.0.stride(through: 2.0, by: 0.1)))<br>&gt; // prints [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // New<br>&gt; print(Array(1.0.stride(through: 2.0, by: 0.1)))<br>&gt; // prints [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // Old, does not pass through 1.9<br>&gt; print(Array(1.0.stride(through: 1.9, by: 0.25)))<br>&gt; // prints [1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // New, passes through 1.9<br>&gt; print(Array(1.0.stride(through: 1.9, by: 0.25)))<br>&gt; // prints [1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Impact on Existing Code<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Renaming two stride functions and adding a third does not change or break<br>&gt; existing code.

By contrast, it makes sense from the<br>&gt; current name that stride(to:by:) attempts to increment using the `by`<br>&gt; parameter without considering whether the end value is greater than or<br>&gt; less than the start value; if you can&#39;t get from here &quot;to&quot; there by<br>&gt; such increments, too bad!<br></p><p>Do you want the stride to pick up the sign automatically? Instead of <br></p><p>print(Array(10.stride(to: 0, by: -1))) // [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], current Swift<br></p><p>have<br></p><p>print(Array(10.stride(to: 0, by: 1))) // [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], adjusted sign<br></p><p>Or am I missing your point of &quot;if I stride from 10 towards 0 by 1&quot;?<br></p><p><br>&gt; Second, if I stride from 0 towards 10 by 1 (in the English language,<br>&gt; not in Swift), I may or may not stop short of 10 itself. That is,<br>&gt; whether &quot;towards&quot; is inclusive or exclusive of the end value can&#39;t be<br>&gt; inferred from the meaning of the word; after all, if I&#39;m making<br>&gt; strides towards a goal, I do intend to reach it, or at least that&#39;s<br>&gt; what I tell people when they ask how my PhD is going...<br></p><p>I&#39;m searching for a word that means &quot;in the direction of but never reaching&quot;. <br></p><p>print(Array(10.stride(to: 0, by: -1))) // [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], current Swift<br></p><p>This never reaches 0.<br></p><p><br>&gt; Generalizing from the word &quot;towards&quot;, I don&#39;t know that any two<br>&gt; prepositions in the English language can be used unambiguously to<br>&gt; convey the distinction between inclusive and exclusive end values.<br>&gt; Although, on some additional thought--if I had to suggest a<br>&gt; preposition, perhaps &quot;until&quot; or &quot;till&quot; would be more apt than<br>&gt; &quot;towards&quot;.<br></p><p>`until` to me suggests reaching the end-point.<br></p><p>&gt; The saving grace of &quot;to&quot; and &quot;through&quot; in the current situation is<br>&gt; that the latter seems intuitively to go further than the former,<br></p><p>Quite often, it doesn&#39;t really:<br></p><p>print(Array(1.stride(to:10, by: 8))) // [1, 9]<br>print(Array(1.stride(through:10, by: 8))) // [1, 9]<br></p><p><br>&gt; and<br>&gt; if one deduces by analogy with the range operators that one of these<br>&gt; must exclude the end value and the other include it, then the two<br>&gt; names must mean what they do today. With three stride styles and three<br>&gt; prepositions, but only two range operators, this intuition is broken,<br>&gt; while the prepositions may not get much clearer (though I must admit<br>&gt; that your proposed use of &quot;to&quot; is an improvement).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Critique 2:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The original motivation behind your twin proposals was the epsilon<br>&gt; adjustment necessary for floating point end values. Your other<br>&gt; proposal fixes an issue with accumulated errors but doesn&#39;t solve the<br>&gt; need for an epsilon adjustment.<br></p><p>Actually, I&#39;ve tweaked it this morning to take care of that.

Since you haven&#39;t presented other use<br>&gt; cases for that third stride style here, and you haven&#39;t listed<br>&gt; alternatives considered for solving the original motivating problem<br>&gt; (i.e. epsilon adjustment), let me propose one alternative:<br></p><p>Canonical use-cases for all three styles:<br></p><p>1 towards 5 by 1: [1, 2, 3, 4] <br>This style mimics a..&lt;b but allows non-unit and negative progressions<br></p><p>1 to 5 by 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>This style mimics a...b but allows non-unit and negative progressions<br></p><p>1 through 10 by 8: [1, 9, 17]<br>This style ensures a non-unit and negative progression that passes to or through the final value, <br>ensuring that the range of the progression fully includes the range of the from and to values:<br>[first...last] subsumes [from...through].

Would that solve your original issue<br>&gt; adequately?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Alternatively, if there are lots of examples that can be envisioned<br>&gt; for this third stride style, would the same examples suggest perhaps<br>&gt; that `..&gt;` might be a useful third range operator? <br></p><p>I like that quite a lot actually.<br></p><p><br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160301/5e1dd0dd/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5451f7df31d36d0159a018706aec7adb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal] Conventionalizing stride semantics</strong> from <string>Erica Sadun</string> &lt;erica at ericasadun.com&gt;<p>March  1, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Mar 1, 2016, at 10:36 AM, Erica Sadun via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Mar 1, 2016, at 1:54 AM, Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com &lt;mailto:xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; It&#39;s so nice to see such care devoted to clarifying these existing<br>&gt;&gt; names.

You&#39;ve phrased the<br>&gt; &gt; problem to be solved this way: &quot;this thing says it goes through and it<br>&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t, this thing says it goes to and it doesn&#39;t&quot;.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I can see why you&#39;d see this as one single issue. You want the things<br>&gt; &gt; to do what they say. And we very much still need the current function<br>&gt; &gt; of stride(to:by:), so you rename that &#39;towards&#39;. That&#39;s how you end up<br>&gt; &gt; with three stride styles instead of two.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t been thinking of it in that way. I see what you&#39;re proposing<br>&gt; &gt; here as two discrete concerns:<br>&gt; &gt; 1. You think the current things are poorly named. You propose<br>&gt; &gt; different names for them.<br>&gt; &gt; 2. You think we need a new third thing. You propose a new thing.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; My feedback, in a nutshell, is that I agree with you on the issue<br>&gt; &gt; you&#39;ve identified in (1), but I quibble about the exact names--I&#39;m<br>&gt; &gt; sure whatever is adopted will be great, though. (And thank you for<br>&gt; &gt; taking the time to describe the problem and drive this!)<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; However, I&#39;m not convinced that (2) is an issue. Reading your revised<br>&gt; &gt; gist, I&#39;m still not convinced. I see one example about graph axes. As<br>&gt; &gt; it happens, I&#39;m about to write some code to plot some stuff, and I<br>&gt; &gt; haven&#39;t been regretting the lack of this third stride style. The<br>&gt; &gt; reason is that I very much need to compute the top of the axis before<br>&gt; &gt; I start striding through anything. Drawing axis tick marks comes quite<br>&gt; &gt; a bit after computing the axis limits. And once I&#39;ve got the axis<br>&gt; &gt; limits, I can use the second stride style. So, no convincing use case<br>&gt; &gt; yet, imho.
