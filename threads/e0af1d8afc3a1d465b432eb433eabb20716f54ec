I think it&#39;s worth considering whether Equatable, Hashable, and/or Comparable, instead of being explicit protocols, should become universal behavior like &#39;print&#39;, with customization points to override the default behavior. If Equatable and Hashable behavior were universal, that would solve many of the common problems people currently have trying to work with heterogeneous containers. In object-oriented frameworks, including Cocoa, Java, and .NET, it is common for the root (NS)Object class to provide default equality and hashing operations. There are of course some tradeoffs:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - Universal behavior would require us to either generate code for &#39;==&#39;, &#39;hashValue&#39;, and/or &#39;&lt;&#39; for every type, or provide sufficient reflection info for a common runtime implementation to do it. The reflection-based approach may be reasonable for print(), since dumping reflection info only reduces the quality of the default logging behavior, but &#39;==&#39; and &#39;hashValue&#39; are more essential to proper behavior, so relying on reflection might be too slow, and would be brittle when we introduce the ability to drop reflection info.<br>&gt; - Type safety with &#39;==&#39; is important to prevent accidental &#39;1 == &quot;1&quot;&#39; type comparsions, and a fully generic &#39;func ==&lt;T&gt;(x: T, y: T) -&gt; Bool&#39; could potentially allow those sorts of mixed-type comparisons by accident. Language rules that constrained when generic parameters can be resolved to supertypes might help here.<br>&gt; - Function types in Swift do not provide a ready equality operation. We could provide a default implementation that always returns &#39;false&#39;, perhaps.<br>&gt; - A Comparable ordering can be dreamt up for many types, but it&#39;s not always a stable ordering, or a desired one. Many people have complained that &#39;nil &lt; .Some(1)&#39; works for optionals, for instance, ordering &#39;nil&#39; below Some values. We could use pointer identity to order class instances and types, but this wouldn&#39;t be a stable ordering across process runs. That might be good enough for ordered collections like search trees, but is weaker than what many people expect &#39;&lt;&#39; to do.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It&#39;s my feeling that Equatable and Hashable would make a lot of sense as universal operations; I&#39;m not so sure about Comparable.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Joe<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160308/0e2d6396/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d53b7c5f9b5f5557b9082face9b632a0?s=50"></div><header><strong>Universal Equatability, Hashability, and Comparability</strong> from <string>Dave Abrahams</string> &lt;dabrahams at apple.com&gt;<p>March  9, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>on Tue Mar 08 2016, Jordan Rose &lt;jordan_rose-AT-apple.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Agreed.

It might not be useful, but it&#39;s not wrong.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I don&#39;t think the same applies for equatability. The universal default behavior for equating two objects is either correct or incorrect, and it&#39;s not possible to know beforehand which is which. One of the wonderful things about the current Swift system is that (modulo some exceptional cases) only things explicitly meant to be equatable with each other are comparable. We avoid the object-oriented pitfall in which &#39;equality&#39; means two different things - equality of value if you implemented an override properly; a default &#39;equality of instance&#39; otherwise (which might be right or wrong). Of course, the same pitfall wouldn&#39;t necessarily apply in our case, but the problem of having a &#39;default&#39; == impl that allows a developer to falsely assume their type is being properly compared (or not think about it at all) would still be present.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Best,<br>&gt; Austin<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Tue, Mar 8, 2016 at 2:02 PM, Brian Pratt via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; Definitely a +1 on the basics.

I think it&#39;s worth considering whether Equatable, Hashable, and/or Comparable, instead of being explicit protocols, should become universal behavior like &#39;print&#39;, with customization points to override the default behavior. If Equatable and Hashable behavior were universal, that would solve many of the common problems people currently have trying to work with heterogeneous containers. In object-oriented frameworks, including Cocoa, Java, and .NET, it is common for the root (NS)Object class to provide default equality and hashing operations. There are of course some tradeoffs:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - Universal behavior would require us to either generate code for &#39;==&#39;, &#39;hashValue&#39;, and/or &#39;&lt;&#39; for every type, or provide sufficient reflection info for a common runtime implementation to do it. The reflection-based approach may be reasonable for print(), since dumping reflection info only reduces the quality of the default logging behavior, but &#39;==&#39; and &#39;hashValue&#39; are more essential to proper behavior, so relying on reflection might be too slow, and would be brittle when we introduce the ability to drop reflection info.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - Type safety with &#39;==&#39; is important to prevent accidental &#39;1 == &quot;1&quot;&#39; type comparsions, and a fully generic &#39;func ==&lt;T&gt;(x: T, y: T) -&gt; Bool&#39; could potentially allow those sorts of mixed-type comparisons by accident. Language rules that constrained when generic parameters can be resolved to supertypes might help here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - Function types in Swift do not provide a ready equality operation. We could provide a default implementation that always returns &#39;false&#39;, perhaps.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - A Comparable ordering can be dreamt up for many types, but it&#39;s not always a stable ordering, or a desired one. Many people have complained that &#39;nil &lt; .Some(1)&#39; works for optionals, for instance, ordering &#39;nil&#39; below Some values. We could use pointer identity to order class instances and types, but this wouldn&#39;t be a stable ordering across process runs. That might be good enough for ordered collections like search trees, but is weaker than what many people expect &#39;&lt;&#39; to do.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s my feeling that Equatable and Hashable would make a lot of sense as universal operations; I&#39;m not so sure about Comparable.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -Joe<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160311/1293d9d4/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d53b7c5f9b5f5557b9082face9b632a0?s=50"></div><header><strong>Universal Equatability, Hashability, and Comparability</strong> from <string>Dave Abrahams</string> &lt;dabrahams at apple.com&gt;<p>March  9, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>on Tue Mar 08 2016, Brian Pratt &lt;brian-AT-pratt.io&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Definitely a +1 on the basics.

The reflection-based<br>&gt;&gt; approach may be reasonable for print(), since dumping reflection info only<br>&gt;&gt; reduces the quality of the default logging behavior, but &#39;==&#39; and<br>&gt;&gt; &#39;hashValue&#39; are more essential to proper behavior, so relying on reflection<br>&gt;&gt; might be too slow, and would be brittle when we introduce the ability to<br>&gt;&gt; drop reflection info.<br>&gt;&gt; - Type safety with &#39;==&#39; is important to prevent accidental &#39;1 == &quot;1&quot;&#39; type<br>&gt;&gt; comparsions, and a fully generic &#39;func ==&lt;T&gt;(x: T, y: T) -&gt; Bool&#39; could<br>&gt;&gt; potentially allow those sorts of mixed-type comparisons by accident.<br>&gt;&gt; Language rules that constrained when generic parameters can be resolved to<br>&gt;&gt; supertypes might help here.<br>&gt;&gt; - Function types in Swift do not provide a ready equality operation. We<br>&gt;&gt; could provide a default implementation that always returns &#39;false&#39;, perhaps.<br>&gt;&gt; - A Comparable ordering can be dreamt up for many types, but it&#39;s not<br>&gt;&gt; always a stable ordering, or a desired one. Many people have complained<br>&gt;&gt; that &#39;nil &lt; .Some(1)&#39; works for optionals, for instance, ordering &#39;nil&#39;<br>&gt;&gt; below Some values. We could use pointer identity to order class instances<br>&gt;&gt; and types, but this wouldn&#39;t be a stable ordering across process runs. That<br>&gt;&gt; might be good enough for ordered collections like search trees, but is<br>&gt;&gt; weaker than what many people expect &#39;&lt;&#39; to do.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; It&#39;s my feeling that Equatable and Hashable would make a lot of sense as<br>&gt;&gt; universal operations; I&#39;m not so sure about Comparable.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; -Joe<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>Universal Equatability, Hashability, and Comparability</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>March  8, 2016 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; - Function types in Swift do not provide a ready equality operation.

For instance, anything that<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; includes a cache will be incorrect.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; Anything that includes a pointer to a buffer and ought to evaluate the<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; buffer&#39;s contents will be incorrect.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; Anything that includes a closure will be incorrect. Individually, each<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; of these cases is minor, but they multiply and interact with each<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; other until, together, they undermine confidence in ==.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; These things wouldn&#39;t be Regular by themselves.  To make them<br>&gt;&gt; composable, you can create a single Regular value type that wraps each<br>&gt;&gt; one.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; &gt; If you explicitly mark things as Equatable, then it is clear that the<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; equality operator on them really does have a sensible definition.

If everything&#39;s Equatable, then nothing is.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; Auto-deriving is a different story, though, especially if it&#39;s opt-in<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; (you have to say `deriving Equatable`).

However, I doubt that the comparison of (really?) weird types are very frequent.

I&#39;m unsure what to do<br>about these two, but they bear careful consideration.<br></p><p>&gt; - A Comparable ordering can be dreamt up for many types, but it&#39;s not<br>&gt; always a stable ordering, <br></p><p>What do you mean by stable ordering?<br></p><p>&gt; or a desired one. <br></p><p>That&#39;s true.  But what&#39;s important is that it&#39;s consistent with == and<br>allows lookup in a sorted container.  The core ordering operation should<br>not be spelled &quot;&lt;&quot; though; we should use &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot; for that so that types<br>can keep their domain-specific &quot;&lt;&quot; if necessary.  Too bad the same trick<br>doesn&#39;t work for &quot;==&quot; :-).<br></p><p>&gt; Many people have complained that &#39;nil &lt; .Some(1)&#39; works for optionals,<br>&gt; for instance, ordering &#39;nil&#39; below Some values. We could use pointer<br>&gt; identity to order class instances and types, but this wouldn&#39;t be a<br>&gt; stable ordering across process runs. <br></p><p>Oh, that&#39;s what you mean by &quot;stable.&quot;  So what?<br></p><p>&gt; That might be good enough for ordered collections like search trees,<br>&gt; but is weaker than what many people expect &#39;&lt;&#39; to do.<br></p><p>MMmph.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable to say that if your expectations<br>don&#39;t match the defaults, you can define your own.<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/06c1dcc7dce6a93d194b9c013376e3f0?s=50"></div><header><strong>Universal Equatability, Hashability, and Comparability</strong> from <string>Joe Groff</string> &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt;<p>March  9, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Mar 9, 2016, at 11:41 AM, Dave Abrahams &lt;dabrahams at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; or a desired one. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; That&#39;s true.
