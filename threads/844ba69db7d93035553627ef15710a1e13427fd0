One<br>&gt; example of its use is something like<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   // Iterate over self.view and all its ancestor views.<br>&gt;   for view in unfold(self.view, applying: { $0.superview }) {<br>&gt;       // ...<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In fact, just today I hit this exact issue and wished I had<br>&gt; unfold(). This same pattern works for any case where an object has a<br>&gt; property of the same type and you want to walk the entire chain, such<br>&gt; as UIViewController.presentingViewController, or<br>&gt; NSError.userInfo[NSUnderlyingErrorKey].<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It also integrates very nicely with the other sequence methods,<br>&gt; including drop(while:) and prefix(while:). For example:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   // Iterate over someView and all its ancestors, stopping at<br>&gt; self.view<br>&gt;   for view in unfold(someView, applying: { $0.superview<br>&gt; }).prefix(while: { $0 !== self.view }) {<br>&gt;       // ...<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Incidentally, I tried writing up an example of using the stateful<br>&gt; version to reimplement zip(), but it ended up being a good argument in<br>&gt; favor of the suggestion someone (maybe you?) had for turning the state<br>&gt; into an inout parameter.<br></p><p>Thanks for the credit, but I think it goes to Joe Groff.  He&#39;s been<br>suggesting we do the same thing for reduce().<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
