I pointed out arm-linux target with &quot;xcrun -sdk macosx&quot; before swiftc, so all targets unless native were rejected. But I have once more interesting question about compiler behaviour.<br>All below written actions are done on Mac. I invoke swiftc:<br>1) without xcrun<br>2) with native target x86_64-apple-macosx10.9<br>3) with -c option and one short-length source .swift-file, that create simple custom ObjC instance<br>4) with -import-objc-header option and name of .h-file, that contains one line #import &quot;C.h&quot;, where my simple custom interface is declared<br>5) with Xcc -I options, which contain paths to ObjC open source frameworks and ObjC open source runtime (not native)<br>The result is bridging header is successfully imported, so open source frameworks, pointed out at XCcc -I, are found and used.<br></p><p>Then let us do another experiment. Write --target=arm-linux-gnueabi and add -I&lt;path to armv7-linux-gnueabi swift.swiftmodule&gt;, where arm-linux module was build within native environment on linux host. In that case, bridging header import is failed, code failed within CLangImporter::importHeader() since many, many errors in clang diagnostics: cland does not understand any ObjC expression or classname in my headers and can not build AST. I think, this phenomena is explained by some differences in swift.swiftmodule, built on mac and on linux. So, my question is: what just exactly this difference is? What part of swift.swiftmodule is reponsible for such behaviour and where this part is analyzed in compiler source code? Thanks in advance for answer this interesting question.<br></p><p><br>17.03.2016, 22:32, &quot;Труб Илья via swift-dev&quot; &lt;swift-dev at swift.org&gt;:<br>&gt; Dear colleagues,<br>&gt; It seems to me, something was happened with cross-compilation on MacOS.
