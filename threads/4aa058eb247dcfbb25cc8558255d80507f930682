I would prefer to have our own implementation of the JSON parser<br>&gt; in Foundation rather than use one from another project.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The one from Darwin is about 2k lines of Objective-C (actually, mostly<br>&gt; C).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - Tony<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; On Dec 4, 2015, at 11:21 AM, Tom Leavy &lt;tom at wickr.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; I was wondering what the official position on introducing dependencies currently is. I would love to contribute an implementation of NSJSONSerialization. I already have written a wrapper that uses yajl to take a CFDictionaryRef or CFArrayRef and encodes them into CFDataRef or CFStringRef JSON values.. Is it acceptable to use yajl and introduce a dependency, or is it a goal of the foundation project to supply its own implementation of a JSON parser?<br>&gt; &gt; This e-mail message is intended only for the named recipient(s) above and is covered by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act 18 U.S.C.
