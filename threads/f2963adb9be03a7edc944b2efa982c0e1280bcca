A semicolon-separated list of heterogeneous items:<br>- a declaration and/or initialization;<br>- a boolean expression;<br>- a statement which is executed not there, but between loop iterations.<br></p><p>I do remember in the early C days that (some) people delighted in<br>cramming stuff inside the for header and have an empty loop body. This<br>was fun, but needlessly obscure/tricky. Enumerating a linked list was a<br>frequent sample.<br></p><p>Also, for many purposes one had to use tricks, like extra booleans, or a<br>switch on the index, to special-handle the first or last time through<br>the loop.<br></p><p>Substituting a `while` loop can be, as many have already pointed out,<br>seriously problematic when `break`, `continue` and `throw` are used<br>inside the loop, and `defer` is not a good solution for that, either.<br></p><p>So, I propose that the `while` loop should get an optional `repeat`<br>clause at the end, like this:<br></p><p>var item = firstItem		// declaration/initialization<br>while item != nil {	// condition<br>	if SomeExtraCondition(item) {<br>		break;<br>	}<br>	process(item)<br>} repeat {			// increment<br>	item = NextItemFor(item)<br>}<br></p><p>Where the statements inside `repeat` are executed after each loop, but<br>only if the loop will continue. I think this offers the necessary<br>conceptual clearness and existing for-loops are easily converted<br>automatically. The eye will skip over the `repeat` clause for the last<br>iteration as it now does for `else`.<br></p><p>Also, `break`, `continue` and `throw` will all continue to work as expected.<br></p><p>I also propose that the `repeat` clause be extended to the remaining<br>`for-in` loop:<br></p><p>for item in sequence {<br>	print(&quot;\(item)&quot;)<br>} repeat {<br>	print(&quot;, &quot;)<br>}<br></p><p>which will be handy in many situations.<br></p><p>Finally, I think that `for i in 0..&lt;n` is acceptable for counting.<br>Having reverse ranges would help but is not as frequent.<br></p><p>BTW: `loop` or whatever is felt to be more readable could be used in<br>place of `repeat`.<br></p><p>	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change<br>to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes, I do think that it will remove a source of errors for programmers<br>migrating in from C/C++/ObjC, and the &quot;repeat&quot; clause will offer a more<br>functionality for the loops.<br></p><p>	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes.<br></p><p>	* If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar<br>feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>I&#39;ve used C/ObjC extensively for decades, older languages are probably<br>not useful by now :-)<br></p><p>	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick<br>reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>I&#39;ve read (and now, re-read most comments on this list. I haven&#39;t<br>checked the Swift sources for implementation implications (nor do I feel<br>yet qualified to do so).<br></p><p>-- <br>Rainer Brockerhoff  &lt;rainer at brockerhoff.net&gt;<br>Belo Horizonte, Brazil<br>&quot;In the affairs of others even fools are wise<br>In their own business even sages err.&quot;<br>http://brockerhoff.net/blog/<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc3a9ea0c6c870343d9acb4ac3059cdc?s=50"></div><header><strong>Review for: Remove C-style for-loops with conditions and incrementers</strong> from <string>Matthew Johnson</string> &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt;<p>December 12, 2015 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; <br>&gt; So, I propose that the `while` loop should get an optional `repeat`<br>&gt; clause at the end, like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; var item = firstItem		// declaration/initialization<br>&gt; while item != nil {	// condition<br>&gt; 	if SomeExtraCondition(item) {<br>&gt; 		break;<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; 	process(item)<br>&gt; } repeat {			// increment<br>&gt; 	item = NextItemFor(item)<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Where the statements inside `repeat` are executed after each loop, but<br>&gt; only if the loop will continue.

It feels “Swifty” and seems like a win to me.  <br></p><p>I can’t think of any reason to oppose the proposal with Ranier’s solution other than old habits, familiarity from other languages, etc.<br></p><p>I do think we need to consider whether “repeat” is the best keyword due to potential confusion with &quot;repeat while” loops.

It&#39;s easily recognizable to those who already know the C-style for loop, easier to understand to those who don&#39;t, and it does not force all C-style for loops to be rewritten using a different control flow.<br></p><p>Moreover, if you accompany this change with a fix-it having a special case that migrates the old forms &quot;for;;&quot; and &quot;for(;;)&quot; by proposing the appropriate range-based for-in loop as a replacement for simple forward iteration over integers, beginners writing &quot;for;;&quot; will likely switch to using the for-in form after being shown the way once or twice.<br></p><p><br>-- <br>Michel Fortin<br>michel.fortin at michelf.ca<br>https://michelf.ca<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49f329a0267f5a1773a77017882a82a8?s=50"></div><header><strong>Review for: Remove C-style for-loops with conditions and incrementers</strong> from <string>Rainer Brockerhoff</string> &lt;rainer at brockerhoff.net&gt;<p>December 12, 2015 at 09:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On 12/12/15 17:48, Michel Fortin wrote:<br>&gt; It&#39;d certainly be useful if the C-style for loop disappear to have a<br>&gt; decent way to express it using a while loop, but I&#39;m not sure this is<br>&gt; the way to go.
