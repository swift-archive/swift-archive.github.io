The proposal has been *accepted*,<br>&gt; with modifications:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; * The core team agrees that we should rename all of the existing<br>&gt; __FILE__, __LINE__, __COLUMN__, __FUNCTION__, and __DSO_HANDLE__<br>&gt; symbols to lowercase equivalents in the # namespace: #file, #line,<br>&gt; #column, #function, #dsohandle.  This includes keeping __FUNCTION__,<br>&gt; and making #line have the dual behavior of being a directive when it<br>&gt; is the first token on a line, but an expression otherwise.  Renaming<br>&gt; these symbols improves uniformity within the Swift language, and<br>&gt; keeping all of them provides a smooth transition path from the old<br>&gt; syntax to the new syntax.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; * The core team isn’t thrilled with the magic “first token on a line”<br>&gt; whitespace behavior that #line will be getting, and would like someone<br>&gt; to start a discussion about renaming the old #line directive to<br>&gt; something more specific and tailored to its purpose.  Once that name<br>&gt; and syntax is settled, we can rename the directive and remove the<br>&gt; whitespace rule.<br></p><p>I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll ultimately need to solve this some other way than by<br>choosing a different name.  We&#39;re eventually going to end up with<br>something meaning #sourceLocation (modulo capitalization) and that&#39;s<br>obviously (IMO) going to be the right name for both entities.<br></p><p>&gt; * The core team requests that #symbol be split out into a separate<br>&gt; proposal, because it needs more detailed design work, and is an<br>&gt; additive feature.  For example, it might be appealing to provide a<br>&gt; &quot;#mangledName” expression that provides the current symbol as a<br>&gt; mangled name: when fed into a demangler, a more structured form of the<br>&gt; current symbol would be available.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Thank you to Erica Sadun for driving this forward!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -Chris Lattner<br>&gt; Review Manager<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5451f7df31d36d0159a018706aec7adb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Accepted] SE-0028 Modernizing Swift&#39;s Debugging Identifiers (__LINE__, etc)</strong> from <string>Erica Sadun</string> &lt;erica at ericasadun.com&gt;<p>February  4, 2016 at 08:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Feb 4, 2016, at 1:24 AM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll ultimately need to solve this some other way than by<br>&gt; choosing a different name.
