SourceKit?</strong> from <string>Brian Gesiak</string> &lt;modocache at gmail.com&gt;<p>April  3, 2016 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Hello all!<br></p><p>SR-710 &lt;https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-710&gt; tracks a major goal for Swift<br>3: having SwiftPM/corelibs-xctest automatically generate a list of test<br>methods to execute. The implementations we’re considering span various<br>parts of the codebase: libIDE, SourceKit, the reflection APIs, etc. We need<br>input from people familiar with these components.<br></p><p>Here’s the issue: currently, users of corelibs-xctest must manually list<br>each test they wish to execute:<br></p><p>class MyTestCase: XCTestCase {<br>    static var allTests: [(String, MyTestCase -&gt; () throws -&gt; Void)] {<br>        return [<br>            (&quot;testFoo&quot;, testFoo)<br>        ]<br>    }<br></p><p>    func testFoo() {<br>        XCTAssert(true)<br>    }<br></p><p>    // The user forgot to list this method in `allTests`, so it is never run.<br>    func testBar() {<br>        XCTAssert(true)<br>    }<br>}<br></p><p>This is tedious and error-prone. We need to do better by Swift 3!<br></p><p>Apple XCTest uses Objective-C reflection at runtime to compile a list of<br>NSInvocation to execute as tests. We can’t use the same approach in Swift:<br>as far as I know, there’s no reflection API that allows us to find instance<br>methods defined on a class, and adding such an API is considered a stretch<br>goal for Swift 3<br>&lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20151207/001682.html&gt;<br>.<br></p><p>Several commenters in SR-710 &lt;https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-710&gt; have<br>suggested using libIDE or SourceKit to determine the list of tests. I<br>believe this is the most feasible approach that could be implemented in<br>time for Swift 3. A few caveats:<br></p><p>   - SourceKit is coupled to XPC, which only works on OS X.<br>   - Logic like SourceKit::FuncDeclEntityInfo.IsTestCandidate<br>   &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/12593eff135ab2fa99529e9fa8ecc61ce268cd45/tools/SourceKit/include/SourceKit/Core/LangSupport.h#L54&gt;<br>   exists in SourceKit, but not libIDE.<br>   - libIDE defines a C++ interface, so we could not use it from Swift<br>   (should we choose to use Swift to generate the list of test methods).<br></p><p>I think we have three concrete options for implementing SR-710<br>&lt;https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-710&gt;:<br></p><p>   1. Port SourceKit to Linux, using a different form of IPC since XPC is<br>   not available.<br>   2. Move business logic like IsTestCandidate to libIDE. If the tool to<br>   generate the list of tests will be written in Swift, we can add a C header<br>   (like libclang or sourcekitd). The tool would link against libIDE and use<br>   the C header.<br>   3. Move business logic like IsTestCandidate to libIDE and add a swiftc<br>   option to interface with its functionality. The tool that generates the<br>   list of tests would invoke swiftc to get the list.<br></p><p>I think #2 is the best option. It’s less work than both #1 and #3. I<br>believe logic like IsTestCandidate belongs in libIDE anyway—SourceKit<br>should stick to XPC and asynchronous communication with libIDE.<br></p><p>Not being an expert in many of these components, I have several questions:<br></p><p>   - I’m assuming the reflection API to return a list of instance methods<br>   on a XCTestCase subclass is not ready yet, and won’t be for some time.<br>   Is this accurate?<br>   - I’m assuming that SourceKit is intended to be an asynchronous wrapper<br>   over libIDE, and that logic like IsTestCandidate should be moved to<br>   libIDE. Is this accurate?<br>   - I’m assuming that SourceKit is coupled with XPC, and that it would be<br>   more work to port it to Linux than it would be to move its logic to libIDE.<br>   Is this accurate?<br></p><p>If you have thoughts/feedback, please reply to this email or comment on<br>SR-710 &lt;https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-710&gt;. Your input would be greatly<br>appreciated!!<br></p><p>Brian Gesiak<br>​<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160403/fafbaebe/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/969b04d28c02f951ccc03f615b9a92b3?s=50"></div><header><strong>[SR-710][RFC] Automatically detecting XCTest test methods on Linux: Reflection?

However, the<br>corelibs-xctest README spells out the following goal for the project: &quot;This<br>version of XCTest uses the same API as the XCTest you are familiar with<br>from Xcode. Our goal is to enable your project&#39;s tests to run on all Swift<br>platforms without having to rewrite them.&quot;<br></p><p>This goal often conflicts with what would be the best API for a Swift<br>testing framework--we are forced to use mutable reference types, extensive<br>subclassing, include a ton of optional properties--all in order to mirror<br>exactly the Apple XCTest API.<br></p><p>I suppose we *could* modify the SDK overlay for XCTest to provide an API<br>more suitable for Swift, but I think that would involve a lot of<br>coordination with Apple XCTest and Xcode teams, some swift-evolution<br>proposals, and a potentially harsh migration path for developers writing<br>their tests in Apple XCTest. So while I think corelibs-xctest and Apple<br>XCTest can (and should) evolve to better take advantage of Swift features<br>over time, I don&#39;t think we can migrate both before Swift 3&#39;s release.<br></p><p>(+CC Mike Ferris, who works on Apple XCTest and corelibs-xctest.)<br></p><p>- Brian Gesiak<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160403/eb32fc4a/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/969b04d28c02f951ccc03f615b9a92b3?s=50"></div><header><strong>[SR-710][RFC] Automatically detecting XCTest test methods on Linux: Reflection?

SourceKit?</strong> from <string>Daniel Dunbar</string> &lt;daniel_dunbar at apple.com&gt;<p>May  6, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Sorry for the delay in following up.<br></p><p>I have had several long discussions on this topic with Dmitri and others, which<br>I will try to summarize here:<br></p><p>*TL;DR*: We think the right long-term path forward is to pursue porting<br>SourceKit to Linux, and would like to explore that direction first before trying<br>to develop a compromise which either (a) uses internal and likely-to-break APIs<br>(e.g., dump-ast) or (b) devotes significant engineering resources to a &quot;right<br>solution&quot; for this problem, but which will only solve this problem and not other<br>issues where having an API for use with the Swift language.<br></p><p>## Problem Statement<br></p><p>The XCTest API has historically been defined in terms of methods with a<br>particular naming convention `test...` which were in subclasses of XCTestCase.<br></p><p>On OS X, these methods can be found via the Objective-C runtime but that does<br>not work on Linux. Our current solution on Linux requires manual specification<br>of all of the test methods, and is a huge maintenance burden for people trying<br>to use XCTest on Linux or maintain cross-platform projects.<br></p><p>## Background<br></p><p>This feature works on OS X in two ways:<br></p><p>1. As mentioned, tests are run by dynamic discovery through the Objective-C<br>   runtime when the bundle containing the tests is executed.<br>   <br>2. Within the Xcode IDE, tests are &quot;discovered&quot; (for use in UI) through the use<br>   of the Xcode indexer.<br>   <br>   The mechanism at work here, for Swift, is a combination of functionality in<br>   the indexing engine (to aggregate and query results) and the raw underlying<br>   data provided by SourceKit.<br>   <br>   We would like any implementation of this feature to share as much code as<br>   possible with SourceKit and Xcode&#39;s implementation in order for<br>   cross-platform projects to behave predictably.<br>   <br>It also happens that SwiftPM has several other needs for API-based interactions<br>with the functionality in the Swift compiler. Several examples:<br>   <br>* We would like to be able to enforce the strictness of the `Package.swift`<br>  manifest file format. This requires APIs to interact with the Swift<br>  AST. https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1433<br>  <br>* We would like to support advanced features for dealing with automatic<br>  inter-module dependencies. For example, one idea which has been proposed is<br>  that if a module attempted to import a module upon which it did not have a<br>  dependency, that we would prompt the developer if this dependency should<br>  automatically be added to the manifest. Doing this feature well requires<br>  APIs to interact with the Swift compiler as it parses source code and<br>  reports diagnostics.<br>  <br>* We would like to understand the current level of parallelism being used by<br>  the Swift compiler, so that llbuild can accurately schedule work. This<br>  requires APIs for interacting with an in-flight compilation process.<br></p><p>## Discussion<br></p><p>We discussed several avenues of attack on this problem. I will go through them<br>one by one. I am just attempting to summarize the conversation, obviously there<br>is a ton of nuance to each point, and hopefully other people will chime in if I<br>missed something important.<br></p><p>### Language Features<br></p><p>One way to view this problem is that XCTest&#39;s API (i.e., depending on test<br>naming and dynamic discovery) is a poor fit for Swift today, and that this<br>problem should be tackled in that direction.<br></p><p>For example, the Swift compiler itself has a test framework that does not depend<br>on dynamic discovery. One could also imagine language-level features which would<br>solve the arbitrary problem of wanting to find discoverable things; that could<br>take the form of an `@XCTest` attribute, or &quot;generalized attribute&quot; support.<br></p><p>The current mission for Swift 3, however, is API parity between Linux and OS X,<br>and so this direction does not lead to any short term solution. For that reason,<br>while many of us ultimately think this is the right long term direction, we need<br>to find another one as well.<br></p><p>### Custom &quot;Supported&quot; XCTest Feature<br></p><p>The next option is to pursue a custom, but &quot;supported&quot; feature intended to<br>tackle this problem head on. Some proposals that have come up are, e.g., a new<br>compiler flag which emits the list of test methods.<br></p><p>This approach has a couple unfortunate properties:<br></p><p>1. It is non-trivial. We can either design this as an incredibly XCTest specific<br>   feature requiring understanding of the backend (compiler directly emits<br>   metadata into .o file), or a midway feature (compiler tells us list of test<br>   methods, but then we have to manage incremental compilation and the desire to<br>   not compile things multiple times more than necessary ourselves).<br>   <br>2. It is not-reusable. The work we do here doesn&#39;t help with any of the other<br>   ways we want to use the Swift compiler as an API.<br>   <br>### Implement an API-based Interface<br></p><p>This approach means porting SourceKit to Linux, and then building this feature<br>on top of that (that itself will be non-trivial, which is something not to be<br>glossed over).<br></p><p>Everyone generally agrees we should have some kind of API-based access to the<br>compiler, so this is in line with our long-term direction, but in a way which is<br>actionable now (it does not require design).<br></p><p>This approach has its own issues:<br></p><p>1. Porting SourceKit may require a fair amount of work. The current code base is<br>   very OS X specific in particular areas (generally around the use of<br>   `libxpc`). This will require adding abstractions, developing alternatives,<br>   and writing the code and build system changes to get this to happen.<br>   <br>2. Somehwat unrelated, but the compiler itself (`swiftc`) is not yet written in<br>   a way that it can be used from SourceKit. If we do port and use SourceKit, it<br>   will mean the toolchains increase in size because we effectively will have<br>   two copies of many parts of Swift/Clang/LLVM installed.<br>   <br>3. By itself, this does not fully solve the issue. As mentioned in the<br>   background, SourceKit itself does not directly manage all parts of XCTest<br>   discovery today on OS X, it is a collaboration between SourceKit and the<br>   Xcode indexer to do discovery without execution. The expectation, however, is<br>   that we can, however, use SourceKit&#39;s APIs to implement this feature in a way<br>   that is &quot;supported&quot;.<br></p><p>## Conclusion<br></p><p>The conclusion was that after weighing all of the tradeoffs, it made the most<br>sense to encourage porting of SourceKit to Linux and then using it to build out<br>the Linux test discovery feature. This was most in line with a desirable<br>long-term direction without being blocked on language design.<br></p><p>I don&#39;t think we are particularly firm in this conclusion. If you feel that the work<br>you have already invested gets us so close that it is worth prioritizing that<br>approach, then please push back.<br></p><p> - Daniel<br></p><p>&gt; On May 1, 2016, at 8:19 PM, Brian Gesiak &lt;modocache at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I made an attempt at adding `swiftc -frontend -dump-xctest-methods`: https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2364 &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2364&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Feedback appreciated!!<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - Brian Gesiak<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Sun, Apr 24, 2016 at 8:59 PM, Brian Gesiak &lt;modocache at gmail.com &lt;mailto:modocache at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; Thanks to this commit &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/ad269b0e1fbc12037ae2c16634b5b451061657c6&gt; it looks as if IsTestCandidate has been moved out of SourceKit and into libIndex:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; isTestCandidate(swift::ValueDecl) &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/8dad7f780347788f6032ad9e25ce5340aecf4073/lib/Index/Index.cpp#L754&gt;<br>&gt; swift::index::FuncDeclIndexSymbol.IsTestCandidate &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/41e4e9b6efc745f04df23bd6a803a467c57a66b8/include/swift/Index/IndexSymbol.h#L102&gt; and where it’s set &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/8dad7f780347788f6032ad9e25ce5340aecf4073/lib/Index/Index.cpp#L786&gt;.<br>&gt; I’m looking into adding an option to swiftc to emit XCTest candidate methods.
