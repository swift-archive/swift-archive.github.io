I have no trouble reading `XMLRPC` as a single six-letter acronym and mapping it to the XML-RPC technology, the &quot;ack&quot; in `LAPBACK` is an abbreviation and ought to be mixed-case, and `XSLTiBook` is self-inflicted—it&#39;s not ambiguous unless you insist on violating your own API guidelines to preserve your own nonstandard capitalization.)<br></p><p>I think it’s important to remember that at some point acronyms are simply the enemy and that before using one in any name you should think about whether you need it. For example, in HTMLDocument it makes some sense as HTML is significantly shorter and very widely understood; you could use say, HypertextDocument since it’s not *much* longer, but it’d then actually be less specific.<br></p><p>AWS S3 RPC URL is a pretty extreme example, good for highlighting the problems certainly, but right off I’d say that you don’t need either AWS or RPC; the protocol is often just referred to as S3, and the RPC I believe is redundant as I’m pretty sure the S3 API isn’t used any other way. The AWS is definitely redundant if you specify URL, as URL implies the ability to specify any S3 compatible host.<br></p><p>So if you boil it down it could be simplified to S3URL, which isn’t pretty, but isn’t that bad any either, or you could switch for something like S3Address, and use url as a parameter name to clarify that that’s how you’re describing the address.<br></p><p>I know you want to use it as the extreme example that the standard will need to be able to handle, but I think that the first rule of acronyms should be that if you have more than one in a name then you’re doing it wrong. Even having a single acronym in a name should require you to stop and think whether you really need it, as in many cases you may not, or it may make more sense to move it into a parameter name.<br></p><p>It’s definitely a tricky one to put into a formal specification though, as it can be very subjective, and there will always be edge cases where something doesn’t quite work, but I’m not sure we should worry too much about multiple conjoined acronyms, as they should be shunned for the evil monstrosities that they are =D<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9bfba345bd373f7b8874d58fed6372ff?s=50"></div><header><strong>Analysis of case conventions for initialisms</strong> from <string>David Waite</string> &lt;david at alkaline-solutions.com&gt;<p>February 12, 2016 at 08:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>Just to make things more complex, I’d like to point out I’ve used yet another style myself in the past, #2 with elements of #1 which I’ll refer to as #4 for the purposes of this mail. (2 &lt;&lt; 1). Note that I have bad grammar, thus I may mess up initialism vs acronym vs abbreviation. Feel free to correct me.<br></p><p>If you are using two letter acronyms, leave the entire initialism consistently capitalized (#1 behavior). E.g. <br></p><p>	func tee(ioInput: IOOutputStream) -&gt; (IOOutputStream, IOOutputStream)<br></p><p>If you are using three or more letter initialism, treat them as words for capitalization. (#2 behavior) E.g.<br></p><p>	func htmlDigest(for html: String) -&gt; HtmlDigest<br></p><p>Visually, I find if an abbreviation is two characters long, mixed case interferes with my ability to read it. Although the overloading is a bit coincidental in this case, the system is not about Io the moon, but IO the Input/Output concept.<br></p><p>Two letter abbreviations are short enough that at least I can easily backtrack to say “they are not talking about some IOO concept”. The more capital letters put in a sequence, the more you lose the ability to disambiguate.<br></p><p>I’ve also found that it is very hard to turn a two letter initialism into an acronym. In general, the pronounceable two letter abbreviations are too short to be unambiguous when written, thus being poor choices for naming in general. However, if we expect people to write code on mobile phones going forward, then this may change (we may be in trouble in general).<br></p><p>You also have few enough two letter initialisms that this does not in practice run into the problems where the name of the thing is described by multiple concatenated abbreviations, such as an HTML DOM. Such cases of multiple two-letter abbreviations are rare enough that there does not need to be consistency rules for them IMHO (or shall I say, Imho)<br></p><p>I’ve found in practice that three letter initialisms have pros and cons to being treated by each set of rule - but there are enough TLA initialisms (TlaInitialism) that concatenation is more likely are likely - and it is better to just treat the few two-letter initialisms as special cases, and have everything else play by rule #2.<br></p><p>Finally, this has an interesting side benefit when you consider most objective C packages have an initialism, abbreviation or mnemonic of the module as a two-character prefix (even third parties often prefer this over the recommended three-character prefix). Assuming that is preserved on import of non-Foundation libraries, this will make such code look far more consistent.<br></p><p>-DW<br></p><p>&gt; On Feb 11, 2016, at 10:51 PM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I just posted a write-up about various case conventions for initialisms:<br>&gt; https://gist.github.com/dabrahams/55fc5ece355da4664730.

Any “rule” considered here should be able to stand on it’s own logical merits, no matter what other languages may do. <br>	#1: Interesting and acceptable. I find the type vs. variable name argument somewhat weak, since it’s almost always clear by usage what it is. However, the consistent upper or lower casing still relays the fact that a word is an acronym or initialism fairly clearly, though not as strongly as #3.<br>	#2: Unacceptable, as it completely ruins any notion of the words being an acronym or initialism. In normal writing, initialisms are easy to see, and are read by saying each letter separately. To me, this fact completely outweighs the argument for clearer word boundaries, since the letters, read separately, are the words of an acronym or initialism. So XMLRPCConnection is read as “ex em el ar pee cee connection (excuse the incorrect phonetics), and writing it as XmlRpcConnection just confuses the user at first glance about whether the words are words or a’s/i’s, especially if the a/i is somewhat uncommon.<br>	#3: This is largely my personal style, though I sometimes uppercase initialisms/acronyms used as variable names as well. This style makes usage almost entirely consistent across the language, and largely consistent with normal usage. There’s still the question of variable names, but that’s rather minor, and can be improved with better variable names, as already mentioned.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Jon Shier<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4fe988326eed161b989d0c5521cb105?s=50"></div><header><strong>Analysis of case conventions for initialisms</strong> from <string>Jordan Rose</string> &lt;jordan_rose at apple.com&gt;<p>February 12, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Addendum: another problem with convention #2 is that the rule produces &quot;Mccall&quot;, &quot;Iphone&quot;, and &quot;Latex&quot; along with &quot;Html&quot;, all of which are less readable (for me, in context of a larger identifier like &quot;IphoneViewController&quot;) than the convention #1 output.<br></p><p>(At least, my understanding of the convention #2 rule.)<br></p><p><br>&gt; On Feb 12, 2016, at 11:12, Jordan Rose via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; (re: https://gist.github.com/dabrahams/55fc5ece355da4664730 &lt;https://gist.github.com/dabrahams/55fc5ece355da4664730&gt;)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I am very strongly in favor of convention #1, and it comes from what we were talking about offline yesterday.
