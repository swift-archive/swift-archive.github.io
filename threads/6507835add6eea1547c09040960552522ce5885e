Most of the examples in the Swift Language guide for the switch statement could more simply be written with a switch expression. Also, I think just replacing it with an if may not be considered a big enough benefit to make a change. I am pretty sure we could accommodate switch with something like your proposal too, if there is strong agreement that this is a better way to go.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; What do you think?<br></p><p>• Some downsides, we lose terseness which Chris and others brought up as important if trying to come up with something better. <br> • This is similar to python’s ternary while it reads pretty well as an English sentence, I am not sure it is better. Grouping the outcomes together I think is better. It feels odd and I remember when Python first introduced it, it was confusing. <br></p><p>Thanks <br>- Paul<br>&gt; <br>&gt; — Sasha<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
