Similar tests already exist in the standard library: the elementsEqual methods in Sequence for instance; the methods can indicate two sequences are different but not where they diverged. Flipping it around, it means that sequence equivalence, and several other sequence methods, can be expressed in terms of mismatch-finding. However, returning the divergence point means returning references to the diverging elements, which means an index, which means that collections are required instead of plain sequences.<br></p><p> &lt;https://gist.github.com/CTMacUser/c1a0d7ac60cf827184c33e8768a23dfc#proposed-solution&gt;Proposed solution<br></p><p>The Swift standard library should provide generic implementations of the &quot;mismatch&quot; algorithm for forward searches on prefixes and backward searches on suffixes. The forward/prefix form is called diverges(from: isEquivalent:). The backward/suffix form is called converges(with: isEquivalent:), and is present only when the collection type supports bidirectional indexing. If the collection&#39;s element type conforms to Equatable, there variants of the method(s) that drop the second argument and instead use == for the equivalency test.<br></p><p> &lt;https://gist.github.com/CTMacUser/c1a0d7ac60cf827184c33e8768a23dfc#detailed-design&gt;Detailed design<br></p><p> &lt;https://gist.github.com/CTMacUser/c1a0d7ac60cf827184c33e8768a23dfc#divergesfromisequivalent-and-divergesfrom&gt;diverges(from:isEquivalent:) and diverges(from:)<br></p><p>Forward mismatching on prefixes will be added to the Collection protocol requirements with a default implementation.

I tried making<br>&gt; sample implementations and a proposal, but it transitioned to adapting<br>&gt; C++’s “is_permutation,” “next_permutation,” and “prev_permutation”<br>&gt; instead.  The sample implementation of “is_permutation” I saw at &lt;<br>&gt; http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/is_permutation&gt; involves the<br>&gt; “mismatch” function, which we also don’t seem to have.  Since that function<br>&gt; seems like a small enough bite the chew, I finally made a proposal at &lt;<br>&gt; https://gist.github.com/CTMacUser/c1a0d7ac60cf827184c33e8768a23dfc&gt;.<br>&gt;  (The Gist is currently flagged as secret.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Oh, it seems that everyone here has moved on to Swift 3, and so has my<br>&gt; third-party documentation program.  Unfortunately, I still on non-beta<br>&gt; code, which means Swift 2.2.  So I took some time having to translate<br>&gt; concepts between the versions, including new names.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The name “mismatch” didn’t seem Swift-y enough since it doesn’t describe<br>&gt; what’s happening from a Swift programming perspective.  I tried:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; * commonPrefixUntil / commonSuffixUntil<br>&gt; * elementsEqualUntil / elementsEqualSince<br>&gt; * elementsShared(until:) / elementsShared(since:)<br>&gt; * elementsDiverge / elementsConverge<br>&gt;<br>&gt; No, those parameters on the third one don’t make sense.  The last one<br>&gt; inspired me to trim the fat and just use “diverge(from:)”.  Since we use<br>&gt; indexes here like C++’s iterators, that was the best choice for a return<br>&gt; type that allows the users to take the results in an inspecting manner or<br>&gt; mutating manner.  But Swift’s model doesn’t handle reversed collections<br>&gt; like C++ does, so I need a separate routine for mismatching with reverse<br>&gt; iterators, i.e. searching backwards with indexes.  Since I used the<br>&gt; “diverge” name for the forward search, I flipped it to “converge(with:)”<br>&gt; for the reverse/suffix search.  The returns aren’t used in quite the same<br>&gt; manner since I have to avoid needing a before-the-start index.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A lot of the format was badly copied from the rotate/reverse proposal (&lt;<br>&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0078-rotate-algorithm.md&gt;).<br>&gt; Looking for opinions, mistakes/clean-up, anything major missing?...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; —<br>&gt; Daryle Walker<br>&gt; Mac, Internet, and Video Game Junkie<br>&gt; darylew AT mac DOT com<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160707/538801d8/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
