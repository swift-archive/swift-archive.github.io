All the others are relatively<br>&gt;&gt; cheap transformations on pointer values, and get used a lot for<br>&gt;&gt; typecasting. An allocating constructor would be less locatable among<br>&gt;&gt; such uses of typecasting-via-constructor. The memory-allocating<br>&gt;&gt; static method has the merit of sticking out, and pairs nicely with<br>&gt;&gt; the necessary deallocation call, like the malloc/free pair.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This all probably deserves a separate discussion from the overall<br>&gt; umbrella proposal. Another thing to consider here is whether the logic<br>&gt; to allocate an array of values really belongs on<br>&gt; UnsafeMutablePointer—it seems like a better fit for<br>&gt; UnsafeMutableBufferPointer, whose whole job is to reference an array<br>&gt; of objects in memory. <br>&gt;<br>&gt; Currently, you need to allocate the memory using<br>&gt; UnsafeMutablePointer.alloc, then immediately wrap it in a<br>&gt; BufferPointer with the same count, which is a bit awkward.<br></p><p>You make a good point, Joe.  Why would we throw out the size<br>information immediately after allocating the memory?<br></p><p>*On the other hand*, UnsafeMutableBufferPointer is really not designed<br>to support allocated-but-initialized memory, and I think I&#39;d prefer to<br>keep it that way.  I don&#39;t think once you step into unsafe-land, you<br>should have to live more dangerously than the individual situation<br>requires, and modifying part of an array without ARC overhead is an<br>important use-case.<br></p><p>For buffers with some uninitialized elements we have ManagedBuffer et<br>al., but of course that doesn&#39;t cover the use-case of manual memory<br>deallocation.  So maybe a different component altogether—or some kind of<br>more-general unification of these components—is what we need in the long<br>run.  Definitely more appropriate to pursue this in another thread.<br></p><p>&gt;<br>&gt; -Joe<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b660eecceda60138f137d353b8289925?s=50"></div><header><strong>Evolving UnsafeMutablePointer.alloc (was Re: [Review] SE-0006 Apply API Guidelines to the Standard Library)</strong> from <string>Janosch Hildebrand</string> &lt;jnosh at jnosh.com&gt;<p>February  1, 2016 at 01:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>Speaking of memory allocation, another improvement I would like is to allow allocation of **at least** `capacity` elements where the actual capacity of the buffer is part of the return value(s).<br></p><p>Given that dynamic allocators generally work with a fixed set of block sizes (buckets, pages, ...) it seems to make sense to expose this. ManagedBuffer already works this way.<br></p><p>For example you can use `malloc_good_size()` on Darwin to implement this. With the current static function on `UnsafeMutablePointer` you can simply return a tuple with the Pointer and actual capacity but an initializer directly precludes this. OTOH `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer` could support this even more elegantly and a hypothetical future component could probably also easily support this.<br></p><p><br>- Janosch<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
