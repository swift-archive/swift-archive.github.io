It’s not a very outlandish thing. We already have min/max. Adding a function for the mean would probably be too much. Collection is a bit of a special API; it should be reasonably comprehensive to allow developers to keep working at the most abstract level possible, but you’re right, of course, that there must be limits.<br></p><p>2. Many complex collections will probably decide to cache their min/max indexes and invalidate them on insertion/removal. With this API, we could grab those indexes from a stored property; without it, we’d have to get the min/max elements (which internally will probably just look up those cached indexes) and work backwards to find the indexes. I’d rather remove min() and max() and replace them with collection[collection.indexOfMaxElement].<br></p><p>As far as naming goes, you’re right. “minIndex&quot; and “maxIndex&quot; are far too similar to “startIndex&quot; and “endIndex”.<br></p><p>Karl<br></p><p>&gt; on Sat Apr 16 2016, Nate Cook&lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Hello all,<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Attached is a draft of a proposal to expand the min and max sequence APIs to<br>&gt; &gt; better handle collections and to support future sorted sequences/collections.<br>&gt; &gt; The proposal is in a gist here and inlined below—would love to hear any comments<br>&gt; &gt; or feedback before submitting the proposal.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Nate<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Proposal: Expanded min/max algorithms<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; This proposal would expand on the min() and max() sequence methods to add<br>&gt; &gt; methods that return the corresponding index for a collection, efficiently find<br>&gt; &gt; the minimum and maximum elements or indices at the same time, and provide<br>&gt; &gt; extension points for sorted collections to provide all these results more<br>&gt; &gt; efficiently.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Related Bugs: SR-889 and SR-890<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Motivation<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; The Sequence protocol currently offers min() and max() methods that return the<br>&gt; &gt; minimum and maximum elements of a sequence or collection. Unfortunately, there<br>&gt; &gt; are applications where these methods do not provide enough flexibility to be<br>&gt; &gt; useful.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; First, if the user of a collection wants not just to get the minimum value but<br>&gt; &gt; also to operate on it in some way (e.g., mutation or just accessing it multiple<br>&gt; &gt; times), she would need the index of the minimum element. The current APIs don&#39;t<br>&gt; &gt; support that, so she would need to write her own.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Second, the writer of a sorted collection is currently unable to provide<br>&gt; &gt; efficient responses to the min() and max() methods when used in a generic<br>&gt; &gt; context, even though these should be O(1) operations. Just like Set can respond<br>&gt; &gt; quickly to contains(_:) even in a generic context, so too should new sorted<br>&gt; &gt; collections be able to optimize their responses.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Finally, getting the minimum and maximum elements (or indices) of a collection<br>&gt; &gt; or sequence currently requires calling both min() and max(). With two calls,<br>&gt; &gt; every element is iterated and compared twice. When you need both results,<br>&gt; &gt; finding both the minimum and the maximum at the same time is more efficient,<br>&gt; &gt; requiring only a single pass and 25% fewer comparisons.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Proposed solution<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; This proposal has three parts:<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; 1 Adding minIndex() and maxIndex() methods to Collection that return the index<br>&gt; &gt; of the minimum and maximum elements, respectively.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; let numbers = [30, 40, 10, 20, 60, 50]<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; if let i = numbers.minIndex() {<br>&gt; &gt; print(&quot;\(i): \(numbers[i])&quot;) // 2: 10<br>&gt; &gt; }<br>&gt; Just with regard to naming, I don&#39;t think these work. I read “minIndex”<br>&gt; as “the minimum index,” and since we expect all indices to be<br>&gt; comparable, that clearly implies c.minIndex() == c.startIndex. I think<br>&gt; you&#39;d need “c.indexOfMin()”<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I am also really reluctant to add specialized algorithms for things<br>&gt; that can be trivially composed out of existing parts, e.g.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; c.indices.min { c[$0]&lt;c[$1] }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Once we start down this road, we very quickly end up with mapValues,<br>&gt; mapKeys, indexOfMinimumKey, etc.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; --<br>&gt; Dave<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
