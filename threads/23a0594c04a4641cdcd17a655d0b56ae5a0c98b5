I<br>think it is the best programming language we have today and I really enjoy<br>coding in Swift (it was love at first sight).

I’m<br>programming in Swift since the day-zero of the first public beta release<br>and since this I try to convince the teams I work to adopt Swift too. When<br>they ask me about Swift 3 and future versions, now I have something to<br>say. Nevertheless they ask: “After the next conversion process will we need<br>to rewrite important parts of the code and test them one more time spending<br>weeks with this again like we did with previous versions?” And I have to<br>answer: “Yes. But only we want access to latest Swift, Apple SDK and  and<br>third-party framework features.&quot; Of course we want!<br></p><p>I know that resilience is a goal of your team and it is not a easy thing to<br>accomplish. But the example of `async` and `await` is a feature that me and<br>others are asking since pre-RC 1.0 versions. I think that @Craig suggestion<br>is a very good one. Some things have, I think, to have its discussion<br>started very early in the process to guide the long term development.
