My application is designed to consume arbitrary swift 2.2 code. If there is a problem with swift 3 then I suppose it can be fixed, but if swift 3 has no issues then it looks like I have few options for remediation.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; On 03/22/2016 12:56 PM, Dmitri Gribenko wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Tue, Mar 22, 2016 at 12:17 PM, Rafkind, Jon via swift-dev<br>&gt; &lt;swift-dev at swift.org&gt;&lt;mailto:swift-dev at swift.org&gt;wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I have to support swift 2.2 for the time being because I have to support the current release of xcode.

This way you will get a<br>&gt; preview of the changes, would be able to provide feedback, and maybe<br>&gt; even find issues with the changes that we are making before Swift 3 is<br>&gt; finalized in a release.
