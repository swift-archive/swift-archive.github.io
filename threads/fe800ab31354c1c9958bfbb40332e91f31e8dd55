Our goal is to allow app developers to combine a mix of Swift modules (e.g., SwiftPM packages), where each module is known to compile with a specific version of the language (module A works with Swift 3, module B works with Swift 3.1, etc.), then combine those modules into a single binary. The key feature is that a module can be migrated from Swift 3 to 3.1 to 4 (and beyond) independently of its dependencies.<br></p><p>This sounds like a reasonable solution...<br>If I understand you correctly;<br>   The compiler(s)  would be able to compile sources from 3.0 and future versions?<br></p><p>well, that solves most source breaking issues, <br></p><p>It then has however the disadvantage that one cannot<br>combine older  language elements from <br>e.g. version 3.0  and 4.0 or higher together in a single source file? <br>However, if so, I can live with that.<br></p><p>Does this method have further compatibility issues that at the moment don’t cross my mind?<br></p><p>Unfortunately that doesn’t go back to 2.2, unfortunately<br>because in 3.0 the classical for ; ; loop will be deactivated.<br></p><p>I regard this as a serious mistake and <br>have no doubt this removal is disturbing many <br>experienced and more pragmatical programmers.<br></p><p>It made my alarm bells ringing and it was the main <br>reason I have climbed in to Swift-Evolution<br>to discuss this.<br></p><p>      -= Maybe it’s not too late =- <br>For the moment the classical for ;;  could simply <br>remain activated  (Yes)  in 3.0. because:  <br>  <br>  - It doesn’t conflict at all with all other language elements,<br></p><p>  - most important: there are still no good alternative for iterations like these  <br>       for var x:Float = -60;    x &lt; 60;    x += w * 1.2<br>       {<br>           for var y: Float = 130;    y &gt; 60;    y -= backtrack<br>          // etc.<br>          // especially for iterations using Floating point numbers!<br></p><p>         for these, one has to fall back on tedious do-while constructs.<br></p><p>  - There are more sane reasons, but a few months ago<br>     I have written extensively about this subject.<br></p><p>So, yes, obviously my recommendation is <br></p><p>Please don’t remove the for ;; from 3.0<br> <br>and replace the current compile cry:<br>    “C-style for statement is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Swift”<br></p><p>which I currently perceive like this:<br></p><p>   “ The for ;; statement, although being used successfully in many other languages<br>      is in conflict with the attitude and believe of some of us with a lot of theoretical experience.<br>     Therefore it will be removed in a future version of Swift. <br>     Please resort to using the do-while statement instead.”<br></p><p>the new compiler warning could be then:<br>  “Warning! This for ;; statement should only be used by highly  skilled <br>   programmers with a more pragmatical attitude.<br>   Use at your own risk, like with any other Swift statement.” <br></p><p>Just leave it in.  (but I guess it could be to late) <br></p><p>If it is really removed in 3.0, then I promise I will write<br>an official  proposal to bring it back in 3.x and further.<br>some help with that is appreciated.<br></p><p><br>Kind Regards<br></p><p>Yet another Ted :o) <br></p><p>www.tedvg.com <br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>&gt; Date: Wed, 27 Jul 2016 12:38:51 -0700<br>&gt; From: Ted Kremenek &lt;kremenek at apple.com &lt;mailto:kremenek at apple.com&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; To: swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;, swift-evolution-announce at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution-announce at swift.org&gt;,<br>&gt; 	swift-dev &lt;swift-dev at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-dev at swift.org&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; Subject: [swift-evolution] End of source-breaking changes for Swift 3<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Dear friends,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Today is July 27 — and the last planned day to take source-breaking changes for Swift 3.

At least, it was my impression<br>that it was no longer in beta stage and that it was OK to use Swift for<br>production, no one told otherwise, if I remember correctly.<br></p><p>And so I embraced Swift immediately, me being mostly an early adapter <br>  (even when being in IT since 1978 or so, or maybe rather because of that!) <br> assuming that it was solid and a safe bet to use it in a production environment. <br></p><p>However, IMHO, it has been virtually in a beta stage until now, <br>simply because, things were and are still changing!.<br>Yes, of course I do expect improvements, however they should be<br>additive, not code breaking changes.<br></p><p>I also do understand and don’t underestimate the motion with new languages. <br></p><p><br>If I had known all this before, I would have remained programming<br>my apps in Objective C until a more solid version came along. <br>In the mean time, yes, of course, I would have played with it and studying it<br>sideways, and take part and listening in this forum. <br></p><p>And, maybe then I would have enough faith in 3.0 that is to <br>use Swift 3.0 and higher fully in a production environment.<br>And don’t get me wrong, I like Swift very much it really <br>is a very advanced development.<br></p><p>And then another thing, well, maybe you’d<br>think that I am whining a bit, but try to see it this way:<br>Most things in Swift are OK and even superb, so I don’t<br>need to write about these! What remains then is just to <br>write about the thing’s I don’t like or which could be<br>improved.

Well, then maybe you also could perhaps have made more effort<br>to keep the for;;  and other colleagues too that think likewise? <br>Or in the near future, to support my upcoming proposal? <br></p><p>&gt; and there are a number of other proposals whose outcomes are not ones I would have personally preferred.<br>Of course, I realize that as well, that goes for me too. <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S94ohyErSw<br>:o)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; However,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1. There is a well-defined process through which all changes to the Swift language must go, laid out in the swift-evolution repository&#39;s documentation from the first day Swift became an open-source project.<br>I know that, and that’s why I will make a proposal after 3.0 to reinstate the classical for loop. <br></p><p>&gt; 2. That process includes feedback and review from both the community and the Swift core engineers, and often multiple rounds of discussion.<br>Agreed, but I arrived much later..<br></p><p>&gt; 3. The process doesn&#39;t work if we disregard its outcomes simply because we don&#39;t like them, or if we allow interminable chains of back-and-forth proposals because people on one side of issue X simply cannot accept a particular decision.<br>Obviously, however, if a proposal, due to later insights, is wrong or conflicting is should be discussable to drop, correct or replace it.<br> <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The technical aspects of the C-style for loop and its proposed replacements have already been discussed ad nauseam on this list and in other places, so I won&#39;t touch on them.<br>true, I’ve had my share in these too. what remains now for me to do is, <br> to propose a reinstatement of the for ;; (as in Go)  after 3.0<br>I’ll do that. <br></p><p>Met vriendelijke groeten<br>from a Dutch professional somehow landed in Germany :o)<br>TedvG<br>www.tedvg.com &lt;http://www.tedvg.com/&gt;<br>www.ravelnotes.com &lt;http://www.ravelnotes.com/&gt;<br>www.speyer.de &lt;http://www.speyer.de/&gt;<br></p><p><br>&gt; <br>&gt; Best regards,<br>&gt; Austin  <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;   <br>&gt;&gt;   - It doesn’t conflict at all with all other language elements,<br>YEs!<br>&gt; <br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160728/f42d8b03/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/279fa63eae4ac804b4dbdb83686797bf?s=50"></div><header><strong>End of source-breaking changes for Swift 3</strong> from <string>Austin Zheng</string> &lt;austinzheng at gmail.com&gt;<p>July 28, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Thu, Jul 28, 2016 at 2:37 PM, Ted F.A. van Gaalen &lt;tedvgiosdev at gmail.com&gt;<br>wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Hi Austin, thank you, please see inline<br>&gt; ?<br>&gt; I have explained this many times before, didn’t I?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Its removal causes a very crucial limitation/change in the way<br>&gt; one writes programs, So writing about this for;; subject is<br>&gt; very, very different from long discussions like those about<br>&gt; allowing a comma at the end of a list or not…<br>&gt; because removing the for;; has a very heavy impact.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Furthermore, IMHO the decision to remove the for;; was based<br>&gt; on very subjective loose and partly irrelevant criteria.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>I don&#39;t care how good your reasons are, the fact of the matter is that it<br>was extensively discussed, a decision was made, and it is now a done deal.<br>Please remember that these are high-traffic lists that many people<br>subscribe to; complaining about the C for loop is a waste of everybody&#39;s<br>time.
