I wouldn&#39;t use arcane patches either for a custom kernel.<br></p><p>However, I recently had to make a very tiny change to a repo, one line of code and it felt wrong to loose the ability to draw from the original upstream because of it.<br></p><p>It was after all, such a minor change that could have been applied after each upstream pull. I know, this could lead to merging conflicts if you support arbitrary versions (x.x +), however, merging your forked repo would lead to the same thing, but remotely (another thing to worry about)<br></p><p>To be honest, I&#39;m not convinced either this would be the best course of action, but it does build upon git, and it does help in certain situations.
