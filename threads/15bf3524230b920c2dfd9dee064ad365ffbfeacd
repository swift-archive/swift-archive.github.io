Also I believe this goes against the spirit of Protocol Oriented Programming that Swift is trying to push.<br></p><p>&gt; What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -1. The examples are not compelling enough. The only value currently, that I see at least, is the ability to require a specific storage mechanism for properties and to provide default values for all implementations of those properties.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Maybe, but I believe updates to protocols are the better path.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; No.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Yes, such as C++ and C#. In the vast majority of cases, the usage seemed to break down into two basic categories: mixins and interfaces. I don&#39;t believe this proposal really addresses either of those use cases well.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; How much effort did you put into your review?
