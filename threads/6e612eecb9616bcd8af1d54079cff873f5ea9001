The syntax is wonderfully natural, and the features it provides are surprisingly useful given their simplicity.  Because Swift forbids the redeclaration of names between structs, enums, classes, and typealiases, I don’t believe that the existing qualified import syntax is needed.  Therefore, I propose the introduction of 3 agda-esque operations for imports to replace the usual `import {func|typealias|struct|class|enum|etc.}` syntax:<br></p><p>	• import Foo using (bar, Baz, qux, corge, …)<br>	• import Foo hiding (bar, baz, qux, corge, …)<br>	• import Foo renaming (grault to garply, waldo to fred, …)<br></p><p>The first of these is used to introduce a limited set of identifiers into scope, the second to import all but the given identifiers, and the third to rename identifiers at the module level.  Again, it should be obvious by uniqueness of identifiers what each one is referencing, so qualification of each identifier is unnecessary.  If more context is needed, or more granularity, a Haskell-esque <br></p><p>import Foo {using|hiding|renaming} (Baz(..) [to Graft(..)])<br></p><p>could be in order for structs, classes, and enums, but I don’t anticipate it will be of much use because individual members are already qualified by their containing structure or instance variable anyway. <br></p><p>What do you think?<br></p><p>~Robert Widmann<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0a5152b275c43b493a94b5a6a868905?s=50"></div><header><strong>Beef up Imports</strong> from <string>Pyry Jahkola</string> &lt;pyry.jahkola at iki.fi&gt;<p>December 27, 2015 at 03:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On 27 Dec 2015, at 07:12, Developer via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Therefore, I propose the introduction of 3 agda-esque operations for imports to replace the usual `import {func|typealias|struct|class|enum|etc.}` syntax:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	• import Foo using (bar, Baz, qux, corge, …)<br>&gt; 	• import Foo hiding (bar, baz, qux, corge, …)<br>&gt; 	• import Foo renaming (grault to garply, waldo to fred, …)<br></p><p>+1, but why not just…?<br></p><p>import Foo using (bar, Baz, qux, waldo as fred)  // a &quot;whitelist import&quot;<br>import Foo hiding (bar, Baz, qux, waldo as fred) // a &quot;blacklist import&quot;<br></p><p>I&#39;ve been able to work around identifier conflicts with the present import syntax but it gets clumsy with larger modules.

One more reason not to rename imported identifiers is that it makes them less googleable at call site; there&#39;s an extra human indirection (looking up the respective import statement) before being successfully at searching with the commonly known name.<br></p><p>But is there more we could prune away from this proposal? When would you really want to hide or selectively choose any qualified imports? If qualified imports always imported all identifiers, with the restriction that they must be qualified, would there (should there) ever be conflicts with anything else imported or locally defined?<br></p><p>It seems to me we could simplify it all down to just:<br></p><p>import Lib              // Works just like in Swift 2, qualified or not.<br>import Lib (Foo, bar)   // Only Foo and bar unqualified, others like Lib.qux.<br>import Lib ()           // Everything must be qualified: Lib.Foo etc.<br>import Lib hiding (qux) // Everything but baz works unqualified, and all like Lib.qux.<br>import Lib as L         // Import all unqualified, allow qualification under L like L.Foo.<br>import Lib as L (Foo)   // Only Foo unqualified, others under L like L.bar.<br>import Lib as L ()      // Everything must be qualified under L like L.Foo etc.<br>import Lib as L hiding (qux) // ..., qux must be qualified like L.qux.<br></p><p>Wouldn&#39;t that work pretty nicely, with minimal additions to syntax?<br></p><p>— Pyry<br></p><p>P.S. Okay, I can come up with a somewhat contrived corner case: What to do with modules whose names collide with type names imported unqualified, e.g. https://github.com/robrix/Either &lt;https://github.com/robrix/Either&gt; ?<br></p><p>import Lib // defines bar like above (1)<br></p><p>struct Lib {<br>    static func bar() {} // (2)<br>}<br></p><p>Lib.bar() // Which one gets called, (1) or (2)?<br></p><p>One might suggest the above call resolved to the locally defined function. How about if struct Lib was defined in another module that was also imported?<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160107/7ec255f8/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>Beef up Imports</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>December 28, 2015 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Dec 26, 2015, at 9:12 PM, Developer via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I opened a radar a while ago about improving the import syntax in Swift and haven’t received much of a response, so I’ll try to expand on my thoughts in there here.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I’ve always been in love with the way Agda does Modules and imports.  The syntax is wonderfully natural, and the features it provides are surprisingly useful given their simplicity.  Because Swift forbids the redeclaration of names between structs, enums, classes, and typealiases, I don’t believe that the existing qualified import syntax is needed.  Therefore, I propose the introduction of 3 agda-esque operations for imports to replace the usual `import {func|typealias|struct|class|enum|etc.}` syntax:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	• import Foo using (bar, Baz, qux, corge, …)<br>&gt; 	• import Foo hiding (bar, baz, qux, corge, …)<br>&gt; 	• import Foo renaming (grault to garply, waldo to fred, …)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The first of these is used to introduce a limited set of identifiers into scope, the second to import all but the given identifiers, and the third to rename identifiers at the module level.  Again, it should be obvious by uniqueness of identifiers what each one is referencing, so qualification of each identifier is unnecessary.  If more context is needed, or more granularity, a Haskell-esque <br></p><p>+1 for this general direction, if not this specific syntax.
