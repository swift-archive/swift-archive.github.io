When you cast using `as`, Swift will do the conversion through its Objective-C bridge, and will attempt to use a custom subclass of NSNumber that remembers the exact Swift type it was bridged as, such as Float or Double. There&#39;s a small chance your library is making assumptions that it&#39;s working with one of the standard NSNumber subclasses used by the Foundation implementation.
