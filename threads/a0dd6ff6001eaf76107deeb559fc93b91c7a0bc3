I saw someone tweet about this file the other day, and it took me a while to find it in the utils directory. It was a great read, but also kind of a pain as one long doc because I preferred to read from the oldest notes to the most recent. I was thinking it might make sense to split it out into separate files based on the release dates, and move them into a subdirectory of the docs directory. For example:<br></p><p>docs/release-notes/2014-10-09-release-notes.md<br></p><p>Or something similar.
