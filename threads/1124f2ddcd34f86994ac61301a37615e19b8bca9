Thanks!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; — Harlan Haskins<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; #warning<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Proposal: SE-NNNN &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/NNNN-name.md&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Author: Harlan Haskins &lt;https://github.com/harlanhaskins&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Status: Awaiting review &lt;https://gist.github.com/harlanhaskins/bfe2d56d7655c5bfdb1855eaf00addb4#rationale&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Review manager: TBD<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/harlanhaskins/bfe2d56d7655c5bfdb1855eaf00addb4#introduction&gt;Introduction<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s really common for developers to add TODO/FIXME comments in their source code, but there currently isn&#39;t a supported facility to make these visible. People have implemented special workarounds &lt;https://bendodson.com/weblog/2014/10/02/showing-todo-as-warning-in-swift-xcode-project/&gt; to coax Xcode into emitting TODOs and FIXMEs as warnings, but there isn&#39;t an accessible way to provide arbitrary warnings, and does not work in a non-Xcode environment.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/harlanhaskins/bfe2d56d7655c5bfdb1855eaf00addb4#motivation&gt;Motivation<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; A #warning is for something you intend to fix before submitting your code or for writing future tasks that you or your teammates intend to complete later. Because this is such a common programming pattern, Swift should have a similar facility.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/harlanhaskins/bfe2d56d7655c5bfdb1855eaf00addb4#proposed-solution&gt;Proposed solution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Add #warning(_:) as a new compiler directive that emits a warning diagnostic with the contents, pointing to the start of the message.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; func configPath() -&gt; String {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   #warning(&quot;TODO: load this more safely&quot;) // expected-warning {{TODO: load this more safely}}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   return Bundle.main().path(forResource: &quot;Config&quot;, ofType: &quot;plist&quot;)!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/harlanhaskins/bfe2d56d7655c5bfdb1855eaf00addb4#detailed-design&gt;Detailed design<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This will add two new productions to the Swift grammar:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; compiler-control-statement → warning-directive<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; warning-directive → #warning( static-string-literal )<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Upon parsing this statement, the Swift compiler will immediately emit a warning and discard the statement.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If a #warning exists inside a branch of a #if statement that is not taken, then no warning is emitted.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; #if false<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; #warning(“This won’t exist”)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; #endif<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/harlanhaskins/bfe2d56d7655c5bfdb1855eaf00addb4#impact-on-existing-code&gt;Impact on existing code<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This change is purely additive; no migration will be required.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/harlanhaskins/bfe2d56d7655c5bfdb1855eaf00addb4#alternatives-considered&gt;Alternatives considered<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; We could do some kind of comment-parsing based approach to surface TODOs and FIXMEs, but #warning serves as a general-purpose facility for reporting at compile time. Plus, not all TODO or FIXME comments should surface as warnings in the source.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160529/be8b9bd1/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] #warning</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>May 29, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On May 28, 2016, at 8:26 PM, Jon Shier via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	I appreciate the sentiment, but I think we should reserve warnings for actual compiler diagnostics.<br></p><p>+1.

Our task is to look at whether the problem is real and significant enough to solve, and if the proposal solves it in the best possible way consistent with the rest of Swift.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; An similar example is &quot;#pragma mark”.  Instead of introducing language support for it, we codified a comment marker (since it is semantically identical to a comment).

In C compilers, many of the warnings produced *should* be errors, but can’t be because that effects language conformance and could break a large body of code.  Swift doesn’t have this problem, so it treats warnings as “things that should be addressed before you commit your patch, but shouldn’t block a build if (e.g.) you’re in the middle of a big refactoring”.  For example, an unused variables is a warning in Swift.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This difference in policy is what makes me question where #warning makes sense for Swift.  OTOH, errors in Swift are used in exactly the same way as in C compilers, which is why bringing #error forward makes sense to me.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Chris<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b3f5abbe48b7127e20fd69808c714bf?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] #warning</strong> from <string>Charlie Monroe</string> &lt;charlie at charliemonroe.net&gt;<p>May 30, 2016 at 07:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; As to #warning, Swift’s use of warnings are significant different than the use in C.

Our task is to look at whether the problem is real and significant enough to solve, and if the proposal solves it in the best possible way consistent with the rest of Swift.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; An similar example is &quot;#pragma mark”.  Instead of introducing language support for it, we codified a comment marker (since it is semantically identical to a comment).  Xcode picks it up and does the right thing, and I think it has worked out well.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; As to #warning, Swift’s use of warnings are significant different than the use in C.  In C compilers, many of the warnings produced *should* be errors, but can’t be because that effects language conformance and could break a large body of code.  Swift doesn’t have this problem, so it treats warnings as “things that should be addressed before you commit your patch, but shouldn’t block a build if (e.g.) you’re in the middle of a big refactoring”.  For example, an unused variables is a warning in Swift.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; This sounds exactly like what I’d use #warning for. “I’m in the middle of a big refactoring, and I haven’t gotten to this part yet; let me put a warning in so I can test the other part but won’t forget to come back to it.” It might also make sense for doing a series of commits on a branch when you need to fix something before merging back to trunk.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; +1 to the proposal, and Jordan has captured my feelings very well here so I won’t repeat him.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I think it is important for such diagnostics to show up in compilation, not just in IDEs, especially with people using the Swift Package Manager. We could have the compiler parse every comment looking for TODOs and FIXMEs by default, and emit those as warnings, but I’d want to find out if that creates a noticeable difference in parsing time.
