If we port any of it to Swift we’d  first need some assurance of binary compatibility.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; (Also, if you really mean all of the code in a process, that implies that Apple can’t implement any system frameworks in Swift. So it seems that this question ties in with the earlier one of “how long do we have to copy multi-megabyte compatibility shim libraries into our apps that use Swift?”)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ((At the risk of sounding flamey: this sort of confirms my rule of thumb that Swift version numbers have their decimal points misplaced. IMHO, ABI stability is a requirement for a true 1.0 release of a language that has dynamic loading.))<br>&gt; <br>&gt; —Jens<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-users mailing list<br>&gt; swift-users at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-users<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-users mailing list<br>&gt; swift-users at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-users<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/969b04d28c02f951ccc03f615b9a92b3?s=50"></div><header><strong>Can Swift 2.3 frameworks be used with a Swift 3.0 app?</strong> from <string>Dmitri Gribenko</string> &lt;gribozavr at gmail.com&gt;<p>June 27, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Mon, Jun 27, 2016 at 9:05 AM, Kenny Leung via swift-users<br>&lt;swift-users at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; Hmm… This sounds like a big weakness with the Swift Package Manager.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Since it downloads and compiles sources, frameworks that might otherwise be binary compatible to link with might not build and work when you update your dev tools.<br></p><p>Swift 2.3 and 3.0 are not binary compatible.<br></p><p>Dmitri<br></p><p>-- <br>main(i,j){for(i=2;;i++){for(j=2;j&lt;i;j++){if(!(i%j)){j=0;break;}}if<br>(j){printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,i);}}} /*Dmitri Gribenko &lt;gribozavr at gmail.com&gt;*/<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/edbd5f1c2f535b14165ae883fa7c3f37?s=50"></div><header><strong>Can Swift 2.3 frameworks be used with a Swift 3.0 app?</strong> from <string>Jens Alfke</string> &lt;jens at mooseyard.com&gt;<p>June 27, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jun 27, 2016, at 8:59 AM, zh ao &lt;owenzx at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Not with current Swift 3.

While source breaking changes to the language have been the norm for Swift 1 through 3, we would like the Swift 3.x (and Swift 4+) languages to be as source compatible with Swift 3.0 as reasonably possible.<br></p><p>I’m asking about binary compatibility, not source compatibility; they’re not the same. For example, the Objective-C language has gone through many major changes since 2001, but the runtime has only broken binary compatibility once (and that was done in a way that didn’t affect any existing code, by putting it into the 64-bit transition on OS X and into the brand-new iOS.)<br></p><p>—Jens<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20160627/7a91d727/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dad914360cd4f72a2794d2d51acfbc38?s=50"></div><header><strong>Can Swift 2.3 frameworks be used with a Swift 3.0 app?</strong> from <string>Ted Bradley</string> &lt;ted.bradley at hudl.com&gt;<p>June 27, 2016 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Thanks – I really appreciate the definitive answer. <br></p><p>I’m worried a lot of people don’t realise this when doing their planning for the next few months – the migration guide is a little bit ambiguous on this front:<br></p><p>“Wait until the upstream open-source project updates to Swift 2.3 or Swift 3”<br>- https://swift.org/migration-guide/#using-carthagecocoapods-projects<br></p><p>If read optimistically, one could easily think that the update of the upstream open-source project doesn’t have to be to the same Swift version as ones own project...<br></p><p>- Ted<br></p><p>From: &lt;daniel_dunbar at apple.com&gt; on behalf of Daniel Dunbar &lt;daniel_dunbar at apple.com&gt;<br>Date: Monday, 27 June 2016 at 16:30<br>To: Ted Bradley &lt;ted.bradley at hudl.com&gt;<br>Cc: &quot;swift-users at swift.org&quot; &lt;swift-users at swift.org&gt;<br>Subject: Re: [swift-users] Can Swift 2.3 frameworks be used with a Swift 3.0 app?<br></p><p>No, this is not possible.
