The ax is already at the root of the tree; We are just trying to make sure it falls safely. Once it is on the ground, we will make lumber and some firewood, then we will build a cabin with a nice porch. We will invite the neighbors to celebrate by making s&#39;mores on the fire provided by the fallen tree.
