It’s the<br>&gt; nature of them to be an internal unknown value, or nil, that must be<br>&gt; unwrapped deliberately for the protection of your code’s logic. This seems<br>&gt; to me to be a slippery slope to the very thing optionals are trying to<br>&gt; avoid: default values based on the “zero / bool” conflation.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Additionally, what would that pattern mean for types that cannot be<br>&gt; initialised without parameters? If your proposal cannot support anything<br>&gt; well beyond the most primitive types, I suspect it doesn’t scale well and<br>&gt; shouldn’t come into the language.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; If you wish to use defaulting values, it’s best that you specify them<br>&gt; instead of hoping the language specifies the one that you assume it will.<br>&gt; Do this with the nil coalescing operator (??):<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; print(temp ?? “”)<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; if myString?.isEmpty ?? true {…}<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; if myBool ?? false {…}<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; if (myInt ?? 0) &gt; otherInt {…}<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; This is only slightly more code, but it removes all your assumptions,<br>&gt; and means you are now the specifier in your code’s logic. You can see from<br>&gt; the code exactly what nil will do, and what effect it had on your code.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; - Rod<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; On 11 May 2016, at 10:26 PM, Basem Emara via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe I’m missing something, but aren’t these the default values of<br>&gt; primitives deep in the language?<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; String = “”<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Int = 0<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Boolean = false<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So if you needed a different default value for your code, you’d do:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; if !myBool?! {…} //Default to true in my app<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; You can still do which is better:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; if myBool ?? true {…}<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Probably booleans is not a clear gain, but for strings it would have<br>&gt; vast conveniences.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On May 11, 2016, at 8:20 AM, Patrick Smith &lt;pgwsmith at gmail.com&gt;<br>&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I actually think this is less safe.
