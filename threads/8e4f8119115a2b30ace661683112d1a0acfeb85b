I think in part of the problem is simply that it’s extra detail to add, which is kind of strange in Swift when we have all our time savers like type inference and the simplified forms of closures; it makes more sense to add an attribute in the less common case, which in my experience is having a method result that may not be needed.<br></p><p>I’d liken it to mutable variables that you don’t actually mutate; it’s an error I run into all the time, but I’d rather have false positives then miss cases. It’s also important on structs with both mutating and non-mutating options; while the choice of let or var should keep you right much of the time, sometimes you do want a copy from a mutable value, so a mistakenly typing .reverse() instead of .reversed() for example is a mistake that result usage warnings can help prevent, but as long as developers keep forgetting to add @warn_unused_result it’s a warning that may not come up when it’s really needed =)<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>Make non-void functions @warn_unused_result by default</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>February 24, 2016 at 08:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Feb 24, 2016, at 3:45 PM, Janosch Hildebrand via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; No worries, there should be plenty of time for discussion.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Swift 3 contains many changes that will require libraries to be updated anyway, so I don’t think this would prove to be an undue burden.<br></p><p>Agreed - source breaking changes in Swift 3 are already a given, so we’re going to provide a really great migrator to help move people forward.
