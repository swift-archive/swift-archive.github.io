I think for these purposes there should be a single named declaration, with others simply referring to the same variable. To expand upon the example a bit, let’s say I tweaked Foo.B to take a second value:<br></p><p>	enum Foo {<br>		case A(Int)<br>		case B(Int, Float)<br>	}<br></p><p>Although it’s now no longer directly comparable to A, I’d still like to be able to do the following:<br></p><p>	switch anInstanceOfFoo {<br>		case .A(let value), .B(value, _):<br>			doSomethingInCommon(value)<br>	}<br></p><p>In other words, this is fine because although B has a value not in common with A, it isn’t being used, i.e- only variables with a common type are being used and extracted to a constant named value, so everything’s okay.<br></p><p>Feedback welcome, also if anyone can think of something better to call this I’d love suggestions on that as well ;)<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d68c97e8e2f1653b54c24493caf236ae?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pre-proposal] Allow multiple compatible enum cases in switch cases with named variables</strong> from <string>Stephen Celis</string> &lt;stephen.celis at gmail.com&gt;<p>February 26, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Feb 26, 2016, at 8:54 AM, Haravikk via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; However, the following isn’t currently possible:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	switch anInstanceOfFoo {<br>&gt; 		case .A(let value), .B(let value):<br>&gt; 			doSomethingInCommon(value)<br>&gt; 	}<br></p><p>I believe it is possible as of 18 hours ago :)<br></p><p>https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1383<br></p><p>Stephen<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
