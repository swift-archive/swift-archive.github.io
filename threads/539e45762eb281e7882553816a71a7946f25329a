The trickiest part was getting the C headers for the Apple System Log exposed as a Swift module &lt;https://github.com/emaloney/AppleSystemLogSwiftPackage&gt; so it could be imported by the CleanroomASL &lt;https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomASL&gt; dependency. (The Swift Package Manager doesn&#39;t support bridging headers, which makes hooking up to non-Swift code a bit cumbersome. Thanks to the kind folks on the swift-build-dev mailing list, I got it sorted.)<br></p><p>I built a command line tool with &#39;swift build&#39; and was able to &#39;import CleanroomLogger&#39; by specifying a dependency like the following in a Package.swift file:<br></p><p>import PackageDescription<br></p><p>let package = Package(<br>    dependencies: [<br>        .Package(url: &quot;https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomLogger&quot;, versions: Version(1,5,6) ..&lt; Version(2,0,0))<br>    ]<br>)<br></p><p>With this package, I created a main.swift file:<br></p><p>import CleanroomLogger<br></p><p>Log.enable(synchronousMode: true)<br></p><p>Log.info?.trace()<br></p><p>And built &amp; ran it from the Terminal:<br></p><p>   INFO | main.swift:5 — loggertest<br></p><p>It worked!!!<br></p><p>Very gratifying to see Swift package manager build something without too much effort.<br></p><p><br></p><p>&gt; On Dec 9, 2015, at 3:59 PM, Gage Morgan &lt;gagemorgan at outlook.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Please port it.

I&#39;d love for the CleanroomLogger API to be universally available on any Swift platform, and to ship with that support built-in.<br></p><p>Swift Package Manager support is a pre-requisite for that, because as of now CleanroomLogger only builds in Xcode.
