The<br>&gt; only changes that had to be made were the result of Objective-C API in the<br>&gt; project itself that had not yet been annotated with nullability information. In<br>&gt; addition, it ended up revealing a programming error in one project where a<br>&gt; property had been unintentionally inferred to have IUO type. I presented these<br>&gt; results at the Swift core team review meeting.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Jordan Rose expressed some concern that this sampling of projects didn’t really<br>&gt; say anything about the effect of these changes on projects that depend on<br>&gt; unaudited API, especially the Linux case. So I investigated the effect of this<br>&gt; proposal on building swiftpm, which makes extensive use of POSIX C API. It ended<br>&gt; up requiring ten new uses of the ! operator (out of 14k lines of Swift) to get<br>&gt; building again; they were all return values from C API (ctime_r, getcwd, getenv,<br>&gt; strerror, realpath) that had been saved to intermediate variables. Jordan<br>&gt; observes that most of the cases are better expressed with “if let” or “guard<br>&gt; let” statements anyway.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; We have concluded that we should move forward with implementing the<br>&gt; proposal.<br></p><p>NICE!<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
