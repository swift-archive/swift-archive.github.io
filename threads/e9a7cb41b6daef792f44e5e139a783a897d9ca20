The current implementation feels clunky to use, especially isEqualTo: <br></p><p>I can see points where getting the enum value can be valuable for instance a switch control flow and don&#39;t think the current API should be deprecated immediately, but using the comparable operators feels more readable and fits in more with swift&#39;s style.<br></p><p>Strideable also seems very fitting and having looked up the reference, would cover comparable and equatable as well. I also feel that there could be some sort of enum built that would return the TimeInterval value for the human readable version. For example advanceBy(.Day) would fit dateByAddingTimeInterval(86400)<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
