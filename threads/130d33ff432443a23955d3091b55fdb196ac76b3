I believe that I’ll be able to use the same object files using the binutils linker, so the mechanics in place for gold will function in both cases.  I don’t know if there is another compelling reason for keeping it.  Thoughts?<br></p><p>Second, Orlando believes that it’s possible to use C++ to generate the object files rather that assembler.  This would make these source files much more portable and easier to maintain.  There is a catch, however. In the assembler version there is no runtime impact at all; the C++ version requires a subtraction at load time.  The cost is pretty minimal, but it’s worth considering.  Changing from one implementation to another is very simple.<br></p><p>Finally, tying in the discussion of multi-architecture/multi-sdk cross compilation on linux, I noticed that swift.ld is copied to a 2-d array of SDKs and Architectures.  Considering that effory this effort (may?) not support a functional use case anyway, is it desirable to keep this behavior?  It would certainly simplify the generation of the object files.  I’ve already done the work, so it’s not that I’m trying to avoid it. ;)<br></p><p>Thanks again for your comments and thoughts,<br>- Will<br></p><p>&gt; On Jan 14, 2016, at 9:26 PM, William Dillon via swift-dev &lt;swift-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jan 14, 2016, at 9:19 PM, Joe Groff &lt;jgroff at apple.com &lt;mailto:jgroff at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jan 14, 2016, at 11:07 AM, William Dillon via swift-dev &lt;swift-dev at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-dev at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.
