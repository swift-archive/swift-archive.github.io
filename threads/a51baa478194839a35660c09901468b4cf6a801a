However it does mean that the dev team doesn&#39;t have the<br>&gt; same restrictions on design and implementation that we do. This also means<br>&gt; that the dev team is essentially using a different version of Swift and<br>&gt; that will inform their decisions on what Swift needs and how it should be<br>&gt; used.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As for writing the compiler in Swift, I think this would be great, I<br>&gt; haven&#39;t read Colin&#39;s article yet but it sounds like a valid concern.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It&#39;s a huge undertaking and perhaps something that can be done<br>&gt; incrementally by the community as well.
