The proposal has been accepted. Support for the initial proposal was positive on the concept but mixed on the details, and the proposal was revised accordingly; the second review has received limited comments, but the comments were positive. Apple will start committing implementation for this proposal soon, though community pull requests are welcome; please discuss this on swift-build-dev at swift.org if you&#39;d like to help with the implementation.<br></p><p>The accepted review can be found at https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0019-package-manager-testing.md &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0019-package-manager-testing.md&gt;.<br></p><p>This initial proposal includes support for using XCTest; we expect that adding generic support for other testing frameworks will be discussed in an upcoming proposal.<br></p><p>Thank you all for your comments.<br></p><p>	- Rick<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev/attachments/20160121/e3da559c/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
