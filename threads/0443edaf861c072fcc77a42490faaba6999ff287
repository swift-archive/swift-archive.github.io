As part of my current<br>research, I&#39;m studying the implications of open-sourcing a proprietary<br>software, for instance, if the project succeed in attracting newcomers.<br>Swift was in my list.<br></p><p>To further analyze the impacts of Swiftâ€™s migration, we analyzed the git<br>log commit history of your project in terms of _number of contributions_,<br>_number of newcomers_, and _number of contributors per month_. The<br>following figure presents a temporal perspective regarding these three<br>measures.<br>[image: Inline image 1]<br>Given the numbers presented in the graphic, we would like to ask Swift<br>developers the following questions:<br></p><p>1. What motivated the project to open its source code at Github? How do you<br>evaluate the benefits of this migration?<br>2. Does this snapshot make sense? Did you find any inconsistency on the<br>data?<br>3. Do you have any internal policy to promote/attract/retain newcomers? If<br>so, do them succeed?<br>4. Did you expect a high number of newcomers joining the project right<br>after it became open-source?<br>5. Although several developers that joined the project placed their very<br>first contribution in a very short amount of time, most of them did not<br>keep contributing in the following days. Why do you believe this happens?<br></p><p>Thanks in advance for your collaboration,<br></p><p>Gustavo Pinto, PhD<br>http://www.gustavopinto.org<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160606/0443f287/attachment.html&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>A non-text attachment was scrubbed...<br>Name: swift.png<br>Type: image/png<br>Size: 20776 bytes<br>Desc: not available<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160606/0443f287/attachment.png&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
