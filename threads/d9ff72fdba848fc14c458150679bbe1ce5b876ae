While the type is in some sense a &quot;property&quot; of the instance, it has always been a bit strange to have it there:<br></p><p>* `dynamicType` acts sort of like an extension of `Any`, but you&#39;re not actually allowed to extend `Any`.<br>* Using property syntax forced the designers to avoid the most obvious name, `type`, because users might want that name for their own purposes.<br>* Similar &quot;universal&quot; properties, like getting the size of an instance or reflecting it, are exposed as free functions. A fair number of the standard library&#39;s free functions could reasonably be exposed as members of `Any` or `AnyObject`, yet `dynamicType` was singled out for this treatment.<br></p><p>I am not convinced, however, by this proposal&#39;s argument against renaming to `typeof(_:)`. In a very brief survey of languages with a `typeof` operation (or some extremely similar keyword, like `TypeOf` or `type-of`), I found:<br></p><p>LANGUAGES WITH ONLY STATIC TYPES<br></p><p>* C: Textual substitution (more or less) of static type. (C++ and Objective-C inherit this from C.)<br></p><p>LANGUAGES WITH ONLY DYNAMIC TYPES<br></p><p>* Javascript: Dynamic type (string)<br>* R: Dynamic type (string)<br>* ActionScript: Dynamic type (string)<br>* Common Lisp: Dynamic type<br></p><p>LANGUAGES WITH BOTH<br></p><p>* D: Textual substitution (more or less) of static type, like C<br>* Crystal: Static type<br>* C#: N/A; used only with type names, in a similar role to `self` in Swift 2&#39;s `SomeType.self`<br></p><p>* Go: Dynamic type<br>* Visual Basic: Dynamic type<br>* GNU Pascal: Dynamic type<br></p><p>My conclusion is that, for the most part, languages use `typeof` in one of two ways:<br></p><p>	1) It is part of their type grammar, where it represents a static type.<br></p><p>	2) It is part of their expression grammar, where it represents a dynamic type.<br></p><p>(In Crystal, `typeof` is part of both grammars, and always represents a static type. C# uses it in a weird, idiosyncratic way.)<br></p><p>If Swift were to support category 1, it would almost certainly be considered &quot;compiler magic&quot; and thus be spelled `#typeof`. So I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much ambiguity in what `typeof(_:)` would mean in Swift.<br></p><p>Given that using it to mean &quot;dynamic type&quot; is highly precedented in other languages, and given that it is much shorter than `dynamicType` and matches an existing pattern in the standard library, I believe we should use the name `typeof` instead of `dynamicType`.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. Let&#39;s get rid of this compromised weirdness.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. We&#39;ve been clearing out these kinds of cobwebs a lot lately.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>Most languages where I&#39;ve used this kind of thing use `class` to return the dynamic type, but this isn&#39;t a sensible option in Swift, which has richly-typed instances which aren&#39;t classes.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>I wouldn&#39;t quite call this review &quot;in-depth&quot;, but I put maybe an hour of work into it.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d53b7c5f9b5f5557b9082face9b632a0?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0096: Converting dynamicType from a property to an operator</strong> from <string>Dave Abrahams</string> &lt;dabrahams at apple.com&gt;<p>May 25, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>on Tue May 24 2016, Chris Lattner &lt;clattner-AT-apple.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The review of &quot;SE-0096: Converting dynamicType from a property to an operator&quot; begins now and runs through May 30.

The proposal is available here:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0096-dynamictype.md<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Reviews are an important part of the Swift evolution process. All reviews should be sent to the swift-evolution mailing list at<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>&gt; or, if you would like to keep your feedback private, directly to the review manager.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What goes into a review?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review through constructive criticism and contribute to the direction of Swift. When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt; 	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thank you,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Chris Lattner<br>&gt; Review Manager<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0096: Converting dynamicType from a property to an operator</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>May 25, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Isn&#39;t `dynamictype` different from `sizeof` or `typeof` in that it does evaluate it&#39;s argument?<br></p><p>`sizeofValue(_:)` in Swift also evaluates its argument.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
