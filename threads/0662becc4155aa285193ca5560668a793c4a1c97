This *might* change if the proposal for iterating over a tuple goes through... An object could, I think, store all its non-computed properties in a tuple, and if *that* is equatable, then a generic == could probably be written.<br></p><p>The obvious reply is, &quot;Well then why not use compiler magic&quot;, to which I say, &quot;Because it&#39;s better to extend the language than to rely on compiler magic.&quot;<br></p><p>IMHO, this sounds like is one of several suggestions that most people will probably want, but that simply can&#39;t be done until Swift gains either a mechanism for generically processing tuples, and/or a macro system, both of which have been declared out of scope until it&#39;s time to start talking about Swift 3.<br></p><p>- Dave Sweeris<br></p><p>&gt; On Feb 12, 2016, at 14:47, Daniel Tartaglia via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In Haskell, we can mark a data block as deriving from Eq and it will auto-generate the == operator.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I would like to see Swift auto-generate the == operator if a struct implements Equatable.

I get that extending the derived function has other complexities, but I’ve had complex types in the past (not in Swift) that would have been a lot cleaner if I could just use the derived result for most values, then tweak a few somehow. I just think it’s worth considering, even if that’s just “yeah we could do that later maybe”, but it’s a possible reason for preferring an actual keyword as it that same keyword could then be used in the extended operator.<br></p><p>Either way I think we still need an attribute so that properties can be opted out of the auto-generation, as it lets the feature be used on types with cache properties and other values that don’t need to be compared, which extends its usefulness to more cases; I can think of a dozen or so of my own types which essentially just have boiler-plate equality operators, but which also have properties that need to be ignored, so couldn’t make the switch to auto-generation.<br></p><p>Also, I just wanted to add as well that my vote’s for a derived/deriving keyword; the # prefix for compiler directives suggests to me that something may be compiled away, however if we’re using it to mark Equatable then this isn’t the case as the result is still always going to be Equatable. One other alternative is to just use some kind of decorative “magic” protocol, e.g- AutoEquatable (extending Equatable) that is handled with some compiler magic in the short term, and perhaps some other mechanism in future once we get reflection and other goodies.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160214/1799abfd/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3d118cdf2fe31053bc7032466c4da282?s=50"></div><header><strong>Auto-generate op==?</strong> from <string>Craig Cruden</string> &lt;ccruden at novafore.com&gt;<p>February 14, 2016 at 12:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>That is Haskel’s Algebraic Data Type is it not?
