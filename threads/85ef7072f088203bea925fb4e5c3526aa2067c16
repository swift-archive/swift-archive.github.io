Last strong reference removed<br>&gt; 2. All `willDeinit` observers are invoked. It is illegal to resurrect an object in these callbacks.<br>&gt; 3. All weak references are zeroed.<br>&gt; 4. All `didDeinit` observers are invoked, potentially asynchronously.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The `willDeinit` cannot be merged with the `willSet` because of the additional non-resurrection constraints.<br>&gt; The `didDeinit` could be merged with the `didSet`. Although a `didSet` without a preceding `willSet` is kind of strange.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Property would look like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; weak var x: T? {<br>&gt;    willSet {<br>&gt;        // Not called on automatic zeroing.<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt;    didSet {<br>&gt;        // Not called on automatic zeroing.<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt;    willDeinit {<br>&gt;        // Object is dying.<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt;    didDeinit {<br>&gt;        // Object has died sometime ago.<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Alternatively, allow object resurrection between the removal of the last strong reference and the completion of all `willDeinit` callbacks.<br>&gt; `willDeinit` becomes advisory in this case, and may be called multiple times. Maybe `willTryToDeinit` would be clearer in the meaning.<br>&gt; Only if all `willTryToDeinit` callbacks completed and the object is not resurrected, the references are zeroed and `didDeinit` callbacks are called.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This way, the developer doesn&#39;t need to care about special restrictions that apply to `willDeinit`.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Maybe `unsafeWillDeinit` would be an okay name if you go with the restricted `willDeinit` to scare novices away from that area (similar to pointers).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Etan<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On 14 Dec 2015, at 22:06, Greg Parker via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Dec 13, 2015, at 6:24 PM, Michael Henson via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The use-case for this comes first from proposals to have a weak-reference version of collection types. Implementing a notification signal of some sort to weak reference-holders when the reference becomes nil would make implementing those more straightforward.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; How do you want this to work in the presence of threads?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; One option is that the nil transition and the callbacks are performed together, synchronously and atomically with respect to some things. The problem with this scheme is that the callback is limited in what it can do. If it does the wrong thing it will deadlock. The definition of &quot;wrong thing&quot; depends in part on the definition of &quot;atomically with respect to some things&quot;. For example, if the callbacks are called atomically with respect to other weak reference writes then the callback must not store to any weak references of its own.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Another option is that the callbacks are performed asynchronously some time after the nil transition itself.
