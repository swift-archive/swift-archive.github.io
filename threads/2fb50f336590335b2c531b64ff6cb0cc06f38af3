Have you?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I do ;)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; One thing I really love about Swift’s external names is the ability to<br>&gt; make my function calls read a lot like natural language, but in doing<br>&gt; so actually clarify how a parameter is used, potentially eliminating<br>&gt; the need to consult documentation at all.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Granted “with” may not be the best word, but in the example it implies<br>&gt; to me more that the data itself is being returned, rather than being<br>&gt; used to generate some kind of other response, whereas “data” on its<br>&gt; own might require me to check to be sure I’ve understand what the<br>&gt; function will do with that data.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; For example, I might declare methods like:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 	func find(theSearchTerm needle:String, inTheString haystack:String) -&gt; Range&lt;String.Index&gt;<br>&gt; 	let match = matcher.find(theSearchTerm: “find me”, inTheString: “see if you can find me in this”)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Still might not be the best example but hopefully it gives you the<br>&gt; idea. <br></p><p>Well, this is certainly a style we want the language to allow, but I&#39;m<br>just as certain it&#39;s not what we want the API guidelines to push people<br>toward...<br></p><p>&gt; Sometimes there’s verbosity for the sake of maintaining the pattern,<br>&gt; but the idea is to end up with self-documenting function<br>&gt; declarations. Of course I had SwiftDoc anyway for clarity and because<br>&gt; I’m an habitual documenter, but if a function can be understood purely<br>&gt; from how it’s used then that’s a good thing IMO. I should mention I’m<br>&gt; a huge fan of Applescript’s syntax (though I hate its performance).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Of course I realise we’re talking about converting Objective-C<br>&gt; functions, but while I don’t like the overly long function names (I<br>&gt; prefer functions with a similar action to have the same name) I do<br>&gt; like that some of them are self-documenting thanks to the added<br>&gt; verbosity, and I’m just concerned that we might lose some of that, as<br>&gt; personally I try to keep my functions fairly descriptive in my own<br>&gt; code.<br></p><p>...and the goal is to have the importer emulate conformance to the<br>guidelines.  But regarding your concern about clarity, do you feel the<br>prose you wrote above is unclear?  I notice you didn&#39;t write<br></p><p>  I’m just [a feeling]: concerned that [the subject of that feeling]: we<br>  might [a consequence]: lose [the object of that consequence]: some of<br>  that.<br></p><p>To me, that seems analogous to <br></p><p>   find(theSearchTerm: x)<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
