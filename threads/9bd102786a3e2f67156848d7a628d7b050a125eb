I have never heard of<br>&gt;&gt; it yet though, and googling it returns no relevant results. I do not<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; understand what binding memory is supposed to do.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The migration guide says &quot;Binding uninitialized memory to a type<br>&gt;&gt; prepares the memory to store values of that type“, but clearly raw<br>&gt;&gt; memory does not need to be prepared (and cannot be) to hold any<br>&gt;&gt; arbitrary type and value.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; So what is this for, what does it actually do, and to whom is it done (the raw pointer, or the<br>&gt; typed pointer which is returned, or the raw memory)?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Manfred<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hi Manfred,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; At the top of the migration guide is a link to the memory model explanation:<br>&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0107-unsaferawpointer.md#memory-model-explanation<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &quot;A memory location&#39;s bound type is an abstract, dynamic property of the memory used to formalize<br>&gt; type safety.”<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I’m not sure I like the “prepares the memory” language myself. Binding<br>&gt; memory communicates to the compiler that the memory locations are safe<br>&gt; for typed access. Nothing happens at runtime--until someone writes a<br>&gt; type safety sanitizer. <br></p><p>Well, that&#39;s a slight overstatement IMO.

Binding memory<br>&gt; returns a typed pointer for convenience and clarity, but there’s<br>&gt; nothing special about that particular pointer value.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Initialized memory is always bound to some type. A rawpointer can be<br>&gt; used to access that memory without knowing its bound type.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -Andy<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-users mailing list<br>&gt; swift-users at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-users<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fe87aed0d64cdbc46378bf7596a7553?s=50"></div><header><strong>What is &quot;binding&quot; memory?</strong> from <string>Andrew Trick</string> &lt;atrick at apple.com&gt;<p>November  2, 2016 at 03:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Nov 2, 2016, at 12:58 PM, Dave Abrahams via swift-users &lt;swift-users at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; At the top of the migration guide is a link to the memory model explanation:<br>&gt;&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0107-unsaferawpointer.md#memory-model-explanation<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; &quot;A memory location&#39;s bound type is an abstract, dynamic property of the memory used to formalize<br>&gt;&gt; type safety.”<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I’m not sure I like the “prepares the memory” language myself.
