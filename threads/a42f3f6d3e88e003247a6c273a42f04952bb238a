(Ruby&#39;s Rake vs Make/GNUMake come to mind a lot, or Ruby&#39;s Sinatra web framework come to mind, perhaps Python&#39;s Flask to  a lesser extent, and in general the way things can be constructed for tools like HTTP handling or similar.)<br></p><p>I think native Regular Expressions will enable a lot of things, but if it were possible to have more flexibility in the operator space, a lot could be possible.<br>My thinking is along the lines of class or struct internal operators or pseudo operators.<br>The infix operator pattern allows functions without parens. If these can be written to be human language characters, this enables many interesting DSL behaviors.<br></p><p>From thinking about Regular Expression support and how many languages use / to delimit Regular Expression literals, and provide special scoping rules that make escaping \ unnecessary, perhaps there is something to the scoping rules that might be more flexible, long-term?<br></p><p>Apologies if I have wandered off a bit on a tangent but the DSL space seems to tie these together potentially.<br></p><p>I would posit that making human language characters available rather than symbols will have a much greater productivity and creativity impact.
