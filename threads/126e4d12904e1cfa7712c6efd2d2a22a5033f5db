I think it is one of the big holes in swift’s grammar, and the sooner we find a way to express distributed ordering, the less churn it will cause when we make the change (and the more consistency we can have across language features which share this issue).  It doesn’t necessarily have to be fixed in this proposal though, as long as we don’t paint ourselves into a corner.<br></p><p>&gt; You get a compile error if there are two conformances of SomeWrapper to Equatable; it doesn’t actually matter whether they are conditional, but people are far more likely to expect to be able to having overlapping conditional conformances.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Slightly off-topic but I was hit quick badly by this recently because two libraries I was trying to import both conformed UIControlState to Hashable to be able to use it as Dictionary indices.

In this case, it would then act similarly to default implementations of protocols.  That is, it would provide conformance if no one else was, but defer to any other implementation which is available. This means library authors can provide basic conditional conformance without locking out more specific implementations.  This deferral would likely be on a method by method basis (similar to default protocol implementations), though the “weak” (or equivalent) annotation would apply to the extension as a whole.<br></p><p>Thanks,<br>Jon<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160929/126ef5db/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c450c87df0788b8e1f7a6ca17ea34c7?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal draft] Conditional conformances</strong> from <string>Douglas Gregor</string> &lt;dgregor at apple.com&gt;<p>September 29, 2016 at 08:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Sent from my iPhone<br></p><p>&gt; On Sep 29, 2016, at 7:45 PM, Jonathan Hull &lt;jhull at gbis.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; +1 to conditional conformances in general.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What other designs were considered and rejected?

I&#39;d like to see it addressed comprehensively, so we don&#39;t end up with one syntax in part of the language that doesn&#39;t work in another, similar part of the language. So it should cover &quot;I want to call this specific thing in this protocol extension defined in this other module...&quot; and &quot;I want to this method to implement that requirement of this specific protocol&quot; and such. <br></p><p>In a sense, this particular proposal doesn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; disambiguation because it bans ambiguities. <br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; You get a compile error if there are two conformances of SomeWrapper to Equatable; it doesn’t actually matter whether they are conditional, but people are far more likely to expect to be able to having overlapping conditional conformances.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Slightly off-topic but I was hit quick badly by this recently because two libraries I was trying to import both conformed UIControlState to Hashable to be able to use it as Dictionary indices.

There is some runtime validation we might need---for example, to make sure all of the conformances define the same associated type witnesses---but it&#39;s something we can probably do via lazy deduplication at runtime. <br></p><p>  - Doug<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks,<br>&gt; Jon<br>&gt; <br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160929/4ab627ff/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
