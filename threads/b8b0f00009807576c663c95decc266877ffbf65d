My apologies, I was trying to get through my email too fast and ended up skimming too much.<br></p><p>&gt; &gt; If we switched to `droppingPrefix(where:)` then we&#39;d need to change `dropFirst(_:)` as well.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Yes, as I noted in my response to Erica, I would like to see some more design<br>&gt; coherence in this whole area.  I think<br>&gt; <br>&gt;           xs.dropFirst()  =&gt;  xs.droppingFirst()<br>&gt;           xs.dropFirst(3) =&gt; xs.droppingPrefix(ofMaxLength: 3)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m not wedded to “dropping,” especially because it has other<br>&gt; connotations.

That said, having a first argument label &quot;ofMaxLength:&quot; seems overly verbose. Don&#39;t forget that not everybody has the benefit of Xcode code completion when writing Swift code.<br></p><p>&gt; Anyway, we can&#39;t do all of that by the seat of our pants.  I personally<br>&gt; wouldn&#39;t want to go any further than s.dropPrefix(where: ...)  without a<br>&gt; new proposal/review.<br></p><p>Agreed, anything beyond that needs a full review. So back to the suggestion at hand.<br></p><p>I wrote up a whole long explanation for why I still think &quot;while&quot; is the better choice, and then I thought about how this impacts `prefix(...:)` instead of `drop(...:)`, and in this context &quot;where:&quot; makes more sense. `prefix(while:)` turns &quot;prefix&quot; from a noun into a verb, and the verb meaning of &quot;prefix&quot; is not at all what we&#39;re doing with this operation. But `prefix(where:)` is still a noun and makes sense. And of course if we have `prefix(where:)` then it&#39;s a bit odd to have `drop(while:)`, so we&#39;d have to go with `drop(where:)` or `dropPrefix(where:)`. So I guess I&#39;ve now convinced myself while writing this email that &quot;where:&quot; is the right choice :D<br></p><p>That said, given that we already have `dropFirst(_:)`, maybe we should go with `dropFirst(where:)` instead of `dropPrefix(where:)`? Otherwise it&#39;s a bit odd to have both &quot;dropFirst&quot; and &quot;dropPrefix&quot; as names. Admittedly, this same argument applies to the existing `drop(while:)` name too, and I don&#39;t have a great explanation for that beyond the fact that I had a vague idea that dropFirst(_:) might be renamed to drop(first:), though that can&#39;t actually happen because having both dropFirst() and drop(first:) is hugely confusing, and it doesn&#39;t make sense to rename dropFirst() to drop().<br></p><p>-Kevin Ballard<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
