(Assuming that your use-case isn&#39;t just calculating factorial numbers for fun.) (E.g. if you try to calculate (52 over 3) by using the formula (52!/(49!*3!)) it will be inefficient, and btw it will crash, because 52! does not fit into an Int. The efficient way is 52*51/2*50/3 (&quot;*&quot;,&quot;/&quot;: same precedence, left-associative.)) On my 64-bit computer I cannot go beyond 20!, factorial(21) gives an EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION a.k.a. integer overflow. There is no point in optimizing 20!, and there certainly is no point in optimizing 40!, at least with Int&#39;s.<br></p><p>There is really no point in optimizing that anymore beyond that. A silly SIMD-optimized algorithm is always worse than a well-designed algorithm compiled with -O0. If you do standard optimization techniques first, the advantage of SIMD-instructions for factorial become unmeasurable ;)<br></p><p>However, I agree that special optimizations for numeric computations (SIMD and other extension) would be cool..<br></p><p>-Michael<br></p><p>&gt; Am 02.08.2016 um 18:37 schrieb Muse M via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m concern if simd could improve factorials code and faster timing.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; import simd<br>&gt; func factorial(n: Int) -&gt; Int {<br>&gt;     return n &lt; 1 ? 1 : n * factorial(n: n - 1)<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; print(factorial(n: 40))<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Wed, Aug 3, 2016 at 12:00 AM, Charlie Monroe &lt;charlie at charliemonroe.net&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; That&#39;s a good point. :)<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 5:55 PM, Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I&#39;m going to guess, since Musa mentioned science and engineering, that a good chunk of that work is floating point :)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Tue, Aug 2, 2016 at 10:41 AM, Charlie Monroe via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; Are you using the variants of operators without overflow check?
