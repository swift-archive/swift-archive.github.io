I have been seeing far to many proposals of the second variety of late.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jul 10, 2016, at 2:58 PM, Rod Brown &lt;rodney.brown6 at icloud.com &lt;mailto:rodney.brown6 at icloud.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I personally agree with most of your assessments. It&#39;s why I pushed so hard for &quot;allow subclassing my default&quot; in the first discussion of this point.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem with this is simple: you cannot retroactively &quot;close up&quot; an API. I cannot add final to a class I have previously declared as non-final. I also can seal a class which has previously been open to subclassing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Consider: someone builds against my framework and I do nothing, and they subclass my classes. Then later I come through and mark the classes as &quot;Sealed&quot;. What should we do with those classes that are subclassing my classes? Nothing. I can&#39;t. I permitted access and now I&#39;m beholden to that access level.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On the other hand, opening up access levels gradually has no such issues. Users of my class can&#39;t subclass, and then they can. They just have another tool in the bag now.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If you want a default, it should be one you can reverse later. Your default should not be the most restrictive.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Whilst I agree with most of your points, this core concept seems to trump them to my mind.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - Rod<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On 10 Jul. 2016, at 5:51 am, Jonathan Hull via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please stop saying that this proposal will bring more consideration to the design of libraries.  It isn’t true.  I haven’t even seen an argument for why it would be true, it is just taken for granted that it is true.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As I mentioned in another post, this is structurally very different from things like ‘if-let’ and optionals.  Optionals force the user to consider their decision in the context it is being used (i.e. as you use the optional/value).  This proposal, however, does the opposite.  The effect of your actions appear in the context of a completely different user.  It is like sitting in a room, flipping a light switch wondering “I wonder what this does?”… meanwhile the people downstairs are wondering why their lights keep turning off and on”.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can try to test for this, but by definition library authors can only test for scenarios that they have thought of.  I have often found people surprise me with their use-cases.  Relying on the diligence of other programmers is what leads to things like: &quot;You always need to remember to test for zero before using a pointer&quot;.  Literally the opposite of optionals!  It sounds good, but at the end of the day, people are human and they WILL make mistakes.  Best to either catch those mistakes in the context where they happen or to mitigate the effect of it.  This proposal basically forces you to feel the full effect of other people&#39;s mistakes (thinking that it will discourage them from making them in the first place).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your only real mechanism for feedback is when users of your library complain to you that something that they need isn’t subclass-able.  This is the point where most framework authors will actually learn that this feature/default exists.  Users of a framework will learn of it slightly earlier, when they find they need to subclass something, and it just isn’t possible.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would much prefer adding a ‘sealed’ keyword which library authors could use to annotate things which they do not want subclassed outside of the module.  Or preferably, as others have suggested, allow augmentation of ‘final’ with ‘public(final)&#39; or ‘internal(final)’.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The only case where I would support ‘sealed’ by default is if there are 3 levels: open, sealed, final.  Final would allow &#39;public(final)&#39; and &#39;internal(final)’ to allow private subclassing inside the file/module.  Sealed would be the same, except it would allow the user to subclass by explicitly acknowledging the risk using ‘unsafe’:  “unsafe class MySubclass:SealedSuper“ and  “unsafe override func”.  Final would not allow the override.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is the case where ‘sealed’ makes sense as a default…<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jon<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; P.S. The current proposal will only cause massive problems down the line, IMHO.  We will find an escape hatch is needed, but we will have made optimizations based on assumptions of finality which prevent us from easily adding one.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt; <br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160710/7920605e/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e9b374b9587bd8da1a1a027c8716ac0d?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Rod Brown</string> &lt;rodney.brown6 at icloud.com&gt;<p>July 11, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On 11 Jul 2016, at 12:33 PM, Jonathan Hull &lt;jhull at gbis.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It is pre-breaking in that it is the exact same code that doesn’t work in both cases (only in the pre-breaking case, a bunch of other code also doesn’t work).

I know it feels different because it “was never possible” vs our change being the cause, but it is one of those things like me giving you $5 or giving you $10 and later taking back $5.  As humans we are loss averse so we devise strategies to hide the loss from ourselves.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I completely disagree with this.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Not providing someone something due to risk of breakage is not the same thing as “giving it and taking it away”. We don’t build bridges out of spare parts and tell people “We build it but we expect it to break at some stage, so use with caution.” You either build it correctly, or you don’t let people cross the bridge. At All.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; This isn’t about “loss averse”. This is about risk management.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Where does the line lie on risk? That’s ultimately something the core team will have to decide.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; My point is that you are completely ignoring an entire class of risk that has a real-world $$$ cost.  Every time I have to use a framework under this proposal, I am now completely at the mercy of the author.  In the case of open source frameworks I can at least make a fork, but for closed source frameworks (often from large companies where us using their framework has been negotiated by the bosses) you have now just added weeks to my development cycle while I wait for big-company-who-doesn’t-really-care-that-much to update their stuff. (sure I can work on other things during that time, but delaying a launch isn’t free)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Are you offering to explain to my boss/client why I can’t add the feature in a reasonable timeframe like I can with Objective C frameworks?  That it may not even be possible now in Swift even though the Android guy just did it in a few hours?  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Do you know what I am going to tell my boss/client?  &quot;Don’t use Swift for frameworks” and “Try to avoid partnering with companies that have Swift frameworks”.  &quot;It is too much of a risk&quot;.  &quot;We are giving them too much control over the future of our product…&quot;  I mean, it even affects the prices that companies can charge for crappy frameworks. If I am asking for a bunch of features that I NEED them to add to provide a basic feature, that affects negotiations/price (vs a world where I can add it myself if needed).  Sealed-by-default gives them leverage.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; To use your bridge analogy, which is better in the case that you haven’t provided a bridge for me:<br>&gt; 1) I build my own bridge knowing that I will need to maintain it periodically (usually on a predictable schedule)<br>&gt; 2) Have everyone wait for 6 months (loosing $ the whole time) while I plead with you to build the bridge for me.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; By definition, the least thought through frameworks are the ones most likely to need workarounds, but under this proposal, they are also the ones we will be unable to fix.  I think some people think that this proposal will make them fix those frameworks or make them disappear… but they are often from big brand name companies, who don’t care that much because tech isn’t their main business.  In my experience, we can get the changes we need, but it takes anywhere from 2 months to a year.  Being able to patch in a stop-gap while we are waiting is very important for the health of the business.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; For example, I had a recent client that called me in a panic (unfortunately I have somehow gotten a reputation as someone to call for impossible tasks) because they had a demo they needed to show for a potential multimillion dollar deal and it just wasn’t working.  The tech they had used as a base wasn’t doing what it was supposed to… and the fixes were 3-6 months away (the demo was a week and a half away).  I would call the support guy for the tech, and they would tell me “that isn’t possible yet. Just wait for the update”.  I would call them back a couple of hours later saying “If someone else asks, here is how I did it…”  Was that code beautiful? No.  Did I get all the features in that demo working?  Yes, with something like 1 hour to spare.  The demo went very very well.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Should I have let that deal fall through because it wasn’t the “proper” ideological way to write code?  Sometimes things just need to get done and there isn’t another way….  A few people have suggested that these types of concerns aren’t relevant, but I find them very relevant to my everyday life.  This is the first proposal with the ability to actually cost me (and my clients) money.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I am completely ok with needing to type “unsafe” (or similar) to acknowledge and take responsibility for my actions in those situations.  I understand those modifications might break when the framework is finally updated in 3-6 months (hopefully we can even remove them at that point).  Just don’t “safety&quot; my clients out of business by making working around bad frameworks impossible.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; One last analogy.  At a restaurant, they might be afraid I would cut myself with a sharp knife.  They don’t force me to wear mittens or otherwise make using knifes impossible.  They give everyone butterknives, but I can always get a real knife if I ask for one.  If I order steak, I don’t even have to ask… they just bring me a real knife.  This is how Swift has been and should continue to be IMHO.  Prevent me from subclassing accidentally, but if I acknowledge the risk, let me do it.  “Safe-by-default” != “Impossible-by-default” <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks,<br>&gt; Jon<br>&gt; <br>&gt; P.S.

Should this become final at a later point, you have acknowledged you know this will be unsafe and are willing to take this risk to get the job done. This is opt-in risk.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Perhaps however this shouldn’t be “sealed” declaratively. Perhaps we just have a keyword for “Open” as an access level, and if you subclass or override things that are not “open” from other modules, you must mark unsafe.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I think this is a decent compromise: We allow potential to patch, but discourage without acknowledgement of the risk.
