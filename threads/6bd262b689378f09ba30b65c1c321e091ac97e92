We will also be locking master during the upgrade as we will be pushing back changes for both Swift 3 and Swift 2.3.  We have staged as much of the upgrade as possible, so we are hoping for a short downtime, however, it is possible it may take several hours.  (We have planned for up to four.) Weâ€™ll send out a message when the upgrade is complete.<br></p><p>At this time, we will also be cutting a swift-3.0-preview-2-branch.<br></p><p>As a reminder, once the upgrade is complete, if you are doing development on a Mac, the minimum required Xcode to build Swift from source will be the latest Xcode 8 beta.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160614/6bd27e92/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
