I wonder if we can use optionals to make this work in an elegant way.<br></p><p>Forget about else for a second.  What if there is an operation which says, this is either this value or nil based on whether it meets a condition?  Then else (and else if) can be handled by a combination of that operation and the nil-coelecing operator.<br></p><p>I once wrote a small DSL which had this behavior and it was really nice.<br></p><p>What about something like:<br></p><p>	let x = value if? condition<br></p><p>x would have value if condition evaluates to true, or it would be nil. If I wanted an else statement:<br></p><p>	let x = value if? condition ?? otherValue<br></p><p>Now it works just like the ternary operator, but is IMHO more readable.  Note: these can also be chained to give you else if style behavior:<br></p><p>	let x = value if? condition ?? otherValue if? otherCondition ?? evenMoreValue<br></p><p>You could optionally (ha!) put things in parentheses as well, which I always end up doing with the ternary:<br></p><p>	let x = (value if? condition) ?? (otherValue if? otherCondition) ?? evenMoreValue<br></p><p><br>Not a 100% there yet, but I do think it is a good start at something more elegant…<br></p><p>Thanks,<br>Jon<br></p><p><br></p><p>&gt; On Dec 5, 2015, at 10:29 AM, possen p &lt;possen at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The current ternary operator, for this example: <br>&gt; <br>&gt; let val = p == 5 ? 10 : 40               <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Which I have always thought was hard to read but I do like the functionality it provides.
