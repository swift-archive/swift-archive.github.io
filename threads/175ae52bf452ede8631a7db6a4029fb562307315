You can still use OSS toolchains to build apps, like you always could.<br>- You can only submit to the AppStore from the latest stable Xcode (7.3, isn’t it?)<br>- You can also deploy apps by manually building &amp; installing with Xcode, Ad-Hoc or Enterprise deployment. AppStore is the most widely available way to distribute, but there are other ways.<br></p><p>I always assumed that the reason we couldn’t use OSS toolchains in Playgrounds before was because of API changes in the hooks between Xcode and Swift/SourceKit/whatever is responsible for Playgrounds. Seems strange that we can muck around with a Swift nightly and AppKit APIs, but not the (to many people) more familiar UIKit APIs.<br></p><p>Karl<br></p><p>&gt; On 14 Jun 2016, at 02:49, Shawn Erickson &lt;shawnce at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Those later platforms are &quot;curated&quot;, you can only deploy apps via the App Store.
