Allow both `private` and `fileprivate` at file scope despite the fact<br>that they have the same meaning.  This is more consistent in the sense that<br>we are not introducing a special case that arbitrarily prohibits an<br>otherwise valid access modifier.  It also means that nothing needs to<br>change for top level `private` declarations in existing code.<br></p><p>&gt;<br></p><p>&gt; 2. Prohibit `private` at file scope.  Given that it appears as if the<br>behavior of `private` at file scope may not be intuitive and is equivalent<br>to `fileprivate` it might be reasonable to just disallow it.  This would<br>result in more consistent *code* (even if there needs to be a special case<br>in the language).<br></p><p>&gt;<br></p><p>&gt; I don’t have a strong opinion on which option we choose.  But I do feel<br>strongly that the semantics of `private` need to properly respect the scope<br>in which the keyword is written and into which the associated declaration<br>is introduced (rather than the scope *inside* the declaration it is<br>attached to).<br></p><p>The way we are defining those makes `fileprivate` closer to `internal` than<br>to `private`:<br></p><p>* `fileprivate` and `internal` have a predefined scope level (the file, the<br>module)<br></p><p>* `private` has a scope level depending on where it is declared<br></p><p>It would be more consistent to:<br></p><p>a) either rename `fileprivate` to `fileinternal`<br></p><p>b) either scoping `internal` keyword explicitly with a naming like<br>`internal(module)`, `internal(file)`<br></p><p>With this in mind, I wouldn&#39;t choose solution 2 from *Matthew* (prohibiting<br>`private` at some scope level), I would choose solution 1, with room for<br>renaming `fileinternal` in the future.<br></p><p><br>-- Antoine Cœur<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160618/e616ae1f/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
