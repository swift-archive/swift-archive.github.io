Let’s go through it following the suggested questions.<br></p><p>What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>I am 100% in favor of doing this. I think Erica makes good points and clearly explains what the impact on existing code is. In my opinion this impact is not too big, because - as Erica suggests - I believe only people coming from languages that have the C-style for-loop use it and only when starting with Swift.<br>Now that ++ and — are gone, I think it is indeed a good time to get rid of this C-style for-loop as well.<br></p><p>Furthermore, Erica typed &quot;using familiar constants and control structures. The for-loop mimics C and limits the effort needed to master this control flow.”. But I think that people who come from a C-style language have enough skills to know how loops work and can easily adapt their code to the for-in syntax.<br></p><p>Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>Yes I think that this will make the language less “cluttered” and it will probably also make the language implementation easier.<br></p><p>Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>As already stated by others and by Erica, the C-style for-loop does not feel “Swifty” at all and removing it will thus be good for the direction of Swift.<br></p><p>If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>I can’t really think of another language I used from the top of my mind that did not have a C-style for-loop, sorry.<br></p><p>How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>I read the proposal thoroughly and also read other peoples remarks on it. Furthermore I did some digging in our code and found one spot where I used the C-style for loop, which I trivially rewrote to use ..&lt;<br></p><p>Conclusion<br>Get rid of it ;). Furthermore, great job to Erica for putting her time into this proposal :).<br></p><p>Regards,<br></p><p>Nicky<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151208/5a97d8c6/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
