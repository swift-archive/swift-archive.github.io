I wouldn&#39;t recommend following their example, since we actively want to change the layout of things they&#39;re hardcoding. What Chris was referring to was the &quot;remote mirror&quot; library, which is used to support the Xcode 8 memory debugger, and is also in the long-term what we want to migrate in-process reflection facilities like the Mirror type to. The `swift-reflection-test` and `swift-reflection-dump` tools in the Swift compiler codebase might help give you a sense of what&#39;s currently available:<br></p><p>https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/tools/swift-reflection-test<br>https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/master/tools/swift-reflection-dump<br></p><p>-Joe<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
