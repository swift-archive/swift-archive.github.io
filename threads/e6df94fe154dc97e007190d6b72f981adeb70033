From SE-0116:<br></p><p>&gt; The user model for this type would ideally align with our long-term goal of supporting Hashable existentials directly, so the type deserves some short-term compiler support to help us get there.<br></p><p><br>I read that as meaning that the interface should look as close as possible to what using a raw “Hashable” would look like, and that some short-term complier magic to achieve that would be acceptable. As far as that goes:<br></p><p>- unwrapping is functionally equivalent (upcasting from Any today, in the future from Hashable, but when upcasting all that matters is the destination type so NFC)<br>- wrapping is too verbose:<br></p><p>&gt; ///     let descriptions: [AnyHashable : Any] = [<br>&gt; ///         AnyHashable(&quot;😄&quot;): &quot;emoji&quot;,<br>&gt; ///         AnyHashable(42): &quot;an Int&quot;,<br>&gt; ///         AnyHashable(Int8(43)): &quot;an Int8&quot;,<br>&gt; ///         AnyHashable(Set([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;])): &quot;a set of strings&quot;<br>&gt; ///     ]<br></p><p>That would be a big regression in readability, IMO. Previously, you could declare those keys without the “AnyHashable” wrapper, and the bridging magic would turn Int -&gt; NSNumber because that’s the way to make an Int conform to NSObject. It should be possible to teach the compiler how to turn a Hashable in to an AnyHashable implicitly.<br></p><p>But yeah, if we can do an implicit conversion, it’s a 👍 from me<br></p><p>Karl<br></p><p>&gt; On 24 Jul 2016, at 00:26, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The review of &quot;SE-0131: Add AnyHashable to the standard library&quot; begins now and runs through July 25.
