I don&#39;t find the consistency arguments convincing. Consistency has to be defined in terms of observable behavior of the language; If a word is a &quot;keyword&quot; or not is an implementation detail of the compiler IMHO(!), so there should be no rule regarding case-ness of keywords.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>No, I&#39;d rather see progress on static/dynamic dispatch rules of protocol extensions, for example. Changing the case-ness of just two random language keywords doesn&#39;t have any influence on the ABI or the API or the semantics of the language.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Don&#39;t think so.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>ObjC has -willSetValueForKey: and -didSetValueForKey: . It&#39;s not the same, because willSet and didSet are not related to KVO. But using the same camelCase syntax for didSet and willSet feels more consistent to me. At least, the semantic distance between didSet and -didSetValueForKey: is less than the semantic distance between didSet and associatedtype. (I compare them because associatedtype is also a keyword, and it&#39;s all lowercase.)<br></p><p>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review?

The only real rationale here is &quot;other keywords that are compound words are all lowercase instead of camelCase&quot; (except for dynamicType). But that&#39;s not a very compelling argument. More generally, I think `willSet` and `didSet` just looks better, and I think this may be because they are different types of phrases entirely than associatedtype, typealias, and fallthrough (they&#39;re certainly classified differently grammatically; willSet and didSet are verb pharses, associatedtype is an adjective phrase, typealias is a noun modifier [which is like an adjective phrase], and fallthrough is a compound word with precedent in other languages). They&#39;re also companions to the `set` declaration. Since `set` is a distinct concept in its own right, `willSet` and `didSet` highlight the fact that they&#39;re modifiers on the word `set`. In fact, if we had a distinct `type` declaration, then I think I&#39;d want to change `associatedtype` into `associatedType`. The camel casing makes it more obvious that this is a variant on the root word, whereas all-lowercase implies that the entire conjoined phrase is a single standalone concept.<br></p><p>Also, as others have already pointed out, willSet and didSet will hopefully end up as property behaviors rather than language keywords, and in that case the stated rationale doesn&#39;t apply.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>No. The rationale for this can largely be summed up as aesthetic preference and it&#39;s pretty subjective.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Does bikeshedding syntax count as fitting with the feel and direction of Swift? ;)<br></p><p>&gt; 	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>I&#39;m having trouble thinking of a relevant language that uses phrases for keywords.

If we are less than, say, 95% sure, I don&#39;t think we should do this yet. Changing from `willSet` to `willset` in Swift 3.2 or Swift 4 has a much smaller cost than changing to `willset` in Swift 3 and then back to `willSet` in a future version; jerking users around like that is likely to upset them.<br></p><p>And I don&#39;t think we should be 95% sure that all future accessors will be all-lowercase, because I think making them all-lowercase would be a *very* dubious decision, for several reasons:<br></p><p>1) `willset` and `didset` are less readable than `willSet` and `didSet`.<br></p><p>2) It is likely that many user-defined accessors will be impacted even more severely by all-lowercasing than `willset` and `didset`. Try to parse out names like `willlock` or `xmlid` or `enqueueforreading`, compared to the mixed-case `willLock`, `xmlID`, and `enqueueForReading`, and you&#39;ll see what I mean.<br></p><p>3) User-defined accessors will not only be defined; they will also be called. And these calls will look very strange indeed, given their keyword-like capitalization.<br></p><p>4) Keywords are all-lowercase because they are so familiar, and so intrinsic to the language&#39;s grammar, that an experienced Swift developer does not really read them so much as recognize them. But `willSet` and `didSet` *do* need to be read, because they are very similar keywords (one-character length difference) which both appear in the same context. And user-defined accessors will need to be read even more, because their names will be arbitrary and quite possibly used infrequently. The requirements of an accessor name are simply different from a declaration like `associatedtype`.<br></p><p>5) Keywords are *also* all-lowercase because they are rare multi-word examples of a class of names which are typically short and single-word. For instance, `associatedtype` and `typealias` belong to a class of declaration keywords which include `let`, `var`, `func`, `subscript`, `init`, `deinit`, `class`, `struct`, `enum`, `protocol`, and `extension`, all single-word keywords. `fallthrough` belongs to the same class as `break`, `continue`, `return`, `throw`, and `try`, as well as arguably `if`, `else`, `guard`, `switch`, `case`, `where`, `while`, `repeat`, `for`, `do`, and `catch`, again all single-word keywords. By contrast, I doubt that very many accessors will be single-word; currently we have two single-word ones and two multi-word ones, and most examples of user-defined accessors I&#39;ve seen have been multi-word.<br></p><p>Because I think we should probably not adopt all-lowercase user-defined accessor names, and because I think it is *much* better to make this change later than to make it now and undo it later, I think we probably should defer this proposal until the property behavior design has solidified.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes, but *only* if we are certain that this is the direction we want accessors to take—and I don&#39;t think we should be that certain.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Maybe.
