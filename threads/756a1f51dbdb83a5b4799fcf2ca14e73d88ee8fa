After debugging this led me to conclude it seems to be a more fundamental issue, maybe with the compiler code generation, around exception handling wrt Linux. I’d be interested in some feedback / guidance on this - am happy to take ownership and see where I might get with it but have a lot of learning to do !<br></p><p>The initial issue I looked at was SR-1547 &lt;https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1547&gt; in Foundation but this I determined to be the same issue as SR-585 &lt;https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-585&gt;.<br></p><p>I’ve added some comments to these issues relating to my investigation. Anyone have any more insight into this issue or suggestions on where to look next ?<br></p><p>Thanks<br>Mark<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-corelibs-dev/attachments/20161114/756ae8fa/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
