My only hesitation is with the naming of the<br>&gt; method that Brent also called out:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ... snip ...<br>&gt;<br>&gt;                 func index(n: IndexDistance, stepsFrom i: Index) -&gt; Index<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         Oof, I am really not a fan of this name. `steps` is sort-of a label on<br>&gt;         the `n` parameter, but it&#39;s attached to `i`. <br>&gt;<br>&gt; Oof indeed! This is a very unusual method in the standard library, since we&#39;re<br>&gt; calling on one instance to perform an action on another. My problems with the<br>&gt; naming are twofold: <br>&gt;<br>&gt; (1) Collision with the index(of:) and index(where:) APIs<br>&gt; The existing methods are used for searching a collection, possibly finding a<br>&gt; matching index, possibly not. The new ones deterministically find an new index<br>&gt; at a prescribed distance, with important and slightly complicated preconditions.<br>&gt; These differences make the use and &quot;flavor&quot; of the two sets of methods distinct<br>&gt; enough that I think they should have different names.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (2) Arguments are reversed<br>&gt; I think the ideal API for this would be index.advanced(by: 5, in: c), but I<br>&gt; prefer keeping the index-moving implementation in the collection, not the index.<br>&gt; I would favor any naming for this method that puts the index before the<br>&gt; distance, keeping the overall shape of the advanced(by:) method. c.advance(i,<br>&gt; by: 4) would be my pick.<br></p><p>Dmitri, Max, and I just talked this over and we think you&#39;re right on<br>both counts.  Having these “index” overloads appear in completion lists<br>alongside the ones that are there for use as high-level algorithms seems<br>wrong.  Also, since the method either returns a modified version of the<br>index or modifies the index in place, the index argument is “more<br>primary” and should come first.  Here&#39;s what we came up with:<br></p><p>     let j = location(i, offsetBy: 5)<br></p><p>     formLocation(&amp;i, offsetBy: -2)<br></p><p>Feedback welcome.<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
