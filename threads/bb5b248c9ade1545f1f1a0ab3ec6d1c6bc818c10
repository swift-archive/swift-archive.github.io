This limits the current situation where people new to the language expect `while` behavior and expect termination rather than sequence filtering. Removing `where` from for-in loops benefits these new users, reduces cognitive burden for all users, and enhances readability and predictability.<br></p><p>I do not believe the same benefit would accrue in retiring `where` from `catch` clauses and `switch` statement cases. One can argue that there are inherent flaws in both situations: unlike generic constraints, nothing prevents semantic disjunction in their `where` clauses. That said, both measurably benefit from their `where` clauses in the current grammar:<br></p><p>case_item_list : pattern where_clause? | pattern where_clause? &#39;,&#39; case_item_list<br>catch_clause : &#39;catch&#39; pattern? where_clause? code_block<br></p><p>Case item lists allow comma-separated patterns in a single case statement. The only way to express a related Boolean assertion is through `where`.<br>Catch clauses do not allow multiple patterns but I cannot think of an improved way to associate an assertion than `where`.<br></p><p>-- E<br></p><p><br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160608/bb5b8c10/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Retiring `where` from for-in loops</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>June  8, 2016 at 08:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Upon accepting SE-0099, the core team is removing `where` clauses from condition clauses, writing &quot;the &#39;where&#39; keyword can be retired from its purpose as a boolean condition introducer.&quot; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Inspiried by Xiaodi Wu, I now propose removing `where` clauses from `for in` loops, where they are better expressed (and read) as guard conditions. <br></p><p>Do you propose to remove `for case` as well?

So you need to keep using sequence.lazy.filter({ return i %2 == 0 }), unless you&#39;re OK with giving up some performance, which a) adds boilerplate, b) not many people will remember to do.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve taken the time to run a test, going through milion numbers (several times) using:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; for i in arr { if i % 2 == 0 { continue } }<br>&gt;&gt; for i in arr where i % 2 == 0 { }<br>&gt;&gt; for i in arr.filter({ $0 % 2 == 0 }) { }<br>&gt;&gt; for i in arr.lazy.filter({ $0 % 2 == 0 }) { }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Results:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; - plain for loop with if-continue: 27.19 seconds (+1.76%)<br>&gt;&gt; - with where: 26.72 seconds (+0.00%)<br>&gt;&gt; - .filter: 44.73 seconds (+67.40%)<br>&gt;&gt; - .lazy.filter: 31.66 seconds (+18.48%)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Yes, 100 milion numbers is an extreme, but it demonstrates that any of the suggested expressions will be slower, mainly if the caller doesn&#39;t use .lazy (67% !!!). The only comparable solution is adding additional lines of code into the body of the for loop by adding an if statement.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Just to double-check, was this with optimizations on? Because -Onone numbers aren’t nearly as motivating, but I would expect -O to remove the loop entirely in the simple case.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Jordan<br>&gt; <br></p><p>See my latest post - included results with -Ofast.

In most or all other C-family<br>languages, for loop statements allow specification of conditions for<br>exiting the loop but not for filtering. Therefore, Swift&#39;s use of `where`<br>is unprecedented and needs to be learned anew by every user of Swift.<br></p><p>* The word &quot;where&quot; does not consistently imply `break` or `continue`. In<br>current Swift, `where` implies `break` in the context of a `while` loop and<br>`continue` in the context of a `for` loop. Some users intuitively guess the<br>correct meaning in each context, while others guess the wrong meaning.<br>Therefore, the only way to learn for sure what `where` means in any context<br>is to read the rulebook. That, by definition, means that this is<br>unintuitive.<br></p><p>* There are other ways to break from a loop or continue to the next<br>iteration without performance penalty. Nearly all of these serve more<br>general purposes than a `where` clause. Some of these (such as `if` or<br>`guard`) would already be familiar to a new user before they encounter<br>loops, assuming a typical order for learning a programming language. Many<br>of these (such as filtering methods on collections, or simply `if`) would<br>be familiar to a user of another C-family language. Therefore, the `where`<br>clause provides no independent utility, is not more discoverable than its<br>alternatives, and is not required for progressive disclosure of an<br>important facility to a learner (i.e. a simplified syntax for those who may<br>not be ready for the advanced concepts needed to use a more fully-featured<br>alternative).<br></p><p>Conclusion: the `where` clause is unprecedented, unintuitive, provides no<br>independent utility, is not more discoverable than alternatives, and is not<br>required for pedagogical reasons; however, it has been used incorrectly by<br>at least some users. Therefore, it is harmful and ought to be removed or<br>reformed.<br></p><p>I know there&#39;s a linguist on the list, maybe he could comment on whether or<br>&gt;&gt; not using &#39;where&#39; as a filter is proper or an abomination.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I do not think that because something is confusing to some, or at first,<br>&gt;&gt; that it warrant removal from the language.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It is a very bad sign if something is confusing at first, especially to a<br>&gt; significant proportion of users. It&#39;s true by definition that once you have<br>&gt; mastered something you are no longer confused by it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Again, where is this significant proportion of users? I don&#39;t mean to<br>&gt; hound you on this, but I am genuinely curious where this is all coming from.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>We were talking about the hypothetical something here and what the bar<br>should be for removal from the language. My response is that being<br>confusing at first sight *is* a legitimate consideration for removal from<br>the language. If something turns out to be a confusing way to describe a<br>straightforward concept, then the more widespread the confusion, the more<br>urgent its removal.<br></p><p><br>&gt; The burden of evidence is on the proposers of these ideas.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As has been stated on this list, education is a valid and important<br>&gt; consideration for Swift. If something is confusing rather than difficult<br>&gt; (and the *concept* of filtering a list is not at all a difficult concept),<br>&gt; and if the same underlying concept can already be invoked in alternative<br>&gt; and equivalent ways that are not confusing, then it&#39;s a no-brainer that the<br>&gt; confusing thing is harmful to the language and should be removed on that<br>&gt; basis alone.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What is clear to one person may be confusing to another. There is no<br>&gt; perfect syntax that will not make it confusing for some users.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ----<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I really think it is important to come armed with more information with<br>&gt; these proposals.

In most or all other C-family languages, for loop statements allow specification of conditions for exiting the loop but not for filtering. Therefore, Swift&#39;s use of `where` is unprecedented and needs to be learned anew by every user of Swift.<br></p><p>When was this decided? I distinctly remember some bloke under Craig Federighi’s hair saying that it was time to “move beyond” C and essentially ditch legacy conventions which no longer make sense.<br></p><p>As I understand it, Swift is a new language with new conventions. It is desirable to align as many of those as possible with existing conventions so as to be easily learned, but if you limit Swift to other languages conventions you deny it any identity. Did Python ask anybody’s opinion before dropping curly-braces? Did people learn whatever Perl is supposed to be? Look at C’s hieroglyphic for loops! <br></p><p>Realistically, “for … in … while” is not going to cause incredible confusion. Removing it would cause a lot of frustration. You can’t on the one hand say our users are comfortable with the axioms of C’s hieroglyphic loops, and on the other hand say “for x in y while&quot; is confusing.<br></p><p>&gt; Again, as I said, once you&#39;ve mastered something, by definition you find it not confusing. Why should we doom x% of new users to writing a loop incorrectly at least once when we don&#39;t have to?<br></p><p><br>Ah, but if you’re not “doomed” to failing once, how will you ever master anything? Nobody knew how to write a C for-loop until someone showed them (and even then…). Nobody is going to just open a REPL and start writing code, with zero prior understanding of what Swift syntax looks like.<br></p><p>&gt; * The word &quot;where&quot; does not consistently imply `break` or `continue`. In current Swift, `where` implies `break` in the context of a `while` loop and `continue` in the context of a `for` loop. Some users intuitively guess the correct meaning in each context, while others guess the wrong meaning. Therefore, the only way to learn for sure what `where` means in any context is to read the rulebook. That, by definition, means that this is unintuitive.<br></p><p>I didn’t even know while loops supported “where”. I can’t even imagine what that would look like, or how I would reason about one if I saw one. I Googled around a little bit and couldn’t find any examples. If they exist, sure, go ahead, get rid of them. Nobody will miss them. It definitely makes sense on ‘for’, though. Lots and lots of people will miss that; it’s a pretty well-known feature.<br></p><p>Also, after everything you said, it’s still not unintuitive. That is not how languages work at all. Languages spoken by human beings are always ambiguous to some extent, and we use context to determine which meaning is correct:<br></p><p>(Quote from https://research.googleblog.com/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html)<br>&gt; One of the main problems that makes parsing so challenging is that human languages show remarkable levels of ambiguity. It is not uncommon for moderate length sentences - say 20 or 30 words in length - to have hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of possible syntactic structures. A natural language parser must somehow search through all of these alternatives, and find the most plausible structure given the context. As a very simple example, the sentence &quot;Alice drove down the street in her car&quot; has at least two possible dependency parses:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The first corresponds to the (correct) interpretation where Alice is driving in her car; the second corresponds to the (absurd, but possible) interpretation where the street is located in her car. The ambiguity arises because the preposition “in&quot; can either modify drove or street; this example is an instance of what is called prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity. <br></p><p><br>Even algebra is not completely unambiguous - you need to use BODMAS rules to disambiguate potential meanings.<br>It’s this context which I think you’re missing when zooming in at the word “where”:<br></p><p>- The context that this is a variation of a ‘for x in y’ loop. We know that it loops through every item in ‘y&#39; and assigns it ‘x’. It is literally Section 2 of the &#39;Swift Tour&#39; - you learn how to assign a variable, and then you learn about the “for x in y” loop. Everybody should recognise it.<br>- The context that ‘x’ is the subject, so ‘where’ is clearly a condition for x to fulfill<br>- The context that ‘where’ occurs after ‘in’, so it follows the order in which its written: ‘for every x in y, where such-and-such is true, do …”<br>- The “for x in y” loop is a data-driven loop. It doesn’t even have a loop index. It is not like a C for loop and you shouldn’t expect to reason about it that way.<br></p><p>&gt; * There are other ways to break from a loop or continue to the next iteration without performance penalty. Nearly all of these serve more general purposes than a `where` clause. Some of these (such as `if` or `guard`) would already be familiar to a new user before they encounter loops, assuming a typical order for learning a programming language. Many of these (such as filtering methods on collections, or simply `if`) would be familiar to a user of another C-family language. Therefore, the `where` clause provides no independent utility, is not more discoverable than its alternatives, and is not required for progressive disclosure of an important facility to a learner (i.e. a simplified syntax for those who may not be ready for the advanced concepts needed to use a more fully-featured alternative).<br></p><p>You say the points in favour of removal are not handwavey, but I’m still not convinced. “There are other ways to go to where this shortcut goes” is not reasoning. And I’d definitely argue that it is more discoverable than the ‘guard’ statement. The guard statement is stone-dead last at the end of a massive “Control-Flow” page. I would guess that most first-time readers skip those topics for later.<br></p><p>&gt; The point here is that this is not a slippery slope. If `where` offered independent utility, then some confusion alone probably wouldn&#39;t be enough to justify removal, though it may justify some consideration for change.

Especially with an unfamiliar construct in a new language. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; If people find the new proposed syntax confusing, do we pull that too? At what point do we stop?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That is why I favored (1) removal of the confusing syntax altogether; and (2) this proposal, which involves aligning the confusing syntax with an existing syntax. In short, no new syntax to get confused about.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Yes, there&#39;s was maybe even less voices stating that it is not confusing, but which group is more vocal?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Maybe I have been recently corrupt by Solid SQL queries:<br>&gt;&gt; select * from PEOPLE_TABLE where AGE_FIELD = 100<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Or by my (likely) broken English:<br>&gt;&gt; The places where I had the most fun<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; But, to me, where can only suggest some filtering (thus tag to a for ..  in .., continue if not matching). <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I&#39;m glad that you find it very clear. I do as well. That does not mean it is clear to everyone.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I still have yet to see widespread confusion of this. A few people learning swift here or there, but once they learn the syntax...do they still find it confusing?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I expect some concrete data on stuff like this...especially with proposed syntax changes. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Without concrete examples, what would stop one from coming in here and waving their hands around to push *what they like* through?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Here&#39;s what&#39;s not handwavy:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Conclusion: the `where` clause is unprecedented, unintuitive, provides no independent utility, is not more discoverable than alternatives, and is not required for pedagogical reasons; however, it has been used incorrectly by at least some users. Therefore, it is harmful and ought to be removed or reformed.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I know there&#39;s a linguist on the list, maybe he could comment on whether or not using &#39;where&#39; as a filter is proper or an abomination.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I do not think that because something is confusing to some, or at first, that it warrant removal from the language.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; It is a very bad sign if something is confusing at first, especially to a significant proportion of users. It&#39;s true by definition that once you have mastered something you are no longer confused by it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Again, where is this significant proportion of users? I don&#39;t mean to hound you on this, but I am genuinely curious where this is all coming from.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We were talking about the hypothetical something here and what the bar should be for removal from the language. My response is that being confusing at first sight *is* a legitimate consideration for removal from the language. If something turns out to be a confusing way to describe a straightforward concept, then the more widespread the confusion, the more urgent its removal.<br>&gt;  <br>&gt; The burden of evidence is on the proposers of these ideas. <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; As has been stated on this list, education is a valid and important consideration for Swift. If something is confusing rather than difficult (and the *concept* of filtering a list is not at all a difficult concept), and if the same underlying concept can already be invoked in alternative and equivalent ways that are not confusing, then it&#39;s a no-brainer that the confusing thing is harmful to the language and should be removed on that basis alone.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What is clear to one person may be confusing to another. There is no perfect syntax that will not make it confusing for some users. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; ----<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I really think it is important to come armed with more information with these proposals. It&#39;s easy to say a significant proportion of people are confused but it would make me much more comfortable to see this data to back it up. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; What if we are spinning our wheels for no reason on a feature that *most* don&#39;t find confusing? What if we make a bigger proportion of those who did understand it more confused now?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;  <br>&gt; Brandon <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; By analogy, Chinese and Japanese share difficult writing systems. Yet many people use those languages daily without difficulty. Does that mean there&#39;s not a problem? Far from it: in fact, you&#39;ll find that many intelligent people have devoted their life&#39;s work to mitigating the issue. Both Chinese and Japanese underwent a round of simplification in the 20th century. Think about it: real languages used for daily life by a significant fraction of the world&#39;s population were revamped for the purpose of increasing accessibility to new learners.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The by-value/by-reference is well define, but can be confusing at first. Same goes for eager/lazy processing, or escaping vs non-escaping closure, or even the difference between closure and function. But no one suggest to remove them.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Value types vs. reference types is a concept (and a moderately advanced one), eager vs. lazy processing is a concept (and a moderately advanced one), and closures are a concept (and definitely an advanced one).<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Filtering a collection is a concept as well, and no one is suggesting its removal. We are proposing to simplify and rationalize the syntax by which filtering is invoked. If there were a way to dramatically simplify the syntax surrounding value types and reference types so as to diminish confusion, you can absolutely guarantee that there would be proposals to change the syntax. If I could think of one tomorrow, you&#39;d see a thread tomorrow about it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m that smart though.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Dany<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, the first of these proposals began with a question: how does one write arbitrary Boolean assertions after a let binding? The answer (use `where`) was found to be misleading and confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you&#39;re being unfair to say that these proposals have no purpose other than an academic consistency.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jun 9, 2016 at 13:29 Jon Shier via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         As time goes on, I’m feeling more and more that these consistency proposals are sorely misguided. Frankly, unless the syntax is confusing or misleading, even once the developer has learned the guiding principles of Swift, consistency is not a good argument for change. This proposal is the perfect example of this. No one will find the use of “where” in loops confusing, aside from those who will wonder why it was removed from if statements. There is no misleading behavior or confusing syntax here. This is just consistency for consistency’s sake. Once this proposal is done, then another will be made to remove “where” from another place in the language. Then another and another until it’s gone completely and a very useful part of the language is removed in the name of consistency. Which really just comes down to “where” isn’t used here, so it can’t be used there anymore.

I<br>&gt; don’t *c*laim to know the design rationale of all of these languages, but<br>&gt; I surmise that this is not an<br>&gt; a*c**c*ident: programmers move around and work in different languages,<br>&gt; and this allows a non-expert in the<br>&gt; language to understand what is going on. While there are things about *C*<br>&gt; that are really unfortunate IMO<br>&gt; (e.g. the de*c*larator/de*c*laration spe*c*ifier part of the grammar)<br>&gt; there is a lot of goodness in the basi<br>&gt; *c*operator set, fo*c*us on dot syntax, and more.<br>&gt; I do agree that there are some benefits to dit*c*hing bra*c*es and<br>&gt; relying on indentation instead, but there are<br>&gt; also downsides. Deviating from the *C* *family* in this respe*c*t would<br>&gt; have to provide **overwhelmingly** large<br>&gt; advantages for us to take su*c*h a plunge, and they simply don’t exist.<br></p><p><br></p><p>&gt; As I understand it, Swift is a new language with new conventions. It is<br>&gt; desirable to align as many of those as possible with existing conventions<br>&gt; so as to be easily learned, but if you limit Swift to other languages<br>&gt; conventions you deny it any identity. Did Python ask anybody’s opinion<br>&gt; before dropping curly-braces? Did people learn whatever Perl is supposed to<br>&gt; be? Look at C’s hieroglyphic for loops!<br>&gt;<br></p><p>I don&#39;t think we disagree here.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt; Realistically, “for … in … while” is not going to cause incredible<br>&gt; confusion. Removing it would cause a lot of frustration. You can’t on the<br>&gt; one hand say our users are comfortable with the axioms of C’s hieroglyphic<br>&gt; loops, and on the other hand say “for x in y while&quot; is confusing.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Again, as I said, once you&#39;ve mastered something, by definition you find<br>&gt; it not confusing. Why should we doom x% of new users to writing a loop<br>&gt; incorrectly at least once when we don&#39;t have to?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Ah, but if you’re not “doomed” to failing once, how will you ever master<br>&gt; anything? Nobody knew how to write a C for-loop until someone showed them<br>&gt; (and even then…). Nobody is going to just open a REPL and start writing<br>&gt; code, with zero prior understanding of what Swift syntax looks like.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>The thought here is along the lines of what Chris said, quoted above, and<br>repeated here: &quot;The extended C family of language [...] is an extremely<br>popular and widely used set[;] programmers move around and work in<br>different languages, and [aligning to expectations arising from other C<br>family languages] allows a non-expert in the language to understand what is<br>going on.&quot; By contrast, the `where` clause violates that expectation and I<br>do not see &quot;overwhelmingly large advantages&quot; for doing so.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt; * The word &quot;where&quot; does not consistently imply `break` or `continue`. In<br>&gt; current Swift, `where` implies `break` in the context of a `while` loop and<br>&gt; `continue` in the context of a `for` loop. Some users intuitively guess the<br>&gt; correct meaning in each context, while others guess the wrong meaning.<br>&gt; Therefore, the only way to learn for sure what `where` means in any context<br>&gt; is to read the rulebook. That, by definition, means that this is<br>&gt; unintuitive.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I didn’t even know while loops supported “where”. I can’t even imagine<br>&gt; what that would look like, or how I would reason about one if I saw one. I<br>&gt; Googled around a little bit and couldn’t find any examples. If they exist,<br>&gt; sure, go ahead, get rid of them. Nobody will miss them.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>Actually, we had a *huge* chain where there were definitely people who said<br>they would miss them, even though as you said it appears scarcely used and<br>not very well known. The pernicious problem with it was that it forced even<br>unrelated boolean assertions to be chained with `where`, as in:<br></p><p>```<br>while let x = iterator.next() where y &lt; z { ... }<br>```<br></p><p><br>&gt; It definitely makes sense on ‘for’, though. Lots and lots of people will<br>&gt; miss that; it’s a pretty well-known feature.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>(See Erica&#39;s statistics below.)<br></p><p>Also, after everything you said, it’s still not unintuitive. That is not<br>&gt; how languages work at all. Languages spoken by human beings are always<br>&gt; ambiguous to some extent, and we use context to determine which meaning is<br>&gt; correct:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (Quote from<br>&gt; https://research.googleblog.com/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html<br>&gt; )<br>&gt;<br>&gt; One of the main problems that makes parsing so challenging is that human<br>&gt; languages show remarkable levels of ambiguity. It is not uncommon for<br>&gt; moderate length sentences - say 20 or 30 words in length - to have<br>&gt; hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of possible<br>&gt; syntactic structures. A natural language parser must somehow search through<br>&gt; all of these alternatives, and find the most plausible structure given<br>&gt; the context. As a very simple example, the sentence &quot;Alice drove down the<br>&gt; street in her car&quot; has at least two possible dependency parses:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The first corresponds to the (correct) interpretation where Alice is<br>&gt; driving in her car; the second corresponds to the (absurd, but<br>&gt; possible) interpretation where the street is located in her car. The<br>&gt; ambiguity arises because the preposition “in&quot; can either<br>&gt; modify drove or street; this example is an instance of what is<br>&gt; called prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Even algebra is not completely unambiguous - you need to use BODMAS rules<br>&gt; to disambiguate potential meanings.<br>&gt; It’s this context which I think you’re missing when zooming in at the word<br>&gt; “where”:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - The context that this is a variation of a ‘for x in y’ loop. We know<br>&gt; that it loops through every item in ‘y&#39; and assigns it ‘x’. It is literally<br>&gt; Section 2 of the &#39;Swift Tour&#39; - you learn how to assign a variable, and<br>&gt; then you learn about the “for x in y” loop. Everybody should recognise it.<br>&gt; - The context that ‘x’ is the subject, so ‘where’ is clearly a condition<br>&gt; for x to fulfill<br>&gt; - The context that ‘where’ occurs after ‘in’, so it follows the order in<br>&gt; which its written: ‘for every x in y, where such-and-such is true, do …”<br>&gt; - The “for x in y” loop is a data-driven loop. It doesn’t even have a loop<br>&gt; index. It is not like a C for loop and you shouldn’t expect to reason about<br>&gt; it that way.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; * There are other ways to break from a loop or continue to the next<br>&gt; iteration without performance penalty. Nearly all of these serve more<br>&gt; general purposes than a `where` clause. Some of these (such as `if` or<br>&gt; `guard`) would already be familiar to a new user before they encounter<br>&gt; loops, assuming a typical order for learning a programming language. Many<br>&gt; of these (such as filtering methods on collections, or simply `if`) would<br>&gt; be familiar to a user of another C-family language. Therefore, the `where`<br>&gt; clause provides no independent utility, is not more discoverable than its<br>&gt; alternatives, and is not required for progressive disclosure of an<br>&gt; important facility to a learner (i.e. a simplified syntax for those who may<br>&gt; not be ready for the advanced concepts needed to use a more fully-featured<br>&gt; alternative).<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You say the points in favour of removal are not handwavey, but I’m still<br>&gt; not convinced. “There are other ways to go to where this shortcut goes” is<br>&gt; not reasoning. And I’d definitely argue that it is more discoverable than<br>&gt; the ‘guard’ statement. The guard statement is stone-dead last at the end of<br>&gt; a massive “Control-Flow” page. I would guess that most first-time readers<br>&gt; skip those topics for later.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>You cannot say the same about `if`.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt; The point here is that this is not a slippery slope. If `where` offered<br>&gt; independent utility, then some confusion alone probably wouldn&#39;t be enough<br>&gt; to justify removal, though it may justify some consideration for change.<br>&gt; However, as the extensive discussion has shown, there is nothing `where`<br>&gt; can do that something else can&#39;t do better. I know you like it for style,<br>&gt; but that&#39;s not sufficient grounds for keeping something confusing, IMO.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It’s more readable.

Therefore, it is harmful and ought to be removed or<br>&gt; reformed.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I know there&#39;s a linguist on the list, maybe he could comment on whether<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; or not using &#39;where&#39; as a filter is proper or an abomination.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I do not think that because something is confusing to some, or at first,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; that it warrant removal from the language.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; It is a very bad sign if something is confusing at first, especially to a<br>&gt;&gt; significant proportion of users. It&#39;s true by definition that once you have<br>&gt;&gt; mastered something you are no longer confused by it.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Again, where is this significant proportion of users? I don&#39;t mean to<br>&gt;&gt; hound you on this, but I am genuinely curious where this is all coming from.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; We were talking about the hypothetical something here and what the bar<br>&gt; should be for removal from the language. My response is that being<br>&gt; confusing at first sight *is* a legitimate consideration for removal from<br>&gt; the language. If something turns out to be a confusing way to describe a<br>&gt; straightforward concept, then the more widespread the confusion, the more<br>&gt; urgent its removal.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The burden of evidence is on the proposers of these ideas.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; As has been stated on this list, education is a valid and important<br>&gt;&gt; consideration for Swift. If something is confusing rather than difficult<br>&gt;&gt; (and the *concept* of filtering a list is not at all a difficult concept),<br>&gt;&gt; and if the same underlying concept can already be invoked in alternative<br>&gt;&gt; and equivalent ways that are not confusing, then it&#39;s a no-brainer that the<br>&gt;&gt; confusing thing is harmful to the language and should be removed on that<br>&gt;&gt; basis alone.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; What is clear to one person may be confusing to another. There is no<br>&gt;&gt; perfect syntax that will not make it confusing for some users.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ----<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I really think it is important to come armed with more information with<br>&gt;&gt; these proposals. It&#39;s easy to say a significant proportion of people are<br>&gt;&gt; confused but it would make me much more comfortable to see this data to<br>&gt;&gt; back it up.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; What if we are spinning our wheels for no reason on a feature that *most*<br>&gt;&gt; don&#39;t find confusing? What if we make a bigger proportion of those who did<br>&gt;&gt; understand it more confused now?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Brandon<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; By analogy, Chinese and Japanese share difficult writing systems. Yet<br>&gt;&gt; many people use those languages daily without difficulty. Does that mean<br>&gt;&gt; there&#39;s not a problem? Far from it: in fact, you&#39;ll find that many<br>&gt;&gt; intelligent people have devoted their life&#39;s work to mitigating the issue.<br>&gt;&gt; Both Chinese and Japanese underwent a round of simplification in the 20th<br>&gt;&gt; century. Think about it: real languages used for daily life by a<br>&gt;&gt; significant fraction of the world&#39;s population were revamped for the<br>&gt;&gt; purpose of increasing accessibility to new learners.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The by-value/by-reference is well define, but can be confusing at first.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Same goes for eager/lazy processing, or escaping vs non-escaping closure,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; or even the difference between closure and function. But no one suggest to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; remove them.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Value types vs. reference types is a concept (and a moderately advanced<br>&gt;&gt; one), eager vs. lazy processing is a concept (and a moderately advanced<br>&gt;&gt; one), and closures are a concept (and definitely an advanced one).<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Filtering a collection is a concept as well, and no one is suggesting its<br>&gt;&gt; removal. We are proposing to simplify and rationalize the syntax by which<br>&gt;&gt; filtering is invoked. If there were a way to dramatically simplify the<br>&gt;&gt; syntax surrounding value types and reference types so as to diminish<br>&gt;&gt; confusion, you can absolutely guarantee that there would be proposals to<br>&gt;&gt; change the syntax. If I could think of one tomorrow, you&#39;d see a thread<br>&gt;&gt; tomorrow about it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m that smart though.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Dany<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, the first of these proposals began with a question: how does<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; one write arbitrary Boolean assertions after a let binding? The answer (use<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; `where`) was found to be misleading and confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you&#39;re being unfair to say that these proposals have no purpose<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; other than an academic consistency.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jun 9, 2016 at 13:29 Jon Shier via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         As time goes on, I’m feeling more and more that these<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consistency proposals are sorely misguided.

Therefore, Swift&#39;s use of `where` is unprecedented and needs to be learned anew by every user of Swift.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; When was this decided? I distinctly remember some bloke under Craig Federighi’s hair saying that it was time to “move beyond” C and essentially ditch legacy conventions which no longer make sense.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I think you misunderstood my argument here. I don&#39;t mean that we should yoke ourselves to C conventions, and we should absolutely ditch C convention when it doesn&#39;t make sense. The big-picture argument here is that `where` doesn&#39;t pass the bar of correcting a C convention that no longer makes sense.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; FWIW, on the topic of syntax choices, here is what Chris Lattner had to say on this list:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Kevin got it exactly right, but I’d expand that last bit a bit to:<br>&gt;&gt; “… picking the one that is most familiar to programmers in the extended C family is a good idea.[&quot;]<br>&gt;&gt; The extended C family of language (which includes C, C++, ObjC, but also C#, Java, Javascript, and more) is<br>&gt;&gt; an extremely popular and widely used set of languages that have a lot of surface-level similarity. I<br>&gt;&gt; don’t claim to know the design rationale of all of these languages, but I surmise that this is not an<br>&gt;&gt; accident: programmers move around and work in different languages, and this allows a non-expert in the<br>&gt;&gt; language to understand what is going on. While there are things about C that are really unfortunate IMO<br>&gt;&gt; (e.g. the declarator/declaration specifier part of the grammar) there is a lot of goodness in the basic<br>&gt;&gt; operator set, focus on dot syntax, and more.<br>&gt;&gt; I do agree that there are some benefits to ditching braces and relying on indentation instead, but there are<br>&gt;&gt; also downsides. Deviating from the C family in this respect would have to provide *overwhelmingly* large <br>&gt;&gt; advantages for us to take such a plunge, and they simply don’t exist.<br>&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt; As I understand it, Swift is a new language with new conventions. It is desirable to align as many of those as possible with existing conventions so as to be easily learned, but if you limit Swift to other languages conventions you deny it any identity. Did Python ask anybody’s opinion before dropping curly-braces? Did people learn whatever Perl is supposed to be? Look at C’s hieroglyphic for loops! <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I don&#39;t think we disagree here.<br>&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Realistically, “for … in … while” is not going to cause incredible confusion. Removing it would cause a lot of frustration. You can’t on the one hand say our users are comfortable with the axioms of C’s hieroglyphic loops, and on the other hand say “for x in y while&quot; is confusing.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, as I said, once you&#39;ve mastered something, by definition you find it not confusing. Why should we doom x% of new users to writing a loop incorrectly at least once when we don&#39;t have to?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Ah, but if you’re not “doomed” to failing once, how will you ever master anything? Nobody knew how to write a C for-loop until someone showed them (and even then…). Nobody is going to just open a REPL and start writing code, with zero prior understanding of what Swift syntax looks like.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The thought here is along the lines of what Chris said, quoted above, and repeated here: &quot;The extended C family of language [...] is an extremely popular and widely used set[;] programmers move around and work in different languages, and [aligning to expectations arising from other C family languages] allows a non-expert in the language to understand what is going on.&quot; By contrast, the `where` clause violates that expectation and I do not see &quot;overwhelmingly large advantages&quot; for doing so.<br></p><p>What about C#&#39;s `where` then? As C# is a member of the C family languages `where` is not violating expectations!<br></p><p>-Thorsten <br></p><p><br>&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * The word &quot;where&quot; does not consistently imply `break` or `continue`. In current Swift, `where` implies `break` in the context of a `while` loop and `continue` in the context of a `for` loop. Some users intuitively guess the correct meaning in each context, while others guess the wrong meaning. Therefore, the only way to learn for sure what `where` means in any context is to read the rulebook. That, by definition, means that this is unintuitive.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I didn’t even know while loops supported “where”. I can’t even imagine what that would look like, or how I would reason about one if I saw one. I Googled around a little bit and couldn’t find any examples. If they exist, sure, go ahead, get rid of them. Nobody will miss them.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Actually, we had a *huge* chain where there were definitely people who said they would miss them, even though as you said it appears scarcely used and not very well known. The pernicious problem with it was that it forced even unrelated boolean assertions to be chained with `where`, as in:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ```<br>&gt; while let x = iterator.next() where y &lt; z { ... }<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt; It definitely makes sense on ‘for’, though. Lots and lots of people will miss that; it’s a pretty well-known feature.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; (See Erica&#39;s statistics below.) <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Also, after everything you said, it’s still not unintuitive. That is not how languages work at all. Languages spoken by human beings are always ambiguous to some extent, and we use context to determine which meaning is correct:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; (Quote from https://research.googleblog.com/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; One of the main problems that makes parsing so challenging is that human languages show remarkable levels of ambiguity. It is not uncommon for moderate length sentences - say 20 or 30 words in length - to have hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of possible syntactic structures. A natural language parser must somehow search through all of these alternatives, and find the most plausible structure given the context. As a very simple example, the sentence &quot;Alice drove down the street in her car&quot; has at least two possible dependency parses:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The first corresponds to the (correct) interpretation where Alice is driving in her car; the second corresponds to the (absurd, but possible) interpretation where the street is located in her car. The ambiguity arises because the preposition “in&quot; can either modify drove or street; this example is an instance of what is called prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Even algebra is not completely unambiguous - you need to use BODMAS rules to disambiguate potential meanings.<br>&gt;&gt; It’s this context which I think you’re missing when zooming in at the word “where”:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; - The context that this is a variation of a ‘for x in y’ loop. We know that it loops through every item in ‘y&#39; and assigns it ‘x’. It is literally Section 2 of the &#39;Swift Tour&#39; - you learn how to assign a variable, and then you learn about the “for x in y” loop. Everybody should recognise it.<br>&gt;&gt; - The context that ‘x’ is the subject, so ‘where’ is clearly a condition for x to fulfill<br>&gt;&gt; - The context that ‘where’ occurs after ‘in’, so it follows the order in which its written: ‘for every x in y, where such-and-such is true, do …”<br>&gt;&gt; - The “for x in y” loop is a data-driven loop. It doesn’t even have a loop index. It is not like a C for loop and you shouldn’t expect to reason about it that way.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * There are other ways to break from a loop or continue to the next iteration without performance penalty. Nearly all of these serve more general purposes than a `where` clause. Some of these (such as `if` or `guard`) would already be familiar to a new user before they encounter loops, assuming a typical order for learning a programming language. Many of these (such as filtering methods on collections, or simply `if`) would be familiar to a user of another C-family language. Therefore, the `where` clause provides no independent utility, is not more discoverable than its alternatives, and is not required for progressive disclosure of an important facility to a learner (i.e. a simplified syntax for those who may not be ready for the advanced concepts needed to use a more fully-featured alternative).<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; You say the points in favour of removal are not handwavey, but I’m still not convinced. “There are other ways to go to where this shortcut goes” is not reasoning. And I’d definitely argue that it is more discoverable than the ‘guard’ statement. The guard statement is stone-dead last at the end of a massive “Control-Flow” page. I would guess that most first-time readers skip those topics for later.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; You cannot say the same about `if`.<br>&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The point here is that this is not a slippery slope. If `where` offered independent utility, then some confusion alone probably wouldn&#39;t be enough to justify removal, though it may justify some consideration for change. However, as the extensive discussion has shown, there is nothing `where` can do that something else can&#39;t do better. I know you like it for style, but that&#39;s not sufficient grounds for keeping something confusing, IMO.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; It’s more readable. It does that better.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Earlier in this thread and others, I gave my reasoning where I disagree with this assertion about being more readable.<br>&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt; The tests also seem to show that (bizarrely) it’s also slightly faster than the alternatives.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I don&#39;t believe there has been any demonstration that it&#39;s faster than `guard` or `if`. I would be shocked if that were the case.<br>&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Karl<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On 10 Jun 2016, at 08:25, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, Jun 10, 2016 at 12:48 AM, Brandon Knope &lt;bknope at me.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 10, 2016, at 1:08 AM, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jun 9, 2016 at 9:45 PM, Dany St-Amant &lt;dsa.mls at icloud.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Le 9 juin 2016 à 14:55, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There have been, in previous threads, several examples given where users of Swift have found the behavior of `where` to be misleading and confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry Xiaodi, but beside you (on multiple instances), and recently Erica, I have do not recall hearing that many voices saying that &#39;where&#39; is confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shawn Erickson wrote this to the list just yesterday:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;I support your position on the use of where and while/when being confusing in the loop statement.

After the fact that made sense to me but it didn&#39;t click at first.&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Couldn&#39;t we find examples of anyone being confused at any syntax? Especially with an unfamiliar construct in a new language. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If people find the new proposed syntax confusing, do we pull that too? At what point do we stop?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; That is why I favored (1) removal of the confusing syntax altogether; and (2) this proposal, which involves aligning the confusing syntax with an existing syntax. In short, no new syntax to get confused about.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, there&#39;s was maybe even less voices stating that it is not confusing, but which group is more vocal?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe I have been recently corrupt by Solid SQL queries:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; select * from PEOPLE_TABLE where AGE_FIELD = 100<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or by my (likely) broken English:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The places where I had the most fun<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But, to me, where can only suggest some filtering (thus tag to a for ..  in .., continue if not matching). <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m glad that you find it very clear. I do as well. That does not mean it is clear to everyone.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I still have yet to see widespread confusion of this. A few people learning swift here or there, but once they learn the syntax...do they still find it confusing?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I expect some concrete data on stuff like this...especially with proposed syntax changes. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Without concrete examples, what would stop one from coming in here and waving their hands around to push *what they like* through?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s what&#39;s not handwavy:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Conclusion: the `where` clause is unprecedented, unintuitive, provides no independent utility, is not more discoverable than alternatives, and is not required for pedagogical reasons; however, it has been used incorrectly by at least some users. Therefore, it is harmful and ought to be removed or reformed.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know there&#39;s a linguist on the list, maybe he could comment on whether or not using &#39;where&#39; as a filter is proper or an abomination.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do not think that because something is confusing to some, or at first, that it warrant removal from the language.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a very bad sign if something is confusing at first, especially to a significant proportion of users. It&#39;s true by definition that once you have mastered something you are no longer confused by it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, where is this significant proportion of users? I don&#39;t mean to hound you on this, but I am genuinely curious where this is all coming from.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; We were talking about the hypothetical something here and what the bar should be for removal from the language. My response is that being confusing at first sight *is* a legitimate consideration for removal from the language. If something turns out to be a confusing way to describe a straightforward concept, then the more widespread the confusion, the more urgent its removal.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The burden of evidence is on the proposers of these ideas. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As has been stated on this list, education is a valid and important consideration for Swift. If something is confusing rather than difficult (and the *concept* of filtering a list is not at all a difficult concept), and if the same underlying concept can already be invoked in alternative and equivalent ways that are not confusing, then it&#39;s a no-brainer that the confusing thing is harmful to the language and should be removed on that basis alone.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What is clear to one person may be confusing to another. There is no perfect syntax that will not make it confusing for some users. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ----<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I really think it is important to come armed with more information with these proposals. It&#39;s easy to say a significant proportion of people are confused but it would make me much more comfortable to see this data to back it up. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What if we are spinning our wheels for no reason on a feature that *most* don&#39;t find confusing? What if we make a bigger proportion of those who did understand it more confused now?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brandon <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By analogy, Chinese and Japanese share difficult writing systems. Yet many people use those languages daily without difficulty. Does that mean there&#39;s not a problem? Far from it: in fact, you&#39;ll find that many intelligent people have devoted their life&#39;s work to mitigating the issue. Both Chinese and Japanese underwent a round of simplification in the 20th century. Think about it: real languages used for daily life by a significant fraction of the world&#39;s population were revamped for the purpose of increasing accessibility to new learners.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The by-value/by-reference is well define, but can be confusing at first. Same goes for eager/lazy processing, or escaping vs non-escaping closure, or even the difference between closure and function. But no one suggest to remove them.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Value types vs. reference types is a concept (and a moderately advanced one), eager vs. lazy processing is a concept (and a moderately advanced one), and closures are a concept (and definitely an advanced one).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Filtering a collection is a concept as well, and no one is suggesting its removal. We are proposing to simplify and rationalize the syntax by which filtering is invoked. If there were a way to dramatically simplify the syntax surrounding value types and reference types so as to diminish confusion, you can absolutely guarantee that there would be proposals to change the syntax. If I could think of one tomorrow, you&#39;d see a thread tomorrow about it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m that smart though.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dany<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, the first of these proposals began with a question: how does one write arbitrary Boolean assertions after a let binding? The answer (use `where`) was found to be misleading and confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you&#39;re being unfair to say that these proposals have no purpose other than an academic consistency.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jun 9, 2016 at 13:29 Jon Shier via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         As time goes on, I’m feeling more and more that these consistency proposals are sorely misguided. Frankly, unless the syntax is confusing or misleading, even once the developer has learned the guiding principles of Swift, consistency is not a good argument for change. This proposal is the perfect example of this. No one will find the use of “where” in loops confusing, aside from those who will wonder why it was removed from if statements. There is no misleading behavior or confusing syntax here. This is just consistency for consistency’s sake. Once this proposal is done, then another will be made to remove “where” from another place in the language. Then another and another until it’s gone completely and a very useful part of the language is removed in the name of consistency. Which really just comes down to “where” isn’t used here, so it can’t be used there anymore.

I don&#39;t mean that we should<br>&gt; yoke ourselves to C conventions, and we should absolutely ditch C<br>&gt; convention when it doesn&#39;t make sense. The big-picture argument here is<br>&gt; that `where` doesn&#39;t pass the bar of correcting a C convention that no<br>&gt; longer makes sense.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; FWIW, on the topic of syntax choices, here is what Chris Lattner had to<br>&gt; say on this list:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Kevin got it exa*c*tly right, but I’d expand that last bit a bit to:<br>&gt;&gt; “… pi*c*king the one that is most familiar to programmers in the<br>&gt;&gt; extended *C* *family* is a good idea.[&quot;]<br>&gt;&gt; The extended *C* *family* of language (whi*c*h in*c*ludes *C*, *C*++, Obj<br>&gt;&gt; *C*, but also *C*#, Java, Javas*c*ript, and more) is<br>&gt;&gt; an extremely popular and widely used set of languages that have a lot of<br>&gt;&gt; surfa*c*e-level similarity. I<br>&gt;&gt; don’t *c*laim to know the design rationale of all of these languages,<br>&gt;&gt; but I surmise that this is not an<br>&gt;&gt; a*c**c*ident: programmers move around and work in different languages,<br>&gt;&gt; and this allows a non-expert in the<br>&gt;&gt; language to understand what is going on. While there are things about *C*<br>&gt;&gt; that are really unfortunate IMO<br>&gt;&gt; (e.g. the de*c*larator/de*c*laration spe*c*ifier part of the grammar)<br>&gt;&gt; there is a lot of goodness in the basi<br>&gt;&gt; *c*operator set, fo*c*us on dot syntax, and more.<br>&gt;&gt; I do agree that there are some benefits to dit*c*hing bra*c*es and<br>&gt;&gt; relying on indentation instead, but there are<br>&gt;&gt; also downsides. Deviating from the *C* *family* in this respe*c*t would<br>&gt;&gt; have to provide **overwhelmingly** large<br>&gt;&gt; advantages for us to take su*c*h a plunge, and they simply don’t exist.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; As I understand it, Swift is a new language with new conventions. It is<br>&gt;&gt; desirable to align as many of those as possible with existing conventions<br>&gt;&gt; so as to be easily learned, but if you limit Swift to other languages<br>&gt;&gt; conventions you deny it any identity. Did Python ask anybody’s opinion<br>&gt;&gt; before dropping curly-braces? Did people learn whatever Perl is supposed to<br>&gt;&gt; be? Look at C’s hieroglyphic for loops!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I don&#39;t think we disagree here.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Realistically, “for … in … while” is not going to cause incredible<br>&gt;&gt; confusion. Removing it would cause a lot of frustration. You can’t on the<br>&gt;&gt; one hand say our users are comfortable with the axioms of C’s hieroglyphic<br>&gt;&gt; loops, and on the other hand say “for x in y while&quot; is confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Again, as I said, once you&#39;ve mastered something, by definition you find<br>&gt;&gt; it not confusing. Why should we doom x% of new users to writing a loop<br>&gt;&gt; incorrectly at least once when we don&#39;t have to?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Ah, but if you’re not “doomed” to failing once, how will you ever master<br>&gt;&gt; anything? Nobody knew how to write a C for-loop until someone showed them<br>&gt;&gt; (and even then…). Nobody is going to just open a REPL and start writing<br>&gt;&gt; code, with zero prior understanding of what Swift syntax looks like.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The thought here is along the lines of what Chris said, quoted above, and<br>&gt; repeated here: &quot;The extended C family of language [...] is an extremely<br>&gt; popular and widely used set[;] programmers move around and work in<br>&gt; different languages, and [aligning to expectations arising from other C<br>&gt; family languages] allows a non-expert in the language to understand what is<br>&gt; going on.&quot; By contrast, the `where` clause violates that expectation and I<br>&gt; do not see &quot;overwhelmingly large advantages&quot; for doing so.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What about C#&#39;s `where` then? As C# is a member of the C family languages<br>&gt; `where` is not violating expectations!<br>&gt;<br></p><p>C# does not have a where keyword for its foreach loop, afaik.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt; -Thorsten<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; * The word &quot;where&quot; does not consistently imply `break` or `continue`. In<br>&gt;&gt; current Swift, `where` implies `break` in the context of a `while` loop and<br>&gt;&gt; `continue` in the context of a `for` loop. Some users intuitively guess the<br>&gt;&gt; correct meaning in each context, while others guess the wrong meaning.<br>&gt;&gt; Therefore, the only way to learn for sure what `where` means in any context<br>&gt;&gt; is to read the rulebook. That, by definition, means that this is<br>&gt;&gt; unintuitive.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I didn’t even know while loops supported “where”. I can’t even imagine<br>&gt;&gt; what that would look like, or how I would reason about one if I saw one. I<br>&gt;&gt; Googled around a little bit and couldn’t find any examples. If they exist,<br>&gt;&gt; sure, go ahead, get rid of them. Nobody will miss them.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Actually, we had a *huge* chain where there were definitely people who<br>&gt; said they would miss them, even though as you said it appears scarcely used<br>&gt; and not very well known. The pernicious problem with it was that it forced<br>&gt; even unrelated boolean assertions to be chained with `where`, as in:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt; while let x = iterator.next() where y &lt; z { ... }<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; It definitely makes sense on ‘for’, though. Lots and lots of people will<br>&gt;&gt; miss that; it’s a pretty well-known feature.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (See Erica&#39;s statistics below.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Also, after everything you said, it’s still not unintuitive. That is not<br>&gt;&gt; how languages work at all. Languages spoken by human beings are always<br>&gt;&gt; ambiguous to some extent, and we use context to determine which meaning is<br>&gt;&gt; correct:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; (Quote from<br>&gt;&gt; https://research.googleblog.com/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html<br>&gt;&gt; )<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; One of the main problems that makes parsing so challenging is that human<br>&gt;&gt; languages show remarkable levels of ambiguity. It is not uncommon for<br>&gt;&gt; moderate length sentences - say 20 or 30 words in length - to have<br>&gt;&gt; hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of possible<br>&gt;&gt; syntactic structures. A natural language parser must somehow search through<br>&gt;&gt; all of these alternatives, and find the most plausible structure given<br>&gt;&gt; the context. As a very simple example, the sentence &quot;Alice drove down the<br>&gt;&gt; street in her car&quot; has at least two possible dependency parses:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The first corresponds to the (correct) interpretation where Alice is<br>&gt;&gt; driving in her car; the second corresponds to the (absurd, but<br>&gt;&gt; possible) interpretation where the street is located in her car. The<br>&gt;&gt; ambiguity arises because the preposition “in&quot; can either<br>&gt;&gt; modify drove or street; this example is an instance of what is<br>&gt;&gt; called prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Even algebra is not completely unambiguous - you need to use BODMAS rules<br>&gt;&gt; to disambiguate potential meanings.<br>&gt;&gt; It’s this context which I think you’re missing when zooming in at the<br>&gt;&gt; word “where”:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; - The context that this is a variation of a ‘for x in y’ loop. We know<br>&gt;&gt; that it loops through every item in ‘y&#39; and assigns it ‘x’. It is literally<br>&gt;&gt; Section 2 of the &#39;Swift Tour&#39; - you learn how to assign a variable, and<br>&gt;&gt; then you learn about the “for x in y” loop. Everybody should recognise it.<br>&gt;&gt; - The context that ‘x’ is the subject, so ‘where’ is clearly a condition<br>&gt;&gt; for x to fulfill<br>&gt;&gt; - The context that ‘where’ occurs after ‘in’, so it follows the order in<br>&gt;&gt; which its written: ‘for every x in y, where such-and-such is true, do …”<br>&gt;&gt; - The “for x in y” loop is a data-driven loop. It doesn’t even have a<br>&gt;&gt; loop index. It is not like a C for loop and you shouldn’t expect to reason<br>&gt;&gt; about it that way.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; * There are other ways to break from a loop or continue to the next<br>&gt;&gt; iteration without performance penalty. Nearly all of these serve more<br>&gt;&gt; general purposes than a `where` clause. Some of these (such as `if` or<br>&gt;&gt; `guard`) would already be familiar to a new user before they encounter<br>&gt;&gt; loops, assuming a typical order for learning a programming language. Many<br>&gt;&gt; of these (such as filtering methods on collections, or simply `if`) would<br>&gt;&gt; be familiar to a user of another C-family language. Therefore, the `where`<br>&gt;&gt; clause provides no independent utility, is not more discoverable than its<br>&gt;&gt; alternatives, and is not required for progressive disclosure of an<br>&gt;&gt; important facility to a learner (i.e. a simplified syntax for those who may<br>&gt;&gt; not be ready for the advanced concepts needed to use a more fully-featured<br>&gt;&gt; alternative).<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; You say the points in favour of removal are not handwavey, but I’m still<br>&gt;&gt; not convinced. “There are other ways to go to where this shortcut goes” is<br>&gt;&gt; not reasoning. And I’d definitely argue that it is more discoverable than<br>&gt;&gt; the ‘guard’ statement. The guard statement is stone-dead last at the end of<br>&gt;&gt; a massive “Control-Flow” page. I would guess that most first-time readers<br>&gt;&gt; skip those topics for later.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You cannot say the same about `if`.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The point here is that this is not a slippery slope. If `where` offered<br>&gt;&gt; independent utility, then some confusion alone probably wouldn&#39;t be enough<br>&gt;&gt; to justify removal, though it may justify some consideration for change.<br>&gt;&gt; However, as the extensive discussion has shown, there is nothing `where`<br>&gt;&gt; can do that something else can&#39;t do better. I know you like it for style,<br>&gt;&gt; but that&#39;s not sufficient grounds for keeping something confusing, IMO.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; It’s more readable. It does that better.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Earlier in this thread and others, I gave my reasoning where I disagree<br>&gt; with this assertion about being more readable.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The tests also seem to show that (bizarrely) it’s also slightly faster<br>&gt;&gt; than the alternatives.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I don&#39;t believe there has been any demonstration that it&#39;s faster than<br>&gt; `guard` or `if`. I would be shocked if that were the case.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Karl<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; On 10 Jun 2016, at 08:25, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; On Fri, Jun 10, 2016 at 12:48 AM, Brandon Knope &lt;bknope at me.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 10, 2016, at 1:08 AM, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jun 9, 2016 at 9:45 PM, Dany St-Amant &lt;dsa.mls at icloud.com&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Le 9 juin 2016 à 14:55, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There have been, in previous threads, several examples given where<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; users of Swift have found the behavior of `where` to be misleading and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry Xiaodi, but beside you (on multiple instances), and recently<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Erica, I have do not recall hearing that many voices saying that &#39;where&#39; is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Shawn Erickson wrote this to the list just yesterday:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;I support your position on the use of where and while/when being<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; confusing in the loop statement.

In short, no new syntax to get confused about.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Yes, there&#39;s was maybe even less voices stating that it is not confusing,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but which group is more vocal?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe I have been recently corrupt by Solid SQL queries:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; select * from PEOPLE_TABLE where AGE_FIELD = 100<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or by my (likely) broken English:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The places where I had the most fun<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But, to me, where can only suggest some filtering (thus tag to a for ..<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  in .., continue if not matching).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m glad that you find it very clear. I do as well. That does not mean<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; it is clear to everyone.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I still have yet to see widespread confusion of this. A few people<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; learning swift here or there, but once they learn the syntax...do they<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; still find it confusing?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I expect some concrete data on stuff like this...especially with proposed<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; syntax changes.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Without concrete examples, what would stop one from coming in here and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; waving their hands around to push *what they like* through?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s what&#39;s not handwavy:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Conclusion: the `where` clause is unprecedented, unintuitive, provides no<br>&gt;&gt; independent utility, is not more discoverable than alternatives, and is not<br>&gt;&gt; required for pedagogical reasons; however, it has been used incorrectly by<br>&gt;&gt; at least some users. Therefore, it is harmful and ought to be removed or<br>&gt;&gt; reformed.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I know there&#39;s a linguist on the list, maybe he could comment on whether<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or not using &#39;where&#39; as a filter is proper or an abomination.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do not think that because something is confusing to some, or at<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; first, that it warrant removal from the language.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a very bad sign if something is confusing at first, especially to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; a significant proportion of users. It&#39;s true by definition that once you<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; have mastered something you are no longer confused by it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, where is this significant proportion of users? I don&#39;t mean to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; hound you on this, but I am genuinely curious where this is all coming from.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; We were talking about the hypothetical something here and what the bar<br>&gt;&gt; should be for removal from the language. My response is that being<br>&gt;&gt; confusing at first sight *is* a legitimate consideration for removal from<br>&gt;&gt; the language. If something turns out to be a confusing way to describe a<br>&gt;&gt; straightforward concept, then the more widespread the confusion, the more<br>&gt;&gt; urgent its removal.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The burden of evidence is on the proposers of these ideas.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; As has been stated on this list, education is a valid and important<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; consideration for Swift. If something is confusing rather than difficult<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (and the *concept* of filtering a list is not at all a difficult concept),<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; and if the same underlying concept can already be invoked in alternative<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; and equivalent ways that are not confusing, then it&#39;s a no-brainer that the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; confusing thing is harmful to the language and should be removed on that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; basis alone.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; What is clear to one person may be confusing to another. There is no<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; perfect syntax that will not make it confusing for some users.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ----<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I really think it is important to come armed with more information with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; these proposals. It&#39;s easy to say a significant proportion of people are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; confused but it would make me much more comfortable to see this data to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; back it up.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; What if we are spinning our wheels for no reason on a feature that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; *most* don&#39;t find confusing? What if we make a bigger proportion of those<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; who did understand it more confused now?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Brandon<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; By analogy, Chinese and Japanese share difficult writing systems. Yet<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; many people use those languages daily without difficulty. Does that mean<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; there&#39;s not a problem? Far from it: in fact, you&#39;ll find that many<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; intelligent people have devoted their life&#39;s work to mitigating the issue.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Both Chinese and Japanese underwent a round of simplification in the 20th<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; century. Think about it: real languages used for daily life by a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; significant fraction of the world&#39;s population were revamped for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; purpose of increasing accessibility to new learners.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The by-value/by-reference is well define, but can be confusing at first.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Same goes for eager/lazy processing, or escaping vs non-escaping closure,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or even the difference between closure and function. But no one suggest to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; remove them.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Value types vs. reference types is a concept (and a moderately advanced<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; one), eager vs. lazy processing is a concept (and a moderately advanced<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; one), and closures are a concept (and definitely an advanced one).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Filtering a collection is a concept as well, and no one is suggesting<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; its removal. We are proposing to simplify and rationalize the syntax by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; which filtering is invoked. If there were a way to dramatically simplify<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; the syntax surrounding value types and reference types so as to diminish<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; confusion, you can absolutely guarantee that there would be proposals to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; change the syntax. If I could think of one tomorrow, you&#39;d see a thread<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; tomorrow about it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m that smart though.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dany<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, the first of these proposals began with a question: how does<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one write arbitrary Boolean assertions after a let binding? The answer (use<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `where`) was found to be misleading and confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you&#39;re being unfair to say that these proposals have no purpose<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other than an academic consistency.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jun 9, 2016 at 13:29 Jon Shier via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         As time goes on, I’m feeling more and more that these<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consistency proposals are sorely misguided. Frankly, unless the syntax is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; confusing or misleading, even once the developer has learned the guiding<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; principles of Swift, consistency is not a good argument for change. This<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; proposal is the perfect example of this. No one will find the use of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “where” in loops confusing, aside from those who will wonder why it was<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; removed from if statements. There is no misleading behavior or confusing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; syntax here. This is just consistency for consistency’s sake. Once this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; proposal is done, then another will be made to remove “where” from another<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; place in the language. Then another and another until it’s gone completely<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and a very useful part of the language is removed in the name of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consistency.

In most or all other C-family languages, for loop statements allow specification of conditions for exiting the loop but not for filtering. Therefore, Swift&#39;s use of `where` is unprecedented and needs to be learned anew by every user of Swift.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When was this decided? I distinctly remember some bloke under Craig Federighi’s hair saying that it was time to “move beyond” C and essentially ditch legacy conventions which no longer make sense.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you misunderstood my argument here. I don&#39;t mean that we should yoke ourselves to C conventions, and we should absolutely ditch C convention when it doesn&#39;t make sense. The big-picture argument here is that `where` doesn&#39;t pass the bar of correcting a C convention that no longer makes sense.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; FWIW, on the topic of syntax choices, here is what Chris Lattner had to say on this list:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kevin got it exactly right, but I’d expand that last bit a bit to:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “… picking the one that is most familiar to programmers in the extended C family is a good idea.[&quot;]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The extended C family of language (which includes C, C++, ObjC, but also C#, Java, Javascript, and more) is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an extremely popular and widely used set of languages that have a lot of surface-level similarity. I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don’t claim to know the design rationale of all of these languages, but I surmise that this is not an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accident: programmers move around and work in different languages, and this allows a non-expert in the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; language to understand what is going on. While there are things about C that are really unfortunate IMO<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (e.g. the declarator/declaration specifier part of the grammar) there is a lot of goodness in the basic<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; operator set, focus on dot syntax, and more.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do agree that there are some benefits to ditching braces and relying on indentation instead, but there are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also downsides. Deviating from the C family in this respect would have to provide *overwhelmingly* large <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; advantages for us to take such a plunge, and they simply don’t exist.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As I understand it, Swift is a new language with new conventions. It is desirable to align as many of those as possible with existing conventions so as to be easily learned, but if you limit Swift to other languages conventions you deny it any identity. Did Python ask anybody’s opinion before dropping curly-braces? Did people learn whatever Perl is supposed to be? Look at C’s hieroglyphic for loops! <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think we disagree here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Realistically, “for … in … while” is not going to cause incredible confusion. Removing it would cause a lot of frustration. You can’t on the one hand say our users are comfortable with the axioms of C’s hieroglyphic loops, and on the other hand say “for x in y while&quot; is confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, as I said, once you&#39;ve mastered something, by definition you find it not confusing. Why should we doom x% of new users to writing a loop incorrectly at least once when we don&#39;t have to?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, but if you’re not “doomed” to failing once, how will you ever master anything? Nobody knew how to write a C for-loop until someone showed them (and even then…). Nobody is going to just open a REPL and start writing code, with zero prior understanding of what Swift syntax looks like.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The thought here is along the lines of what Chris said, quoted above, and repeated here: &quot;The extended C family of language [...] is an extremely popular and widely used set[;] programmers move around and work in different languages, and [aligning to expectations arising from other C family languages] allows a non-expert in the language to understand what is going on.&quot; By contrast, the `where` clause violates that expectation and I do not see &quot;overwhelmingly large advantages&quot; for doing so.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; What about C#&#39;s `where` then? As C# is a member of the C family languages `where` is not violating expectations!<br>&gt; <br>&gt; C# does not have a where keyword for its foreach loop, afaik.<br></p><p>--&gt; linq<br></p><p>&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; -Thorsten <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * The word &quot;where&quot; does not consistently imply `break` or `continue`. In current Swift, `where` implies `break` in the context of a `while` loop and `continue` in the context of a `for` loop. Some users intuitively guess the correct meaning in each context, while others guess the wrong meaning. Therefore, the only way to learn for sure what `where` means in any context is to read the rulebook. That, by definition, means that this is unintuitive.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn’t even know while loops supported “where”. I can’t even imagine what that would look like, or how I would reason about one if I saw one. I Googled around a little bit and couldn’t find any examples. If they exist, sure, go ahead, get rid of them. Nobody will miss them.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, we had a *huge* chain where there were definitely people who said they would miss them, even though as you said it appears scarcely used and not very well known. The pernicious problem with it was that it forced even unrelated boolean assertions to be chained with `where`, as in:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; while let x = iterator.next() where y &lt; z { ... }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It definitely makes sense on ‘for’, though. Lots and lots of people will miss that; it’s a pretty well-known feature.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (See Erica&#39;s statistics below.) <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, after everything you said, it’s still not unintuitive. That is not how languages work at all. Languages spoken by human beings are always ambiguous to some extent, and we use context to determine which meaning is correct:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Quote from https://research.googleblog.com/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One of the main problems that makes parsing so challenging is that human languages show remarkable levels of ambiguity. It is not uncommon for moderate length sentences - say 20 or 30 words in length - to have hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of possible syntactic structures. A natural language parser must somehow search through all of these alternatives, and find the most plausible structure given the context. As a very simple example, the sentence &quot;Alice drove down the street in her car&quot; has at least two possible dependency parses:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The first corresponds to the (correct) interpretation where Alice is driving in her car; the second corresponds to the (absurd, but possible) interpretation where the street is located in her car. The ambiguity arises because the preposition “in&quot; can either modify drove or street; this example is an instance of what is called prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Even algebra is not completely unambiguous - you need to use BODMAS rules to disambiguate potential meanings.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s this context which I think you’re missing when zooming in at the word “where”:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - The context that this is a variation of a ‘for x in y’ loop. We know that it loops through every item in ‘y&#39; and assigns it ‘x’. It is literally Section 2 of the &#39;Swift Tour&#39; - you learn how to assign a variable, and then you learn about the “for x in y” loop. Everybody should recognise it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - The context that ‘x’ is the subject, so ‘where’ is clearly a condition for x to fulfill<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - The context that ‘where’ occurs after ‘in’, so it follows the order in which its written: ‘for every x in y, where such-and-such is true, do …”<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - The “for x in y” loop is a data-driven loop. It doesn’t even have a loop index. It is not like a C for loop and you shouldn’t expect to reason about it that way.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * There are other ways to break from a loop or continue to the next iteration without performance penalty. Nearly all of these serve more general purposes than a `where` clause. Some of these (such as `if` or `guard`) would already be familiar to a new user before they encounter loops, assuming a typical order for learning a programming language. Many of these (such as filtering methods on collections, or simply `if`) would be familiar to a user of another C-family language. Therefore, the `where` clause provides no independent utility, is not more discoverable than its alternatives, and is not required for progressive disclosure of an important facility to a learner (i.e. a simplified syntax for those who may not be ready for the advanced concepts needed to use a more fully-featured alternative).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You say the points in favour of removal are not handwavey, but I’m still not convinced. “There are other ways to go to where this shortcut goes” is not reasoning. And I’d definitely argue that it is more discoverable than the ‘guard’ statement. The guard statement is stone-dead last at the end of a massive “Control-Flow” page. I would guess that most first-time readers skip those topics for later.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot say the same about `if`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The point here is that this is not a slippery slope. If `where` offered independent utility, then some confusion alone probably wouldn&#39;t be enough to justify removal, though it may justify some consideration for change. However, as the extensive discussion has shown, there is nothing `where` can do that something else can&#39;t do better. I know you like it for style, but that&#39;s not sufficient grounds for keeping something confusing, IMO.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s more readable. It does that better.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Earlier in this thread and others, I gave my reasoning where I disagree with this assertion about being more readable.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The tests also seem to show that (bizarrely) it’s also slightly faster than the alternatives.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t believe there has been any demonstration that it&#39;s faster than `guard` or `if`. I would be shocked if that were the case.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Karl<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On 10 Jun 2016, at 08:25, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, Jun 10, 2016 at 12:48 AM, Brandon Knope &lt;bknope at me.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 10, 2016, at 1:08 AM, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jun 9, 2016 at 9:45 PM, Dany St-Amant &lt;dsa.mls at icloud.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Le 9 juin 2016 à 14:55, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There have been, in previous threads, several examples given where users of Swift have found the behavior of `where` to be misleading and confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry Xiaodi, but beside you (on multiple instances), and recently Erica, I have do not recall hearing that many voices saying that &#39;where&#39; is confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shawn Erickson wrote this to the list just yesterday:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;I support your position on the use of where and while/when being confusing in the loop statement.

At what point do we stop?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is why I favored (1) removal of the confusing syntax altogether; and (2) this proposal, which involves aligning the confusing syntax with an existing syntax. In short, no new syntax to get confused about.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, there&#39;s was maybe even less voices stating that it is not confusing, but which group is more vocal?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe I have been recently corrupt by Solid SQL queries:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; select * from PEOPLE_TABLE where AGE_FIELD = 100<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or by my (likely) broken English:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The places where I had the most fun<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But, to me, where can only suggest some filtering (thus tag to a for ..  in .., continue if not matching). <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m glad that you find it very clear. I do as well. That does not mean it is clear to everyone.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I still have yet to see widespread confusion of this. A few people learning swift here or there, but once they learn the syntax...do they still find it confusing?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I expect some concrete data on stuff like this...especially with proposed syntax changes. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Without concrete examples, what would stop one from coming in here and waving their hands around to push *what they like* through?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s what&#39;s not handwavy:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Conclusion: the `where` clause is unprecedented, unintuitive, provides no independent utility, is not more discoverable than alternatives, and is not required for pedagogical reasons; however, it has been used incorrectly by at least some users. Therefore, it is harmful and ought to be removed or reformed.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know there&#39;s a linguist on the list, maybe he could comment on whether or not using &#39;where&#39; as a filter is proper or an abomination.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do not think that because something is confusing to some, or at first, that it warrant removal from the language.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a very bad sign if something is confusing at first, especially to a significant proportion of users. It&#39;s true by definition that once you have mastered something you are no longer confused by it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, where is this significant proportion of users? I don&#39;t mean to hound you on this, but I am genuinely curious where this is all coming from.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We were talking about the hypothetical something here and what the bar should be for removal from the language. My response is that being confusing at first sight *is* a legitimate consideration for removal from the language. If something turns out to be a confusing way to describe a straightforward concept, then the more widespread the confusion, the more urgent its removal.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The burden of evidence is on the proposers of these ideas. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As has been stated on this list, education is a valid and important consideration for Swift. If something is confusing rather than difficult (and the *concept* of filtering a list is not at all a difficult concept), and if the same underlying concept can already be invoked in alternative and equivalent ways that are not confusing, then it&#39;s a no-brainer that the confusing thing is harmful to the language and should be removed on that basis alone.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What is clear to one person may be confusing to another. There is no perfect syntax that will not make it confusing for some users. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ----<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I really think it is important to come armed with more information with these proposals. It&#39;s easy to say a significant proportion of people are confused but it would make me much more comfortable to see this data to back it up. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What if we are spinning our wheels for no reason on a feature that *most* don&#39;t find confusing? What if we make a bigger proportion of those who did understand it more confused now?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brandon <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By analogy, Chinese and Japanese share difficult writing systems. Yet many people use those languages daily without difficulty. Does that mean there&#39;s not a problem? Far from it: in fact, you&#39;ll find that many intelligent people have devoted their life&#39;s work to mitigating the issue. Both Chinese and Japanese underwent a round of simplification in the 20th century. Think about it: real languages used for daily life by a significant fraction of the world&#39;s population were revamped for the purpose of increasing accessibility to new learners.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The by-value/by-reference is well define, but can be confusing at first. Same goes for eager/lazy processing, or escaping vs non-escaping closure, or even the difference between closure and function. But no one suggest to remove them.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Value types vs. reference types is a concept (and a moderately advanced one), eager vs. lazy processing is a concept (and a moderately advanced one), and closures are a concept (and definitely an advanced one).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Filtering a collection is a concept as well, and no one is suggesting its removal. We are proposing to simplify and rationalize the syntax by which filtering is invoked. If there were a way to dramatically simplify the syntax surrounding value types and reference types so as to diminish confusion, you can absolutely guarantee that there would be proposals to change the syntax. If I could think of one tomorrow, you&#39;d see a thread tomorrow about it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m that smart though.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dany<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, the first of these proposals began with a question: how does one write arbitrary Boolean assertions after a let binding? The answer (use `where`) was found to be misleading and confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you&#39;re being unfair to say that these proposals have no purpose other than an academic consistency.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jun 9, 2016 at 13:29 Jon Shier via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         As time goes on, I’m feeling more and more that these consistency proposals are sorely misguided. Frankly, unless the syntax is confusing or misleading, even once the developer has learned the guiding principles of Swift, consistency is not a good argument for change. This proposal is the perfect example of this. No one will find the use of “where” in loops confusing, aside from those who will wonder why it was removed from if statements. There is no misleading behavior or confusing syntax here. This is just consistency for consistency’s sake. Once this proposal is done, then another will be made to remove “where” from another place in the language. Then another and another until it’s gone completely and a very useful part of the language is removed in the name of consistency. Which really just comes down to “where” isn’t used here, so it can’t be used there anymore.

I distinctly remember some bloke under Craig Federighi’s hair saying that it was time to “move beyond” C and essentially ditch legacy conventions which no longer make sense.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you misunderstood my argument here. I don&#39;t mean that we should yoke ourselves to C conventions, and we should absolutely ditch C convention when it doesn&#39;t make sense. The big-picture argument here is that `where` doesn&#39;t pass the bar of correcting a C convention that no longer makes sense.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; FWIW, on the topic of syntax choices, here is what Chris Lattner had to say on this list:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kevin got it exactly right, but I’d expand that last bit a bit to:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “… picking the one that is most familiar to programmers in the extended C family is a good idea.[&quot;]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The extended C family of language (which includes C, C++, ObjC, but also C#, Java, Javascript, and more) is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an extremely popular and widely used set of languages that have a lot of surface-level similarity. I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don’t claim to know the design rationale of all of these languages, but I surmise that this is not an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accident: programmers move around and work in different languages, and this allows a non-expert in the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; language to understand what is going on. While there are things about C that are really unfortunate IMO<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (e.g. the declarator/declaration specifier part of the grammar) there is a lot of goodness in the basic<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; operator set, focus on dot syntax, and more.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do agree that there are some benefits to ditching braces and relying on indentation instead, but there are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also downsides. Deviating from the C family in this respect would have to provide *overwhelmingly* large <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; advantages for us to take such a plunge, and they simply don’t exist.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As I understand it, Swift is a new language with new conventions. It is desirable to align as many of those as possible with existing conventions so as to be easily learned, but if you limit Swift to other languages conventions you deny it any identity. Did Python ask anybody’s opinion before dropping curly-braces? Did people learn whatever Perl is supposed to be? Look at C’s hieroglyphic for loops! <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think we disagree here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Realistically, “for … in … while” is not going to cause incredible confusion. Removing it would cause a lot of frustration. You can’t on the one hand say our users are comfortable with the axioms of C’s hieroglyphic loops, and on the other hand say “for x in y while&quot; is confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, as I said, once you&#39;ve mastered something, by definition you find it not confusing. Why should we doom x% of new users to writing a loop incorrectly at least once when we don&#39;t have to?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, but if you’re not “doomed” to failing once, how will you ever master anything?

Therefore, Swift&#39;s use of `where` is unprecedented and needs to be learned anew by every user of Swift.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; When was this decided? I distinctly remember some bloke under Craig Federighi’s hair saying that it was time to “move beyond” C and essentially ditch legacy conventions which no longer make sense.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I think you misunderstood my argument here. I don&#39;t mean that we should yoke ourselves to C conventions, and we should absolutely ditch C convention when it doesn&#39;t make sense. The big-picture argument here is that `where` doesn&#39;t pass the bar of correcting a C convention that no longer makes sense.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; FWIW, on the topic of syntax choices, here is what Chris Lattner had to say on this list:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Kevin got it exactly right, but I’d expand that last bit a bit to:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; “… picking the one that is most familiar to programmers in the extended C family is a good idea.[&quot;]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The extended C family of language (which includes C, C++, ObjC, but also C#, Java, Javascript, and more) is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; an extremely popular and widely used set of languages that have a lot of surface-level similarity. I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; don’t claim to know the design rationale of all of these languages, but I surmise that this is not an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; accident: programmers move around and work in different languages, and this allows a non-expert in the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; language to understand what is going on. While there are things about C that are really unfortunate IMO<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (e.g. the declarator/declaration specifier part of the grammar) there is a lot of goodness in the basic<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; operator set, focus on dot syntax, and more.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I do agree that there are some benefits to ditching braces and relying on indentation instead, but there are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; also downsides. Deviating from the C family in this respect would have to provide *overwhelmingly* large <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; advantages for us to take such a plunge, and they simply don’t exist.<br>&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; As I understand it, Swift is a new language with new conventions. It is desirable to align as many of those as possible with existing conventions so as to be easily learned, but if you limit Swift to other languages conventions you deny it any identity. Did Python ask anybody’s opinion before dropping curly-braces? Did people learn whatever Perl is supposed to be? Look at C’s hieroglyphic for loops! <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think we disagree here.<br>&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Realistically, “for … in … while” is not going to cause incredible confusion. Removing it would cause a lot of frustration. You can’t on the one hand say our users are comfortable with the axioms of C’s hieroglyphic loops, and on the other hand say “for x in y while&quot; is confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, as I said, once you&#39;ve mastered something, by definition you find it not confusing. Why should we doom x% of new users to writing a loop incorrectly at least once when we don&#39;t have to?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, but if you’re not “doomed” to failing once, how will you ever master anything?

In current Swift, `where` implies `break` in the context of a `while` loop and `continue` in the context of a `for` loop. Some users intuitively guess the correct meaning in each context, while others guess the wrong meaning. Therefore, the only way to learn for sure what `where` means in any context is to read the rulebook. That, by definition, means that this is unintuitive.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn’t even know while loops supported “where”. I can’t even imagine what that would look like, or how I would reason about one if I saw one. I Googled around a little bit and couldn’t find any examples. If they exist, sure, go ahead, get rid of them. Nobody will miss them.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Actually, we had a *huge* chain where there were definitely people who said they would miss them, even though as you said it appears scarcely used and not very well known. The pernicious problem with it was that it forced even unrelated boolean assertions to be chained with `where`, as in:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt; while let x = iterator.next() where y &lt; z { ... }<br>&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It definitely makes sense on ‘for’, though. Lots and lots of people will miss that; it’s a pretty well-known feature.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; (See Erica&#39;s statistics below.) <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, after everything you said, it’s still not unintuitive. That is not how languages work at all. Languages spoken by human beings are always ambiguous to some extent, and we use context to determine which meaning is correct:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (Quote from https://research.googleblog.com/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One of the main problems that makes parsing so challenging is that human languages show remarkable levels of ambiguity. It is not uncommon for moderate length sentences - say 20 or 30 words in length - to have hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of possible syntactic structures. A natural language parser must somehow search through all of these alternatives, and find the most plausible structure given the context. As a very simple example, the sentence &quot;Alice drove down the street in her car&quot; has at least two possible dependency parses:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The first corresponds to the (correct) interpretation where Alice is driving in her car; the second corresponds to the (absurd, but possible) interpretation where the street is located in her car. The ambiguity arises because the preposition “in&quot; can either modify drove or street; this example is an instance of what is called prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Even algebra is not completely unambiguous - you need to use BODMAS rules to disambiguate potential meanings.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s this context which I think you’re missing when zooming in at the word “where”:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - The context that this is a variation of a ‘for x in y’ loop. We know that it loops through every item in ‘y&#39; and assigns it ‘x’. It is literally Section 2 of the &#39;Swift Tour&#39; - you learn how to assign a variable, and then you learn about the “for x in y” loop. Everybody should recognise it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - The context that ‘x’ is the subject, so ‘where’ is clearly a condition for x to fulfill<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - The context that ‘where’ occurs after ‘in’, so it follows the order in which its written: ‘for every x in y, where such-and-such is true, do …”<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - The “for x in y” loop is a data-driven loop. It doesn’t even have a loop index. It is not like a C for loop and you shouldn’t expect to reason about it that way.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * There are other ways to break from a loop or continue to the next iteration without performance penalty. Nearly all of these serve more general purposes than a `where` clause. Some of these (such as `if` or `guard`) would already be familiar to a new user before they encounter loops, assuming a typical order for learning a programming language. Many of these (such as filtering methods on collections, or simply `if`) would be familiar to a user of another C-family language. Therefore, the `where` clause provides no independent utility, is not more discoverable than its alternatives, and is not required for progressive disclosure of an important facility to a learner (i.e. a simplified syntax for those who may not be ready for the advanced concepts needed to use a more fully-featured alternative).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; You say the points in favour of removal are not handwavey, but I’m still not convinced. “There are other ways to go to where this shortcut goes” is not reasoning. And I’d definitely argue that it is more discoverable than the ‘guard’ statement. The guard statement is stone-dead last at the end of a massive “Control-Flow” page. I would guess that most first-time readers skip those topics for later.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; You cannot say the same about `if`.<br>&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The point here is that this is not a slippery slope. If `where` offered independent utility, then some confusion alone probably wouldn&#39;t be enough to justify removal, though it may justify some consideration for change. However, as the extensive discussion has shown, there is nothing `where` can do that something else can&#39;t do better. I know you like it for style, but that&#39;s not sufficient grounds for keeping something confusing, IMO.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s more readable. It does that better.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Earlier in this thread and others, I gave my reasoning where I disagree with this assertion about being more readable.<br>&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The tests also seem to show that (bizarrely) it’s also slightly faster than the alternatives.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t believe there has been any demonstration that it&#39;s faster than `guard` or `if`. I would be shocked if that were the case.<br>&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Karl<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On 10 Jun 2016, at 08:25, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, Jun 10, 2016 at 12:48 AM, Brandon Knope &lt;bknope at me.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 10, 2016, at 1:08 AM, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jun 9, 2016 at 9:45 PM, Dany St-Amant &lt;dsa.mls at icloud.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Le 9 juin 2016 à 14:55, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There have been, in previous threads, several examples given where users of Swift have found the behavior of `where` to be misleading and confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry Xiaodi, but beside you (on multiple instances), and recently Erica, I have do not recall hearing that many voices saying that &#39;where&#39; is confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shawn Erickson wrote this to the list just yesterday:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;I support your position on the use of where and while/when being confusing in the loop statement.

After the fact that made sense to me but it didn&#39;t click at first.&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Couldn&#39;t we find examples of anyone being confused at any syntax? Especially with an unfamiliar construct in a new language. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If people find the new proposed syntax confusing, do we pull that too? At what point do we stop?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is why I favored (1) removal of the confusing syntax altogether; and (2) this proposal, which involves aligning the confusing syntax with an existing syntax. In short, no new syntax to get confused about.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, there&#39;s was maybe even less voices stating that it is not confusing, but which group is more vocal?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe I have been recently corrupt by Solid SQL queries:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; select * from PEOPLE_TABLE where AGE_FIELD = 100<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or by my (likely) broken English:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The places where I had the most fun<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But, to me, where can only suggest some filtering (thus tag to a for ..  in .., continue if not matching). <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m glad that you find it very clear. I do as well. That does not mean it is clear to everyone.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I still have yet to see widespread confusion of this. A few people learning swift here or there, but once they learn the syntax...do they still find it confusing?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I expect some concrete data on stuff like this...especially with proposed syntax changes. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Without concrete examples, what would stop one from coming in here and waving their hands around to push *what they like* through?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s what&#39;s not handwavy:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Conclusion: the `where` clause is unprecedented, unintuitive, provides no independent utility, is not more discoverable than alternatives, and is not required for pedagogical reasons; however, it has been used incorrectly by at least some users. Therefore, it is harmful and ought to be removed or reformed.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know there&#39;s a linguist on the list, maybe he could comment on whether or not using &#39;where&#39; as a filter is proper or an abomination.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do not think that because something is confusing to some, or at first, that it warrant removal from the language.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a very bad sign if something is confusing at first, especially to a significant proportion of users. It&#39;s true by definition that once you have mastered something you are no longer confused by it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, where is this significant proportion of users? I don&#39;t mean to hound you on this, but I am genuinely curious where this is all coming from.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We were talking about the hypothetical something here and what the bar should be for removal from the language. My response is that being confusing at first sight *is* a legitimate consideration for removal from the language. If something turns out to be a confusing way to describe a straightforward concept, then the more widespread the confusion, the more urgent its removal.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The burden of evidence is on the proposers of these ideas. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As has been stated on this list, education is a valid and important consideration for Swift. If something is confusing rather than difficult (and the *concept* of filtering a list is not at all a difficult concept), and if the same underlying concept can already be invoked in alternative and equivalent ways that are not confusing, then it&#39;s a no-brainer that the confusing thing is harmful to the language and should be removed on that basis alone.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What is clear to one person may be confusing to another. There is no perfect syntax that will not make it confusing for some users. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ----<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I really think it is important to come armed with more information with these proposals. It&#39;s easy to say a significant proportion of people are confused but it would make me much more comfortable to see this data to back it up. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What if we are spinning our wheels for no reason on a feature that *most* don&#39;t find confusing? What if we make a bigger proportion of those who did understand it more confused now?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brandon <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By analogy, Chinese and Japanese share difficult writing systems. Yet many people use those languages daily without difficulty. Does that mean there&#39;s not a problem? Far from it: in fact, you&#39;ll find that many intelligent people have devoted their life&#39;s work to mitigating the issue. Both Chinese and Japanese underwent a round of simplification in the 20th century. Think about it: real languages used for daily life by a significant fraction of the world&#39;s population were revamped for the purpose of increasing accessibility to new learners.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The by-value/by-reference is well define, but can be confusing at first. Same goes for eager/lazy processing, or escaping vs non-escaping closure, or even the difference between closure and function. But no one suggest to remove them.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Value types vs. reference types is a concept (and a moderately advanced one), eager vs. lazy processing is a concept (and a moderately advanced one), and closures are a concept (and definitely an advanced one).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Filtering a collection is a concept as well, and no one is suggesting its removal. We are proposing to simplify and rationalize the syntax by which filtering is invoked. If there were a way to dramatically simplify the syntax surrounding value types and reference types so as to diminish confusion, you can absolutely guarantee that there would be proposals to change the syntax. If I could think of one tomorrow, you&#39;d see a thread tomorrow about it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m that smart though.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dany<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, the first of these proposals began with a question: how does one write arbitrary Boolean assertions after a let binding? The answer (use `where`) was found to be misleading and confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you&#39;re being unfair to say that these proposals have no purpose other than an academic consistency.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jun 9, 2016 at 13:29 Jon Shier via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         As time goes on, I’m feeling more and more that these consistency proposals are sorely misguided. Frankly, unless the syntax is confusing or misleading, even once the developer has learned the guiding principles of Swift, consistency is not a good argument for change. This proposal is the perfect example of this. No one will find the use of “where” in loops confusing, aside from those who will wonder why it was removed from if statements. There is no misleading behavior or confusing syntax here. This is just consistency for consistency’s sake. Once this proposal is done, then another will be made to remove “where” from another place in the language. Then another and another until it’s gone completely and a very useful part of the language is removed in the name of consistency.

You can’t on the one hand say our users are comfortable with the axioms of C’s hieroglyphic loops, and on the other hand say “for x in y while&quot; is confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, as I said, once you&#39;ve mastered something, by definition you find it not confusing. Why should we doom x% of new users to writing a loop incorrectly at least once when we don&#39;t have to?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, but if you’re not “doomed” to failing once, how will you ever master anything? Nobody knew how to write a C for-loop until someone showed them (and even then…). Nobody is going to just open a REPL and start writing code, with zero prior understanding of what Swift syntax looks like.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The thought here is along the lines of what Chris said, quoted above, and repeated here: &quot;The extended C family of language [...] is an extremely popular and widely used set[;] programmers move around and work in different languages, and [aligning to expectations arising from other C family languages] allows a non-expert in the language to understand what is going on.&quot; By contrast, the `where` clause violates that expectation and I do not see &quot;overwhelmingly large advantages&quot; for doing so.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What about C#&#39;s `where` then? As C# is a member of the C family languages `where` is not violating expectations!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Where is not exactly a part of c# it belongs to linq<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; And that is not a part of C#??<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; SQL is a domain-specific language, and LINQ is an internal domain-specific language with a language extension for C#. Neither is a general purpose language.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Your example actually goes to one of Laurent&#39;s points. Should the Swift core team or an enterprising community member propose a set of similarly powerful tools, along with a set of language extensions that add syntactic sugar for them, I (and I think Laurent, if I understand him correctly) would absolutely be in favor of such an addition. But as it is, `where` is an odd duckling. Just as you say, it looks like a component of a query language, but it does no such thing. In a for loop, it does some filtering, but until recently it functioned like a comma in `while` loops. Look at those other keywords which make this sugar possible in C#: in your example, `from` and `select`. We don&#39;t have any of that intrastructure in Swift.<br>&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; IMHO the team has taken an Ockham Axe to the grammar: in the presence of multiple ways to produce the same or an acceptable stand-in (for eg when the only difference is an acceptable temporary perf setback), then the solution requiring the least assumptions on the compiler wins. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I would even extend this rule with the corollary that between an assumption materialized as a type checker rule and an assumption materialized as a full blown extra language keyword, there might be a bias to accept the former if it kills the latter. But this is just my personal inference of what their decision heuristic might be based solely on what I saw. My sole interest in trying to understand their decision making process is to try to avoid proposals that have little to no chance to go anywhere, as well as trying to present ones that will align better with where the language is going.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In this instance, WHERE is a heavy assumption on the compiler for no greater gain than filters can provide. So I think we save the WHERE keyword for an outcome that will be really worth it! Something along the idea of Linq, but with a proper Swift feel to it. What does it look like? I cannot say yet. But the good news is that having taken WHERE out now will make that next step a purely additive process (nothing will be taken out then, but a big thing will be gained). <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The following is an example from MSDN with `where` clearly beaing a keyword:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; var numQuery = from num in numbers where (num % 2) == 0 select num;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Here is food for your thoughts, you think WHERE is a keyword?! then look at this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; var numbers = new int[]{0,1,23,4,5,6,7,87,9};<br>&gt; var numQuery = from num in numbers where (num % 2) == 0 select num;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Program does not compile:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; // Error CS1935: An implementation of `Where&#39; query expression pattern could not be found. Are you missing `System.Linq&#39; using directive or `System.Core.dll&#39; assembly reference? (CS1935) (SessionsFinder)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; using System.Linq;<br>&gt; var numbers = new int[]{0,1,23,4,5,6,7,87,9};<br>&gt; var numQuery = from num in numbers where (num % 2) == 0 select num;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That program does compiles and runs fine. This tells you that “where&quot; is not at all the ordinary keyword that it appears to be. hence my “it is not C# per-se, it is Linq”. And if you still wonder, then rewrite the code so that “WHERE” no longer looks like a keyword:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; var numQuery2 = numbers.Where( num =&gt; num %2 == 0);	// exact same result as numQuery1<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; These are other real life examples from a OS X tool I wrote recently: <br>&gt; <br>&gt; IEnumerable&lt;Task&lt;Session&gt;&gt; asyncOps = from session in sessions.Values select parseSessionDetails(updater, parser, session);<br>&gt; var ul = node.Descendants().Where(x =&gt; x.Name == &quot;ul&quot;).First();<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160612/4643f8d9/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85a454a69ee2cf2ac4b990dc9e87b664?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Retiring `where` from for-in loops</strong> from <string>Thorsten Seitz</string> &lt;tseitz42 at icloud.com&gt;<p>June 12, 2016 at 03:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Am 12.06.2016 um 12:02 schrieb L Mihalkovic &lt;laurent.mihalkovic at gmail.com&gt;:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jun 11, 2016, at 11:45 PM, Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com &lt;mailto:xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Sat, Jun 11, 2016 at 3:37 PM, Thorsten Seitz &lt;tseitz42 at icloud.com &lt;mailto:tseitz42 at icloud.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Am 11.06.2016 um 22:29 schrieb L.

Neither is a general purpose language.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Your example actually goes to one of Laurent&#39;s points. Should the Swift core team or an enterprising community member propose a set of similarly powerful tools, along with a set of language extensions that add syntactic sugar for them, I (and I think Laurent, if I understand him correctly) would absolutely be in favor of such an addition. But as it is, `where` is an odd duckling. Just as you say, it looks like a component of a query language, but it does no such thing. In a for loop, it does some filtering, but until recently it functioned like a comma in `while` loops. Look at those other keywords which make this sugar possible in C#: in your example, `from` and `select`. We don&#39;t have any of that intrastructure in Swift.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; IMHO the team has taken an Ockham Axe to the grammar: in the presence of multiple ways to produce the same or an acceptable stand-in (for eg when the only difference is an acceptable temporary perf setback), then the solution requiring the least assumptions on the compiler wins. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I would even extend this rule with the corollary that between an assumption materialized as a type checker rule and an assumption materialized as a full blown extra language keyword, there might be a bias to accept the former if it kills the latter. But this is just my personal inference of what their decision heuristic might be based solely on what I saw. My sole interest in trying to understand their decision making process is to try to avoid proposals that have little to no chance to go anywhere, as well as trying to present ones that will align better with where the language is going.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; In this instance, WHERE is a heavy assumption on the compiler for no greater gain than filters can provide. So I think we save the WHERE keyword for an outcome that will be really worth it! Something along the idea of Linq, but with a proper Swift feel to it. What does it look like? I cannot say yet. But the good news is that having taken WHERE out now will make that next step a purely additive process (nothing will be taken out then, but a big thing will be gained). <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I am all for extending `for` to be more like Scala’s `for`-expression or Haskell’s `do`-notation. LINQ might be too focused on querying.<br>&gt; Extending the current `where` to be syntax sugar for `filter` would be quite straightforward, though, so I’m not sure whether removing it first is really necessary. <br>&gt; That was not object of the pitch to retire `where` from `for`-loops, though. Instead the argument was (and still is) that `where` might be misunderstood there by beginners and should therefore be removed. This argument would apply to an extended `where` unchanged, because I can still write the exact same code as being criticized now and can even do more complicated things which would by even more hard to understand for beginners.<br>&gt; That’s the argument I disagree with.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The following is an example from MSDN with `where` clearly beaing a keyword:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; var numQuery = from num in numbers where (num % 2) == 0 select num;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Here is food for your thoughts, you think WHERE is a keyword?! then look at this:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; var numbers = new int[]{0,1,23,4,5,6,7,87,9};<br>&gt;&gt; var numQuery = from num in numbers where (num % 2) == 0 select num;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Program does not compile:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; // Error CS1935: An implementation of `Where&#39; query expression pattern could not be found.

In most or all other C-family<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; languages, for loop statements allow specification of conditions for<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; exiting the loop but not for filtering. Therefore, Swift&#39;s use of `where`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; is unprecedented and needs to be learned anew by every user of Swift.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; When was this decided? I distinctly remember some bloke under Craig<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Federighi’s hair saying that it was time to “move beyond” C and essentially<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ditch legacy conventions which no longer make sense.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I think you misunderstood my argument here. I don&#39;t mean that we should<br>&gt;&gt; yoke ourselves to C conventions, and we should absolutely ditch C<br>&gt;&gt; convention when it doesn&#39;t make sense. The big-picture argument here is<br>&gt;&gt; that `where` doesn&#39;t pass the bar of correcting a C convention that no<br>&gt;&gt; longer makes sense.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; FWIW, on the topic of syntax choices, here is what Chris Lattner had to<br>&gt;&gt; say on this list:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Kevin got it exa*c*tly right, but I’d expand that last bit a bit to:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; “… pi*c*king the one that is most familiar to programmers in the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; extended *C* *family* is a good idea.[&quot;]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The extended *C* *family* of language (whi*c*h in*c*ludes *C*, *C*++,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Obj*C*, but also *C*#, Java, Javas*c*ript, and more) is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; an extremely popular and widely used set of languages that have a lot of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; surfa*c*e-level similarity. I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; don’t *c*laim to know the design rationale of all of these languages,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; but I surmise that this is not an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; a*c**c*ident: programmers move around and work in different languages,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; and this allows a non-expert in the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; language to understand what is going on. While there are things about<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; *C* that are really unfortunate IMO<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (e.g. the de*c*larator/de*c*laration spe*c*ifier part of the grammar)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; there is a lot of goodness in the basi<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; *c*operator set, fo*c*us on dot syntax, and more.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I do agree that there are some benefits to dit*c*hing bra*c*es and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; relying on indentation instead, but there are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; also downsides. Deviating from the *C* *family* in this respe*c*t would<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; have to provide **overwhelmingly** large<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; advantages for us to take su*c*h a plunge, and they simply don’t exist.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; As I understand it, Swift is a new language with new conventions. It is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; desirable to align as many of those as possible with existing conventions<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; so as to be easily learned, but if you limit Swift to other languages<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; conventions you deny it any identity. Did Python ask anybody’s opinion<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; before dropping curly-braces? Did people learn whatever Perl is supposed to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; be? Look at C’s hieroglyphic for loops!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think we disagree here.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Realistically, “for … in … while” is not going to cause incredible<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; confusion. Removing it would cause a lot of frustration. You can’t on the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; one hand say our users are comfortable with the axioms of C’s hieroglyphic<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; loops, and on the other hand say “for x in y while&quot; is confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, as I said, once you&#39;ve mastered something, by definition you find<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; it not confusing. Why should we doom x% of new users to writing a loop<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; incorrectly at least once when we don&#39;t have to?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, but if you’re not “doomed” to failing once, how will you ever master<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; anything? Nobody knew how to write a C for-loop until someone showed them<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (and even then…). Nobody is going to just open a REPL and start writing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; code, with zero prior understanding of what Swift syntax looks like.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The thought here is along the lines of what Chris said, quoted above, and<br>&gt;&gt; repeated here: &quot;The extended C family of language [...] is an extremely<br>&gt;&gt; popular and widely used set[;] programmers move around and work in<br>&gt;&gt; different languages, and [aligning to expectations arising from other C<br>&gt;&gt; family languages] allows a non-expert in the language to understand what is<br>&gt;&gt; going on.&quot; By contrast, the `where` clause violates that expectation and I<br>&gt;&gt; do not see &quot;overwhelmingly large advantages&quot; for doing so.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; What about C#&#39;s `where` then?

Especially with an unfamiliar construct in a new language. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; If people find the new proposed syntax confusing, do we pull that too? At what point do we stop?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That is why I favored (1) removal of the confusing syntax altogether; and (2) this proposal, which involves aligning the confusing syntax with an existing syntax. In short, no new syntax to get confused about.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Yes, there&#39;s was maybe even less voices stating that it is not confusing, but which group is more vocal?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Maybe I have been recently corrupt by Solid SQL queries:<br>&gt;&gt; select * from PEOPLE_TABLE where AGE_FIELD = 100<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Or by my (likely) broken English:<br>&gt;&gt; The places where I had the most fun<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; But, to me, where can only suggest some filtering (thus tag to a for ..  in .., continue if not matching). <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I&#39;m glad that you find it very clear. I do as well. That does not mean it is clear to everyone.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I still have yet to see widespread confusion of this. A few people learning swift here or there, but once they learn the syntax...do they still find it confusing?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Again, as I said, once you&#39;ve mastered something, by definition you find it not confusing. Why should we doom x% of new users to writing a loop incorrectly at least once when we don&#39;t have to?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I expect some concrete data on stuff like this...especially with proposed syntax changes. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Without concrete examples, what would stop one from coming in here and waving their hands around to push *what they like* through?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Here&#39;s what&#39;s not handwavy:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * Swift is explicitly a C-family language. In most or all other C-family languages, for loop statements allow specification of conditions for exiting the loop but not for filtering. Therefore, Swift&#39;s use of `where` is unprecedented and needs to be learned anew by every user of Swift.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * The word &quot;where&quot; does not consistently imply `break` or `continue`. In current Swift, `where` implies `break` in the context of a `while` loop and `continue` in the context of a `for` loop. Some users intuitively guess the correct meaning in each context, while others guess the wrong meaning. Therefore, the only way to learn for sure what `where` means in any context is to read the rulebook. That, by definition, means that this is unintuitive.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * There are other ways to break from a loop or continue to the next iteration without performance penalty. Nearly all of these serve more general purposes than a `where` clause. Some of these (such as `if` or `guard`) would already be familiar to a new user before they encounter loops, assuming a typical order for learning a programming language. Many of these (such as filtering methods on collections, or simply `if`) would be familiar to a user of another C-family language. Therefore, the `where` clause provides no independent utility, is not more discoverable than its alternatives, and is not required for progressive disclosure of an important facility to a learner (i.e. a simplified syntax for those who may not be ready for the advanced concepts needed to use a more fully-featured alternative).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Conclusion: the `where` clause is unprecedented, unintuitive, provides no independent utility, is not more discoverable than alternatives, and is not required for pedagogical reasons; however, it has been used incorrectly by at least some users. Therefore, it is harmful and ought to be removed or reformed.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I know there&#39;s a linguist on the list, maybe he could comment on whether or not using &#39;where&#39; as a filter is proper or an abomination.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I do not think that because something is confusing to some, or at first, that it warrant removal from the language.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; It is a very bad sign if something is confusing at first, especially to a significant proportion of users. It&#39;s true by definition that once you have mastered something you are no longer confused by it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Again, where is this significant proportion of users? I don&#39;t mean to hound you on this, but I am genuinely curious where this is all coming from.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We were talking about the hypothetical something here and what the bar should be for removal from the language. My response is that being confusing at first sight *is* a legitimate consideration for removal from the language. If something turns out to be a confusing way to describe a straightforward concept, then the more widespread the confusion, the more urgent its removal.<br>&gt;  <br>&gt; The burden of evidence is on the proposers of these ideas. <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; As has been stated on this list, education is a valid and important consideration for Swift. If something is confusing rather than difficult (and the *concept* of filtering a list is not at all a difficult concept), and if the same underlying concept can already be invoked in alternative and equivalent ways that are not confusing, then it&#39;s a no-brainer that the confusing thing is harmful to the language and should be removed on that basis alone.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What is clear to one person may be confusing to another. There is no perfect syntax that will not make it confusing for some users. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; ----<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I really think it is important to come armed with more information with these proposals. It&#39;s easy to say a significant proportion of people are confused but it would make me much more comfortable to see this data to back it up. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; What if we are spinning our wheels for no reason on a feature that *most* don&#39;t find confusing? What if we make a bigger proportion of those who did understand it more confused now?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The point here is that this is not a slippery slope. If `where` offered independent utility, then some confusion alone probably wouldn&#39;t be enough to justify removal, though it may justify some consideration for change. However, as the extensive discussion has shown, there is nothing `where` can do that something else can&#39;t do better. I know you like it for style, but that&#39;s not sufficient grounds for keeping something confusing, IMO.<br>&gt;  <br>&gt; Brandon <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; By analogy, Chinese and Japanese share difficult writing systems. Yet many people use those languages daily without difficulty. Does that mean there&#39;s not a problem? Far from it: in fact, you&#39;ll find that many intelligent people have devoted their life&#39;s work to mitigating the issue. Both Chinese and Japanese underwent a round of simplification in the 20th century. Think about it: real languages used for daily life by a significant fraction of the world&#39;s population were revamped for the purpose of increasing accessibility to new learners.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The by-value/by-reference is well define, but can be confusing at first. Same goes for eager/lazy processing, or escaping vs non-escaping closure, or even the difference between closure and function. But no one suggest to remove them.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Value types vs. reference types is a concept (and a moderately advanced one), eager vs. lazy processing is a concept (and a moderately advanced one), and closures are a concept (and definitely an advanced one).<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Filtering a collection is a concept as well, and no one is suggesting its removal. We are proposing to simplify and rationalize the syntax by which filtering is invoked. If there were a way to dramatically simplify the syntax surrounding value types and reference types so as to diminish confusion, you can absolutely guarantee that there would be proposals to change the syntax. If I could think of one tomorrow, you&#39;d see a thread tomorrow about it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m that smart though.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Dany<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, the first of these proposals began with a question: how does one write arbitrary Boolean assertions after a let binding? The answer (use `where`) was found to be misleading and confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you&#39;re being unfair to say that these proposals have no purpose other than an academic consistency.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jun 9, 2016 at 13:29 Jon Shier via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         As time goes on, I’m feeling more and more that these consistency proposals are sorely misguided. Frankly, unless the syntax is confusing or misleading, even once the developer has learned the guiding principles of Swift, consistency is not a good argument for change. This proposal is the perfect example of this. No one will find the use of “where” in loops confusing, aside from those who will wonder why it was removed from if statements. There is no misleading behavior or confusing syntax here. This is just consistency for consistency’s sake. Once this proposal is done, then another will be made to remove “where” from another place in the language. Then another and another until it’s gone completely and a very useful part of the language is removed in the name of consistency. Which really just comes down to “where” isn’t used here, so it can’t be used there anymore. It’s death by a thousand cuts.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Jon Shier<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; On Jun 9, 2016, at 1:16 PM, Erica Sadun via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; On Jun 9, 2016, at 11:11 AM, Charlie Monroe &lt;charlie at charliemonroe.net &lt;mailto:charlie at charliemonroe.net&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; See my latest post - included results with -Ofast.

This is a consideration, though by no means determinative of<br>what features we should have.<br></p><p>By contrast, there are elements of syntax in Swift which are<br>&#39;unprecedented.&#39; Some of those support features unique to Swift, or<br>features that Swift deliberately makes more prominent--take, for example,<br>sugar for unwrapping optionals or a greatly expanded type system.<br></p><p>We have heard from the core team that the `where` clause was put into the<br>language in order to align with greatly expanded pattern matching<br>facilities, but this was abandoned. Thus it now falls into a second<br>category of &#39;unprecedented&#39; syntax: a syntax with no parallels in other<br>languages that take inspiration from C, but which does not serve a purpose<br>that is unique to or uniquely emphasized in Swift.<br></p><p>Besides, the purpose of a for in loop is to iterate over elements in a<br>&gt; sequence, so filtering is very much a useful thing to do so it’s hardly<br>&gt; unprecedented, and it’s also a fairly common thing to want to do.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>That&#39;s not what I mean by precedent--see above.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt; * The word &quot;where&quot; does not consistently imply `break` or `continue`. In<br>&gt; current Swift, `where` implies `break` in the context of a `while` loop and<br>&gt; `continue` in the context of a `for` loop. Some users intuitively guess the<br>&gt; correct meaning in each context, while others guess the wrong meaning.<br>&gt; Therefore, the only way to learn for sure what `where` means in any context<br>&gt; is to read the rulebook. That, by definition, means that this is<br>&gt; unintuitive.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This is an argument for renaming the where keyword on for loops to be more<br>&gt; clear, or to somehow integrate continue/break to be more explicit about<br>&gt; what the developer intends for it to do.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>Sure: I conclude that the keyword should be *either* removed *or* reformed;<br>both outcomes could address the issue.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt; * There are other ways to break from a loop or continue to the next<br>&gt; iteration without performance penalty. Nearly all of these serve more<br>&gt; general purposes than a `where` clause.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This isn’t really an argument against the where clause; the where clause<br>&gt; is useful for common, simple cases, so it’s not surprising if more<br>&gt; complex/unusual cases can’t (or can’t easily) be handled by it. This is for<br>&gt; the simple cases where this isn’t an issue.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Some of these (such as `if` or `guard`) would already be familiar to a new<br>&gt; user before they encounter loops, assuming a typical order for learning a<br>&gt; programming language. Many of these (such as filtering methods on<br>&gt; collections, or simply `if`) would be familiar to a user of another<br>&gt; C-family language. Therefore, the `where` clause provides no independent<br>&gt; utility, is not more discoverable than its alternatives, and is not<br>&gt; required for progressive disclosure of an important facility to a learner<br>&gt; (i.e. a simplified syntax for those who may not be ready for the advanced<br>&gt; concepts needed to use a more fully-featured alternative).<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Simplification isn’t just for the new users; all you need to know with<br>&gt; where is that it’s a shorthand for guard X else { continue }, for many<br>&gt; people this is intuitive enough, but if there are enough for whom it isn’t<br>&gt; then again that’s an argument to tweak it to be more clear about what it<br>&gt; does, rather than remove it entirely.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The independent utility that it offers is being able to avoid if/guard<br>&gt; boilerplate at the start of your loop, but instead putting it on the same<br>&gt; line; in simple cases this can be nice and neat.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>That is not at all &#39;utility.&#39; It is tautologically true that if you have<br>two alternatives A and B, using A has the &#39;utility&#39; that you don&#39;t have to<br>use B. And since the whole point here is that the word `break` or<br>`continue` is not implied by `where`, I argue that writing it out within a<br>`guard` statement isn&#39;t boilerplate but absolutely essential. By contrast,<br>I have argued that the `where` syntax is not &#39;nice&#39; or &#39;neat.&#39;<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt; it has been used incorrectly by at least some users.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Every feature in every language &quot;has been used incorrectly by at least<br>&gt; some users&quot;, should we just drop all programming languages?<br>&gt;<br></p><p>Not every feature serves no independent purpose *and* is used incorrectly<br>by at least some users.<br></p><p><br>&gt; It’s not as if users can’t make mistakes while using an inline if/guard<br>&gt; condition.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>One that&#39;s not caught at compile time? Show me.<br></p><p><br>&gt; Again, this an argument that the meaning isn’t implicit enough, which is<br>&gt; just as well served by tweaking the syntax than removing it.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>Again, I&#39;d be happy tweaking the syntax to make it clear, if possible. If<br>not, I&#39;d remove it.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160610/1b17aee8/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5451f7df31d36d0159a018706aec7adb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Retiring `where` from for-in loops</strong> from <string>Erica Sadun</string> &lt;erica at ericasadun.com&gt;<p>June 10, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jun 10, 2016, at 8:02 AM, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Fri, Jun 10, 2016 at 7:18 AM, Haravikk &lt;swift-evolution at haravikk.me &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at haravikk.me&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; * The word &quot;where&quot; does not consistently imply `break` or `continue`.

Would you be able to share some examples where the `where` syntax provides a clear win in clarity? That would definitely be a huge pro, if it can be used to solve issues in expressiveness much like `guard` allowed elimination of the pyramid of doom.<br></p><p>I’d hate to lose `where` in for-in loops; I use it a lot. My own 2c on it is that I think if you look at isolated uses of `where` it’s not adding much clarity, but having it can allow you to adopt more-consistent patterns overall…which IMHO *does* result in clearer code.<br></p><p>I’ll provide two examples of such “consistent patterns” and how the presence of `for`-`in` `where` helps stick with them.<br></p><p>First Pattern: for some simple types I like to do data-driven unit tests — here’s a collection of values to test, here’s a basic, “algebraic&quot; property that should apply, test it actually does, and so on.<br></p><p>When I write a set of tests like that, I like to have a single variable holding the “instances to test” that is shared by all relevant tests; this lets me start with only a handful of values, confirm it seems to work, and then have a single place to edit once I’m ready to expand the values we test upon.<br></p><p>Such tests might wind up looking like this:<br></p><p>  func testNaiveAncestor() {<br>     // the root has no ancestor so we simply to skip it:<br>     for position in testPositions where !position.isRootPosition {<br>        XCTAssertLessThan(<br>         position.naiveAncestor(), <br>         position<br>        )<br>     }<br>  }<br></p><p>  func testNaiveSuccessor() {<br>     for position in testPositions {<br>        XCTAssertGreaterThan(<br>         position.naiveSuccessor(), <br>         position<br>        )<br>     }<br>  }<br></p><p>…where `testPositions` holds the values to test, and the two tests are each testing a basic algebraic property. Having `where` available on for-loops makes it possible to write these in such a way that the intended parallelism between the two is visually-apparent—you can tell they’re the same sort of thing just by looking at them—and it does so in a way that makes few assumptions on the type-or-contents of `testPositions`. <br></p><p>So `where` here, IMHO, isn’t *clearly* clearer in `testNaiveAncestor()`, but it lets `testNaiveAncestor()` and `testNaiveSuccessor()` (etc.) be *systemically*-clearer, as it were.<br></p><p>Second Pattern: relatedly, I find code is much clearer when `guard` is only-ever used for early exits and early returns. <br></p><p>There’s no requirement to *not* use `guard` and `continue` together, but if one is willing to stick to `guard` == “early exit / early return” it makes code much easier to read and audit.<br></p><p>In a handful of places I have for loops that would need both `continue`-style conditionals and also early-exit conditionals; having `where` means I can stick to using `guard` for early-exits, whereas without it I’d have extra nesting or mixed “early-exit” guard and “continue” guard. <br></p><p>This is as short as I can make it:<br></p><p>  /// Returns the portion of our frame that *might* be visible on-screen; doesn&#39;t<br>  /// handle occlusion, but unlike `approximateWindowRegion` will account for <br>  /// clipping done by our superviews.<br>  ///<br>  /// - note: `intersectionRegion(with view: UIView)` takes `self.bounds`, converts<br>  ///         it to `view`&#39;s coordinates, intersects with `view.bounds`, then converts<br>  ///         that back to `self`&#39;s coordinates...returning `nil` for any empty rects.<br>  ///<br>  @warn_unused_result<br>  public final func approximateVisibleRegion() -&gt; CGRect? {<br>    // before checking everything, confirm we *have a window* and that our<br>    // position vis-a-vis the window could *possibly* make sense<br>    // no window =&gt; not visible<br>    guard let w = self.window else {<br>      return nil<br>    }<br>    // empty &quot;frame-intersect-window&quot; =&gt; not visible<br>    guard let regionInWindow = self.intersectionRegion(with: w) else {<br>      return nil<br>    }<br>    <br>    // now we prepare to &quot;walk upstream&quot;:<br>    var lastVisitedView = self<br>    var currentFrame = regionInWindow<br></p><p>    // walk &quot;upstream&quot; (starting from our superview), skipping:<br>    // - superviews that don&#39;t clip-to-bounds<br>    // - the window (since we already took our intersection with it)<br>    for upstreamView in self.exclusiveSuperviewSequence() where upstreamView.clipsToBounds &amp;&amp; upstreamView !== w {<br>      // finding a nil intersection =&gt; not visible, early-exit<br>      guard let upstreamIntersection = lastVisitedView.intersectionRegion(with: upstreamView) else {<br>        return nil<br>      }<br>      lastVisitedView = upstreamView<br>      currentFrame = upstreamIntersection<br>    }<br>    // belt-and-suspenders final steps:<br>    assert(!currentFrame.isEmpty &amp;&amp; !currentFrame.isNull)<br>    return self.convertRect(<br>      currentFrame, <br>      fromView: lastVisitedView<br>    ).onlyIfNonEmpty<br>  }<br></p><p>…and without `where` on `for`-`in` loops, the main `for` loop winds up looking like one of these:<br></p><p>    // with `if`:<br>    for upstreamView in self.exclusiveSuperviewSequence() {<br>      if upstreamView.clipsToBounds &amp;&amp; upstreamView !== w {<br>        // finding a nil intersection =&gt; not visible, early-exit<br>        guard let upstreamIntersection = lastVisitedView.intersectionRegion(with: upstreamView) else {<br>          return nil<br>        }<br>        lastVisitedView = upstreamView<br>        currentFrame = upstreamIntersection<br>      }<br>    }<br></p><p>    // with mixed-guard usage:<br>    for upstreamView in self.exclusiveSuperviewSequence() {<br>      guard upstreamView.clipsToBounds &amp;&amp; upstreamView !== w else {<br>        continue<br>      }<br>      // finding a nil intersection =&gt; not visible, early-exit<br>      guard let upstreamIntersection = lastVisitedView.intersectionRegion(with: upstreamView) else {<br>        return nil<br>      }<br>      lastVisitedView = upstreamView<br>      currentFrame = upstreamIntersection<br>      }<br>    }<br></p><p>…and again neither one is *awful*, but:<br></p><p>- the one with `if` adds another level of nesting (annoying!)<br>- the one with “guard” has mixed “guard” usage (continue/exit)<br></p><p>…and since I like to stick to early-exit guard—it makes it easier to read if “guard == exit method”—I’d have to go with the nesting option, which I just don’t like much.<br></p><p>Those are the strongest examples I can find; the rest are all essentially like this:<br></p><p>  extension Dictionary {<br></p><p>    // with `where`<br>    func mapValues&lt;T&gt;(excludingKeys keySet: Set&lt;Key&gt;, @noescape valueMap: (Value) -&gt;

I didn&#39;t have any trouble with it at all. It follows one of the most basic programming patterns ever: &quot;For all x in X, if predicate P is true, do something.&quot; The use of the keyword &quot;where&quot; makes perfect sense in that context, and when I read it out loud, it sounds natural: &quot;For all x in X where P, do something.&quot; That is an elegant, succinct, and clear way of stating exactly what I want my program to do.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I don&#39;t doubt that it has caused some confusion for some people, but I&#39;m not sold that that is a good enough reason to get rid of it. It seems strange to get rid of a tool because not everyone understands how to use it immediately, without ever having to ask a single question. As long as its not a dangerous tool (and it isn&#39;t), then keep it in the workshop for those times when it comes in handy. And even if there is some initial confusion, it doesn&#39;t sound like it lasted that long. It&#39;s more like, &quot;Does this work like X, or does this work like Y?

My own 2c on it<br>&gt; is that I think if you look at isolated uses of `where` it’s not adding<br>&gt; much clarity, but having it can allow you to adopt more-consistent patterns<br>&gt; overall…which IMHO *does* result in clearer code.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I’ll provide two examples of such “consistent patterns” and how the<br>&gt; presence of `for`-`in` `where` helps stick with them.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; First Pattern: for some simple types I like to do data-driven unit tests —<br>&gt; here’s a collection of values to test, here’s a basic, “algebraic&quot; property<br>&gt; that should apply, test it actually does, and so on.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; When I write a set of tests like that, I like to have a single variable<br>&gt; holding the “instances to test” that is shared by all relevant tests; this<br>&gt; lets me start with only a handful of values, confirm it seems to work, and<br>&gt; then have a single place to edit once I’m ready to expand the values we<br>&gt; test upon.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Such tests might wind up looking like this:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   func testNaiveAncestor() {<br>&gt;      // the root has no ancestor so we simply to skip it:<br>&gt;      for position in testPositions where !position.isRootPosition {<br>&gt;         XCTAssertLessThan(<br>&gt;          position.naiveAncestor(),<br>&gt;          position<br>&gt;         )<br>&gt;      }<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   func testNaiveSuccessor() {<br>&gt;      for position in testPositions {<br>&gt;         XCTAssertGreaterThan(<br>&gt;          position.naiveSuccessor(),<br>&gt;          position<br>&gt;         )<br>&gt;      }<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; …where `testPositions` holds the values to test, and the two tests are<br>&gt; each testing a basic algebraic property. Having `where` available on<br>&gt; for-loops makes it possible to write these in such a way that the intended<br>&gt; parallelism between the two is visually-apparent—you can tell they’re the<br>&gt; same sort of thing just by looking at them—and it does so in a way that<br>&gt; makes few assumptions on the type-or-contents of `testPositions`.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>First, notice how your comment is related to the `where` clause but is<br>actually sitting on top of the loop itself.

So this<br>certainly cannot be a justification for another feature (i.e. `where`)<br>which only incidentally provides a substitute solution in certain<br>situations.<br></p><p><br>&gt; This is as short as I can make it:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   /// Returns the portion of our frame that *might* be visible on-screen;<br>&gt; doesn&#39;t<br>&gt;   /// handle occlusion, but unlike `approximateWindowRegion` will account<br>&gt; for<br>&gt;   /// clipping done by our superviews.<br>&gt;

      return nil<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     // now we prepare to &quot;walk upstream&quot;:<br>&gt;     var lastVisitedView = self<br>&gt;     var currentFrame = regionInWindow<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     // walk &quot;upstream&quot; (starting from our superview), skipping:<br>&gt;     // - superviews that don&#39;t clip-to-bounds<br>&gt;     // - the window (since we already took our intersection with it)<br>&gt;     for upstreamView in self.exclusiveSuperviewSequence() where<br>&gt; upstreamView.clipsToBounds &amp;&amp; upstreamView !== w {<br>&gt;       // finding a nil intersection =&gt; not visible, early-exit<br>&gt;       guard let upstreamIntersection =<br>&gt; lastVisitedView.intersectionRegion(with: upstreamView) else {<br>&gt;         return nil<br>&gt;       }<br>&gt;       lastVisitedView = upstreamView<br>&gt;       currentFrame = upstreamIntersection<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;     // belt-and-suspenders final steps:<br>&gt;     assert(!currentFrame.isEmpty &amp;&amp; !currentFrame.isNull)<br>&gt;     return self.convertRect(<br>&gt;       currentFrame,<br>&gt;       fromView: lastVisitedView<br>&gt;     ).onlyIfNonEmpty<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; …and without `where` on `for`-`in` loops, the main `for` loop winds up<br>&gt; looking like one of these:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     // with `if`:<br>&gt;     for upstreamView in self.exclusiveSuperviewSequence() {<br>&gt;       if upstreamView.clipsToBounds &amp;&amp; upstreamView !== w {<br>&gt;         // finding a nil intersection =&gt; not visible, early-exit<br>&gt;         guard let upstreamIntersection =<br>&gt; lastVisitedView.intersectionRegion(with: upstreamView) else {<br>&gt;           return nil<br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;         lastVisitedView = upstreamView<br>&gt;         currentFrame = upstreamIntersection<br>&gt;       }<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     // with mixed-guard usage:<br>&gt;     for upstreamView in self.exclusiveSuperviewSequence() {<br>&gt;       guard upstreamView.clipsToBounds &amp;&amp; upstreamView !== w else {<br>&gt;         continue<br>&gt;       }<br>&gt;       // finding a nil intersection =&gt; not visible, early-exit<br>&gt;       guard let upstreamIntersection =<br>&gt; lastVisitedView.intersectionRegion(with: upstreamView) else {<br>&gt;         return nil<br>&gt;       }<br>&gt;       lastVisitedView = upstreamView<br>&gt;       currentFrame = upstreamIntersection<br>&gt;       }<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; …and again neither one is *awful*, but:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - the one with `if` adds another level of nesting (annoying!)<br>&gt; - the one with “guard” has mixed “guard” usage (continue/exit)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; …and since I like to stick to early-exit guard—it makes it easier to read<br>&gt; if “guard == exit method”—I’d have to go with the nesting option, which I<br>&gt; just don’t like much.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Those are the strongest examples I can find; the rest are all essentially<br>&gt; like this:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   extension Dictionary {<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     // with `where`<br>&gt;     func mapValues&lt;T&gt;(excludingKeys keySet: Set&lt;Key&gt;, @noescape valueMap:<br>&gt; (Value) -&gt; T) -&gt; [Key:T] {<br>&gt;       guard !keySet.isEmpty else {<br>&gt;         return self.mapValues(valueMap)<br>&gt;       }<br>&gt;       var result: [Key:T] = [:]<br>&gt;       for (key,value) in self where !keySet.contains(key) {<br>&gt;         result[key] = valueMap(result)<br>&gt;       }<br>&gt;       return result<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     // without `where`, `if`:<br>&gt;     func mapValues&lt;T&gt;(excludingKeys keySet: Set&lt;Key&gt;, @noescape valueMap:<br>&gt; (Value) -&gt; T) -&gt; [Key:T] {<br>&gt;       guard !keySet.isEmpty else {<br>&gt;         return self.mapValues(valueMap)<br>&gt;       }<br>&gt;       var result: [Key:T] = [:]<br>&gt;       for (key,value) in self {<br>&gt;         if !keySet.contains(key) {<br>&gt;           result[key] = valueMap(result)<br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;       }<br>&gt;       return result<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     // without `where`, `guard`:<br>&gt;     func mapValues&lt;T&gt;(excludingKeys keySet: Set&lt;Key&gt;, @noescape valueMap:<br>&gt; (Value) -&gt; T) -&gt; [Key:T] {<br>&gt;       guard !keySet.isEmpty else {<br>&gt;         return self.mapValues(valueMap)<br>&gt;       }<br>&gt;       var result: [Key:T] = [:]<br>&gt;       for (key,value) in self {<br>&gt;         guard keySet.contains(key) else {<br>&gt;           continue<br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;         result[key] = valueMap(result)<br>&gt;       }<br>&gt;       return result<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; …where again I don’t like “continue” `guard` and thus would wind up<br>&gt; picking the `if` variant, which adds another level of nesting (or use<br>&gt; `.lazy.filter` and trust the compiler’s going to boil away the overhead for<br>&gt; me).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So in conclusion, IMHO `where` on a `for`-`in` is a *modest* improvement<br>&gt; in clarity when considered in isolation, but is handier than it may<br>&gt; initially seem b/c it can allow for broader overall consistency of style.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I thus would be in favor of keeping `where` on for-in, or if it must be<br>&gt; removed doing so with the intent to restore some better-designed equivalent<br>&gt;

So this certainly cannot be a justification for another feature (i.e. `where`) which only incidentally provides a substitute solution in certain situations.<br></p><p>Personally I found this use of `where` completely unremarkable and something I never thought about until I saw this discussion gaining momentum; I was already used to similar constructs so it just seemed useful in a familiar and thoroughly-uninteresting way.<br></p><p>That said, I could get behind excising it if there was serious interest in eventually building-in something like LINQ or comprehensions (etc.); `where` after a for-in is at this point a bit of an odd duckling.<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160612/111d87c6/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d8867167dba9b648c6d0746a67bbc721?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Retiring `where` from for-in loops</strong> from <string>Goffredo Marocchi</string> &lt;panajev at gmail.com&gt;<p>June 10, 2016 at 07:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>I think sometimes the community in this mailing list loses sight on the fact that coding is a creative  endeavour much similar to architectural design or painting.

Otherwise it seems like it’s based on a mistaken assumption that the for in loop wants to terminate rather than continue, but really its purpose is to visit as many matching elements of a sequence as possible (even with c-style for loops most for loops tend to be finite in a way that you can predict the number of loops before they run if you want to), whereas while loops can be considered designed to fail, at least that’s how I was taught to use them. Of course both can be infinite and there’s overlap in how they’re used, but this is how I think about them, and thus what shapes conditions placed upon them.<br></p><p>Again though, if there’ll only be one loop with a where clause like this then I’m not sure it’s as much of an issue.<br></p><p><br>The obvious solution to clarity or lack of implied meaning is to either add detail (which narrows the gap on guard continue) or rename the keyword to something.

But it is<br>&gt; one of several prongs here: `where` is not only inessential, I argue that<br>&gt; it lacks expressiveness (in that what is enabled by it can be expressed<br>&gt; equally or even more cogently with `guard`, a more general and more<br>&gt; expressive syntax overall), and it detracts from rather than helps with<br>&gt; writing correct code, because we hear attestations that its use has gone<br>&gt; awry (and the going awry happens at runtime!). So in essence, I would be<br>&gt; content with inessential but expressive solutions, but here I argue that<br>&gt; `where` is neither essential nor expressive.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You’ve argued this several times, but I think the code speaks well enough<br>&gt; for itself:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; for eachValue in theValues where eachValue.isOdd { … }<br>&gt; for eachValue in theValues {<br>&gt; guard eachValue.isOdd else { continue }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Not only is it an extra 15+ characters, it’s an extra line, so there’s a<br>&gt; definite saving right away.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The key issue is people misunderstanding that where is equivalent to<br>&gt; continue and not break; this may be an issue of consistency, which will go<br>&gt; away if “where” is doomed to be removed from conditionals (which I believe<br>&gt; includes while loops). Otherwise it seems like it’s based on a mistaken<br>&gt; assumption that the for in loop wants to terminate rather than continue,<br>&gt; but really its purpose is to visit as many matching elements of a sequence<br>&gt; as possible (even with c-style for loops most for loops tend to be finite<br>&gt; in a way that you can predict the number of loops before they run if you<br>&gt; want to), whereas while loops can be considered designed to fail, at least<br>&gt; that’s how I was taught to use them.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>I&#39;m glad this mental model makes sense to you. I&#39;m not in the business of<br>regularly teaching coding, but this is the first I&#39;ve heard of the idea<br>that &quot;while loops want to break, but for loops want to continue.&quot; I don&#39;t<br>think this is a widely shared conception of those loops.<br></p><p><br>&gt; Of course both can be infinite and there’s overlap in how they’re used,<br>&gt; but this is how I think about them, and thus what shapes conditions placed<br>&gt; upon them.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Again though, if there’ll only be one loop with a where clause like this<br>&gt; then I’m not sure it’s as much of an issue.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The obvious solution to clarity or lack of implied meaning is to either<br>&gt; add detail (which narrows the gap on guard continue) or rename the keyword<br>&gt; to something. In terms of the clarity I’m actually disappointed that Swift<br>&gt; doesn’t use the do keyword for loops, as I find the following very clear:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; for eachValue in theValues where eachValue.isOdd do { … }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Reading the last part in isolation “where eachValue.isOdd do” is clearer<br>&gt; that the block is skipped, but that the loop isn’t. This is essentially how<br>&gt; I read loop blocks already, but since we have a “do” keyword I wish we<br>&gt; could use it like this, as I would on all my loops.

For all we know,<br>once they learned the way it works, they may have said, &quot;Hey that&#39;s cool!<br>I&#39;m gonna use that from now on!&quot;<br></p><p>In other words, you seem to be talking about removing a feature that is<br>liked by *a lot* people, based on some unsubstantiated reports of user<br>error that may or may not have been totally unsubstantial.<br></p><p>I don&#39;t want new programmers to be confused, either, but the &quot;where&quot; clause<br>is such a basic programming construct - the keyword is new, but the idea<br>itself is as old as programming - that I don&#39;t mind expecting new<br>programmers to learn how to use it. The learning curve should be incredibly<br>short - it is nothing more than a filter operation.<br></p><p>There&#39;s something else here that is really important to me, though I don&#39;t<br>know how others feel about it.<br></p><p>Using the guard...continue approach that you are promoting is a code smell.<br>It puts control-flow logic inside the for-in loop. That is something I have<br>always tried to avoid. I know that the language allows for it, but I<br>believe it is bad programming practice. In fact, if you get rid of the<br>`where` keyword, I&#39;m still not going to use guard...continue. I&#39;ll just<br>filter the collection first and then loop it.<br></p><p>It is a code smell for the same reason that messing with the index inside a<br>for;; loop was a code smell. I was always taught never to do this:<br></p><p>for var i = 0; i &lt; array.count, i++ {<br>  if iWantThisToLoopAnExtraTime {<br>    i--<br>  }<br>}<br></p><p>Why? Because code like that is confusing. It becomes difficult to know how<br>many times the loop will execute, what the looping logic is, etc. Sure, I<br>might get away with it most of the time, but it is bad practice and there<br>is always a better way to do what you want to do. The only thing that keeps<br>you from the better way is laziness.<br></p><p>The same is true (albeit to a lesser degree) for the guard...continue. It<br>may not be as extreme, but it is still a code smell. It divides the<br>control-flow logic into two parts - one outside the loop, and one inside<br>the loop, and it suddenly becomes twice as easy to miss something.<br></p><p>Using for-in-where, all of the control-flow logic is on one single line,<br>and once it is known that &quot;where&quot; operates as a filter operation, it all<br>works together in a single, harmonious statement that declares exactly what<br>is going to happen in a way that is totally unambiguous.<br></p><p>So by getting rid of the &quot;where&quot; clause, I believe that you are actually<br>encouraging bad programming practice. Instead of encouraging the new user<br>to learn this very simple construct that will ultimately make their code<br>safer and more expressive without dividing their control-flow logic<br>unnecessarily into two separate parts, you are encouraging them to just &quot;do<br>what they know&quot;. I think that is terrible, and you are doing them a<br>disservice.<br></p><p>And from a personal standpoint, you are telling me that I have to write<br>smelly code, even though there is this perfectly good non-smelly option<br>sitting right there, because you don&#39;t want someone else to have to learn<br>something.<br></p><p>On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 5:29 AM Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; I think this discussion has made it pretty plain that what is claimed to<br>&gt; be &#39;so useful&#39; is barely ever used.

Here&#39;s may take on it:<br></p><p><br>   - &quot;continue if false&quot;<br>   - This is the current &#39;where` keyword.<br>   - &quot;continue if true&quot;<br>      - This is the inverse of the current &#39;where&#39; option. Because it is<br>      the inverse, it doesn&#39;t need a separate keyword. You just add the logical<br>      not &#39;!&#39; to the predicate, or just reverse the test, to obtain the inverse<br>      filtering operation.<br>      - So, for example, `for string in strings where<br>      string.hasPrefix(&quot;somePrefix&quot;)` becomes `for string in strings where<br>      !string.hasPrefix(&quot;somePrefix&quot;)`; or `for x in xs where x &lt; 5`, becomes<br>      `for x in xs where x &gt;= 5`<br>      - Using a single keyword but reversing the predicate isn&#39;t the only<br>      approach but it has the advantage of not polluting the language with<br>      unnecessary keywords where a single keyword can do the job.<br>   - &quot;break if false&quot;<br>      - In this scenario, you start looping through a collection, but exit<br>      early when some condition is no longer true. It combines a for...in loop<br>      with a &#39;while&#39; loop.<br>      - This construct would allow you to set a condition for early exit<br>      from the loop. The problem I see with this is that when I need to exit a<br>      loop early, I usually need to do something else first, like<br>assign a value<br>      to a variable, or take some other action. So for example, I might do<br>      something like this:<br></p><p>var nextEvent: Event?<br>for event in events {<br>    if event.time &gt;= now  {<br>        nextEvent = event<br>        break<br>    }<br>}<br></p><p>   - The point is that before I could use &#39;break&#39;, I had to take some<br>      action (assign a value to nextEvent). So just defining an early exit<br>      condition wouldn&#39;t really work. I&#39;m trying to think of a use-case where I<br>      would want to exit early without doing anything first, and I can&#39;t. Given<br>      the appropriate use case, however, I could see a place for a keyword that<br>      did this like &#39;until&#39;, or &#39;while&#39;. Until then, though, I<br>wouldn&#39;t create a<br>      keyword for something that doesn&#39;t have a common use. Filtering with<br>      &#39;where&#39; is at least used sometimes, even if it isn&#39;t the most common<br>      pattern on the planet.<br>   - &quot;break if true&quot;<br>      - I would apply the same arguments in &quot;break if false&quot;<br></p><p>So I would say that &quot;continue if false&quot; and &quot;continue if true&quot; are<br>accomplished using the same keyword, and &quot;break if false&quot; and &quot;break if<br>true&quot; don&#39;t have demonstrated use cases that can be solved with a<br>keyword/predicate combination - early exit usually requires some additional<br>action other than just exiting which couldn&#39;t be easily baked into the<br>keyword.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt; Thank you,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -- Erica<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160613/71f93d81/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ab486d7597af4cfe0be33a762150848?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Retiring `where` from for-in loops</strong> from <string>Dany St-Amant</string> &lt;dsa.mls at icloud.com&gt;<p>June 13, 2016 at 08:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Le 13 juin 2016 à 11:54, Erica Sadun via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jun 13, 2016, at 9:44 AM, let var go via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I think we must be reading different discussions.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; What I have seen in this discussion is the following:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; a) The need to filter a for-in loop doesn&#39;t arise that often; but,<br>&gt;&gt; b) When it does arise, everyone who has chimed in on this thread (except the two people who are proposing the change) thinks that the &quot;where&quot; clause is the clearest, most expressive way to do it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; As a point of order, may I request you stop singling out &quot;the two people who are proposing the change&quot; and discuss the merits of the pitch rather than the people involved in the discussion.

For all we know,<br>&gt; once they learned the way it works, they may have said, &quot;Hey that&#39;s cool!<br>&gt; I&#39;m gonna use that from now on!&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In other words, you seem to be talking about removing a feature that is<br>&gt; liked by *a lot* people, based on some unsubstantiated reports of user<br>&gt; error that may or may not have been totally unsubstantial.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I don&#39;t want new programmers to be confused, either, but the &quot;where&quot;<br>&gt; clause is such a basic programming construct - the keyword is new, but the<br>&gt; idea itself is as old as programming - that I don&#39;t mind expecting new<br>&gt; programmers to learn how to use it. The learning curve should be incredibly<br>&gt; short - it is nothing more than a filter operation.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; There&#39;s something else here that is really important to me, though I don&#39;t<br>&gt; know how others feel about it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Using the guard...continue approach that you are promoting is a code<br>&gt; smell. It puts control-flow logic inside the for-in loop. That is something<br>&gt; I have always tried to avoid. I know that the language allows for it, but I<br>&gt; believe it is bad programming practice. In fact, if you get rid of the<br>&gt; `where` keyword, I&#39;m still not going to use guard...continue. I&#39;ll just<br>&gt; filter the collection first and then loop it.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>This is quite the statement. It sounds like you&#39;d be for the elimination of<br>`continue`?<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt; It is a code smell for the same reason that messing with the index inside<br>&gt; a for;; loop was a code smell. I was always taught never to do this:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; for var i = 0; i &lt; array.count, i++ {<br>&gt;   if iWantThisToLoopAnExtraTime {<br>&gt;     i--<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Why? Because code like that is confusing. It becomes difficult to know how<br>&gt; many times the loop will execute, what the looping logic is, etc. Sure, I<br>&gt; might get away with it most of the time, but it is bad practice and there<br>&gt; is always a better way to do what you want to do. The only thing that keeps<br>&gt; you from the better way is laziness.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The same is true (albeit to a lesser degree) for the guard...continue. It<br>&gt; may not be as extreme, but it is still a code smell. It divides the<br>&gt; control-flow logic into two parts - one outside the loop, and one inside<br>&gt; the loop, and it suddenly becomes twice as easy to miss something.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Using for-in-where, all of the control-flow logic is on one single line,<br>&gt; and once it is known that &quot;where&quot; operates as a filter operation, it all<br>&gt; works together in a single, harmonious statement that declares exactly what<br>&gt; is going to happen in a way that is totally unambiguous.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So by getting rid of the &quot;where&quot; clause, I believe that you are actually<br>&gt; encouraging bad programming practice. Instead of encouraging the new user<br>&gt; to learn this very simple construct that will ultimately make their code<br>&gt; safer and more expressive without dividing their control-flow logic<br>&gt; unnecessarily into two separate parts, you are encouraging them to just &quot;do<br>&gt; what they know&quot;. I think that is terrible, and you are doing them a<br>&gt; disservice.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And from a personal standpoint, you are telling me that I have to write<br>&gt; smelly code, even though there is this perfectly good non-smelly option<br>&gt; sitting right there, because you don&#39;t want someone else to have to learn<br>&gt; something.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 5:29 AM Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I think this discussion has made it pretty plain that what is claimed to<br>&gt;&gt; be &#39;so useful&#39; is barely ever used.

For all we<br>&gt;&gt; know, once they learned the way it works, they may have said, &quot;Hey that&#39;s<br>&gt;&gt; cool! I&#39;m gonna use that from now on!&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; In other words, you seem to be talking about removing a feature that is<br>&gt;&gt; liked by *a lot* people, based on some unsubstantiated reports of user<br>&gt;&gt; error that may or may not have been totally unsubstantial.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t want new programmers to be confused, either, but the &quot;where&quot;<br>&gt;&gt; clause is such a basic programming construct - the keyword is new, but the<br>&gt;&gt; idea itself is as old as programming - that I don&#39;t mind expecting new<br>&gt;&gt; programmers to learn how to use it. The learning curve should be incredibly<br>&gt;&gt; short - it is nothing more than a filter operation.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; There&#39;s something else here that is really important to me, though I<br>&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know how others feel about it.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Using the guard...continue approach that you are promoting is a code<br>&gt;&gt; smell. It puts control-flow logic inside the for-in loop. That is something<br>&gt;&gt; I have always tried to avoid. I know that the language allows for it, but I<br>&gt;&gt; believe it is bad programming practice. In fact, if you get rid of the<br>&gt;&gt; `where` keyword, I&#39;m still not going to use guard...continue. I&#39;ll just<br>&gt;&gt; filter the collection first and then loop it.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This is quite the statement. It sounds like you&#39;d be for the elimination<br>&gt; of `continue`?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; It is a code smell for the same reason that messing with the index inside<br>&gt;&gt; a for;; loop was a code smell. I was always taught never to do this:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; for var i = 0; i &lt; array.count, i++ {<br>&gt;&gt;   if iWantThisToLoopAnExtraTime {<br>&gt;&gt;     i--<br>&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Why? Because code like that is confusing. It becomes difficult to know<br>&gt;&gt; how many times the loop will execute, what the looping logic is, etc. Sure,<br>&gt;&gt; I might get away with it most of the time, but it is bad practice and there<br>&gt;&gt; is always a better way to do what you want to do. The only thing that keeps<br>&gt;&gt; you from the better way is laziness.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The same is true (albeit to a lesser degree) for the guard...continue. It<br>&gt;&gt; may not be as extreme, but it is still a code smell. It divides the<br>&gt;&gt; control-flow logic into two parts - one outside the loop, and one inside<br>&gt;&gt; the loop, and it suddenly becomes twice as easy to miss something.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Using for-in-where, all of the control-flow logic is on one single line,<br>&gt;&gt; and once it is known that &quot;where&quot; operates as a filter operation, it all<br>&gt;&gt; works together in a single, harmonious statement that declares exactly what<br>&gt;&gt; is going to happen in a way that is totally unambiguous.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; So by getting rid of the &quot;where&quot; clause, I believe that you are actually<br>&gt;&gt; encouraging bad programming practice. Instead of encouraging the new user<br>&gt;&gt; to learn this very simple construct that will ultimately make their code<br>&gt;&gt; safer and more expressive without dividing their control-flow logic<br>&gt;&gt; unnecessarily into two separate parts, you are encouraging them to just &quot;do<br>&gt;&gt; what they know&quot;. I think that is terrible, and you are doing them a<br>&gt;&gt; disservice.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; And from a personal standpoint, you are telling me that I have to write<br>&gt;&gt; smelly code, even though there is this perfectly good non-smelly option<br>&gt;&gt; sitting right there, because you don&#39;t want someone else to have to learn<br>&gt;&gt; something.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 5:29 AM Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this discussion has made it pretty plain that what is claimed to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; be &#39;so useful&#39; is barely ever used.

I didn&#39;t have any trouble<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with it at all. It follows one of the most basic programming patterns ever:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;For all x in X, if predicate P is true, do something.&quot; The use of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keyword &quot;where&quot; makes perfect sense in that context, and when I read it out<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; loud, it sounds natural: &quot;For all x in X where P, do something.&quot; That is an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elegant, succinct, and clear way of stating exactly what I want my program<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t doubt that it has caused some confusion for some people, but<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sold that that is a good enough reason to get rid of it. It seems<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; strange to get rid of a tool because not everyone understands how to use it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; immediately, without ever having to ask a single question. As long as its<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not a dangerous tool (and it isn&#39;t), then keep it in the workshop for those<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; times when it comes in handy. And even if there is some initial confusion,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it doesn&#39;t sound like it lasted that long.

For all we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know, once they learned the way it works, they may have said, &quot;Hey that&#39;s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cool!

The learning curve should be incredibly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; short - it is nothing more than a filter operation.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#39;s something else here that is really important to me, though I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know how others feel about it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using the guard...continue approach that you are promoting is a code<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; smell. It puts control-flow logic inside the for-in loop. That is something<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have always tried to avoid. I know that the language allows for it, but I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believe it is bad programming practice. In fact, if you get rid of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `where` keyword, I&#39;m still not going to use guard...continue.

It follows one of the most basic programming patterns ever:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;For all x in X, if predicate P is true, do something.&quot; The use of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keyword &quot;where&quot; makes perfect sense in that context, and when I read it out<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; loud, it sounds natural: &quot;For all x in X where P, do something.&quot; That is an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elegant, succinct, and clear way of stating exactly what I want my program<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t doubt that it has caused some confusion for some people, but<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sold that that is a good enough reason to get rid of it. It seems<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; strange to get rid of a tool because not everyone understands how to use it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; immediately, without ever having to ask a single question. As long as its<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not a dangerous tool (and it isn&#39;t), then keep it in the workshop for those<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; times when it comes in handy. And even if there is some initial confusion,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it doesn&#39;t sound like it lasted that long. It&#39;s more like, &quot;Does this work<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like X, or does this work like Y? Let&#39;s see...oh, it works like X. Ok.&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That&#39;s the entire learning curve...about 5 seconds of curiosity followed by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the blissful feeling of resolution.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, Jun 10, 2016 at 9:32 AM Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, Jun 10, 2016 at 11:23 AM, Sean Heber via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; And to follow-up to myself once again, I went to my &quot;Cool 3rd<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Party Swift Repos&quot; folder and did the same search.

My own Swift projects (not on Github :P) use “where” all<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the time with for loops.

Perhaps there’s some factor of prior background at<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work here? (I’ve done a lot of SQL in another life, for example.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is worrying if true, because it suggests that it&#39;s enabling<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;dialects&#39; of Swift, an explicit anti-goal of the language.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I feel like “where” is a more declarative construct and that we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should be encouraging that way of thinking in general.

In other words, you claim that<br>&gt; `guard...continue` is harmful. That is grounds for removal, and if you<br>&gt; believe it to be true, I encourage you to propose it to the list and get<br>&gt; feedback on that opinion.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If you&#39;re saying that you simply don&#39;t prefer it for reasons of &#39;style,&#39;<br>&gt; again I emphasize that the topic at hand here is not about personal coding<br>&gt; style. The claim we are making is that `where` is harmful. I too like it<br>&gt; for style, and I&#39;ll be sad to see it go. But I have concluded that it must<br>&gt; go.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; There is also a big difference between &#39;break&#39; and &#39;continue&#39;. I am not<br>&gt;&gt; afraid to use &#39;break&#39;, and I don&#39;t consider it a code smell. It allows for<br>&gt;&gt; early exit from a loop based on conditions that are not always known at the<br>&gt;&gt; time the loop is entered. for...in loops are necessary precisely because<br>&gt;&gt; they allow for the early exit.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; You don&#39;t need for...in if you want to continue - you can use forEach for<br>&gt;&gt; that. Instead of using &#39;continue&#39;, you just use &#39;return&#39; without doing<br>&gt;&gt; anything and it moves on to the next iteration. So really, the only purpose<br>&gt;&gt; that for...in serves that is not served by forEach is early exit. But<br>&gt;&gt; regardless, *even if for...in served no additional purpose that couldn&#39;t<br>&gt;&gt; be served by forEach, I would keep it in the language because there are<br>&gt;&gt; situations where I believe it is easier to read, and expressiveness and<br>&gt;&gt; clarity are important to me.*<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 10:55 Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 10:44 AM, let var go &lt;letvargo at gmail.com&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think we must be reading different discussions.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What I have seen in this discussion is the following:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a) The need to filter a for-in loop doesn&#39;t arise that often; but,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; b) When it does arise, everyone who has chimed in on this thread<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (except the two people who are proposing the change) thinks that the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;where&quot; clause is the clearest, most expressive way to do it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Something that would help me get on board with this change is more<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence about what kind of problems it is actually creating.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As best I can tell, this proposal got started because &quot;somewhere&quot; some<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new programmers (no one knows how many) expressed some confusion (no one<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knows how seriously they were confused, or how long it took them to figure<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it out) about how the where clause worked in a for-in loop. For all we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know, once they learned the way it works, they may have said, &quot;Hey that&#39;s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cool! I&#39;m gonna use that from now on!&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words, you seem to be talking about removing a feature that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is liked by *a lot* people, based on some unsubstantiated reports of user<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; error that may or may not have been totally unsubstantial.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t want new programmers to be confused, either, but the &quot;where&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clause is such a basic programming construct - the keyword is new, but the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; idea itself is as old as programming - that I don&#39;t mind expecting new<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programmers to learn how to use it. The learning curve should be incredibly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; short - it is nothing more than a filter operation.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#39;s something else here that is really important to me, though I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know how others feel about it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using the guard...continue approach that you are promoting is a code<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; smell. It puts control-flow logic inside the for-in loop. That is something<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have always tried to avoid. I know that the language allows for it, but I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believe it is bad programming practice. In fact, if you get rid of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `where` keyword, I&#39;m still not going to use guard...continue. I&#39;ll just<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; filter the collection first and then loop it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is quite the statement. It sounds like you&#39;d be for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elimination of `continue`?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a code smell for the same reason that messing with the index<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inside a for;; loop was a code smell. I was always taught never to do this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for var i = 0; i &lt; array.count, i++ {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   if iWantThisToLoopAnExtraTime {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     i--<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why? Because code like that is confusing. It becomes difficult to know<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how many times the loop will execute, what the looping logic is, etc. Sure,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I might get away with it most of the time, but it is bad practice and there<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is always a better way to do what you want to do. The only thing that keeps<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you from the better way is laziness.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The same is true (albeit to a lesser degree) for the guard...continue.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It may not be as extreme, but it is still a code smell. It divides the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; control-flow logic into two parts - one outside the loop, and one inside<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the loop, and it suddenly becomes twice as easy to miss something.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using for-in-where, all of the control-flow logic is on one single<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; line, and once it is known that &quot;where&quot; operates as a filter operation, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all works together in a single, harmonious statement that declares exactly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what is going to happen in a way that is totally unambiguous.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So by getting rid of the &quot;where&quot; clause, I believe that you are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually encouraging bad programming practice. Instead of encouraging the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new user to learn this very simple construct that will ultimately make<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their code safer and more expressive without dividing their control-flow<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; logic unnecessarily into two separate parts, you are encouraging them to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just &quot;do what they know&quot;. I think that is terrible, and you are doing them<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a disservice.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And from a personal standpoint, you are telling me that I have to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write smelly code, even though there is this perfectly good non-smelly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; option sitting right there, because you don&#39;t want someone else to have to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learn something.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 5:29 AM Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this discussion has made it pretty plain that what is claimed<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be &#39;so useful&#39; is barely ever used.

Among the 15 repos in<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that folder, a joint search returned about 650 hits on for-in (again with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some false positives) and not a single for-in-while use.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Weird. My own Swift projects (not on Github :P) use “where” all<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the time with for loops. I really like it and think it reads *and* writes<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; far better as well as makes for nicer one-liners. In one project, by rough<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; count, I have about 20 that use “where” vs. 40 in that same project not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using “where”.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In another smaller test project, there are only 10 for loops, but<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; even so one still managed to use where.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not a lot of data without looking at even more projects, I admit,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but this seems to suggest that the usage of “where” is going to be very<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; developer-dependent. Perhaps there’s some factor of prior background at<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work here? (I’ve done a lot of SQL in another life, for example.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is worrying if true, because it suggests that it&#39;s enabling<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;dialects&#39; of Swift, an explicit anti-goal of the language.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I feel like “where” is a more declarative construct and that we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should be encouraging that way of thinking in general. When using it, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feels like “magic” for some reason - even though there’s nothing special<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about it.

In general, it is not my goal to try and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; control how other people code their programs at all. I don&#39;t want to tell<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; you that you can&#39;t &#39;continue&#39; if you want to &#39;continue.&#39;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; *I am not trying to make everyone adopt my own personal coding style<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; and/or philosophy.*<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; We&#39;re not discussing style.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes, we are discussing style, and for a very simple reason: Style is<br>&gt; essential to readability and clarity.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; When we talk about for...in...where vs. guard...continue, all we are<br>&gt; talking about is style. In terms of functionality, they do exactly the same<br>&gt; thing. In terms of style, however, *one is easier to read than the<br>&gt; other. *<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Some people think that guard...continue is easier to read and understand.<br>&gt; Others, like me, think that for...in...where is easier to read and<br>&gt; understand. *But that is a disagreement over style, not functionality*.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And here is the difficult thing about debates like this: Both sides are<br>&gt; right. What I consider to be the clearest, most readable style of coding<br>&gt; may be confusing to someone else, and vice versa. Different people find<br>&gt; different styles confusing. Not everyone learns the same way. Not everyone<br>&gt; reads the same way. Not everyone codes the same way. What is hard for me to<br>&gt; understand may be easy for you to understand.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So if using &#39;continue&#39; inside your for...in loops makes sense to you, and<br>&gt; it helps you understand your own code, then go for it. It&#39;s not my style,<br>&gt; not because it is &quot;unfashionable&quot;, but because it has the opposite effect<br>&gt; on me - it makes the code harder for me to understand.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>You misunderstand me. I am not supporting this proposal because I think<br>`guard` is superior style. I am supporting it because I have come to the<br>conclusion that `where` is harmful. I do happen to think that `guard` is a<br>superior style, but that&#39;s not the motivation for removing `where`, nor<br>could it be a justification.<br></p><p><br>&gt; You made a very strong claim: use of `guard...continue` leads to &#39;smelly&#39;<br>&gt;&gt; code, or in other words bad code. In other words, you claim that<br>&gt;&gt; `guard...continue` is harmful. That is grounds for removal, and if you<br>&gt;&gt; believe it to be true, I encourage you to propose it to the list and get<br>&gt;&gt; feedback on that opinion.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; If you&#39;re saying that you simply don&#39;t prefer it for reasons of &#39;style,&#39;<br>&gt;&gt; again I emphasize that the topic at hand here is not about personal coding<br>&gt;&gt; style. The claim we are making is that `where` is harmful. I too like it<br>&gt;&gt; for style, and I&#39;ll be sad to see it go. But I have concluded that it must<br>&gt;&gt; go.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; There is also a big difference between &#39;break&#39; and &#39;continue&#39;. I am not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; afraid to use &#39;break&#39;, and I don&#39;t consider it a code smell. It allows for<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; early exit from a loop based on conditions that are not always known at the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; time the loop is entered. for...in loops are necessary precisely because<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; they allow for the early exit.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; You don&#39;t need for...in if you want to continue - you can use forEach<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; for that. Instead of using &#39;continue&#39;, you just use &#39;return&#39; without doing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; anything and it moves on to the next iteration. So really, the only purpose<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; that for...in serves that is not served by forEach is early exit. But<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; regardless, *even if for...in served no additional purpose that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; couldn&#39;t be served by forEach, I would keep it in the language because<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; there are situations where I believe it is easier to read, and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; expressiveness and clarity are important to me.*<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 10:55 Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 10:44 AM, let var go &lt;letvargo at gmail.com&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think we must be reading different discussions.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What I have seen in this discussion is the following:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a) The need to filter a for-in loop doesn&#39;t arise that often; but,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; b) When it does arise, everyone who has chimed in on this thread<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (except the two people who are proposing the change) thinks that the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;where&quot; clause is the clearest, most expressive way to do it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Something that would help me get on board with this change is more<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence about what kind of problems it is actually creating.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As best I can tell, this proposal got started because &quot;somewhere&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some new programmers (no one knows how many) expressed some confusion (no<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one knows how seriously they were confused, or how long it took them to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; figure it out) about how the where clause worked in a for-in loop. For all<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we know, once they learned the way it works, they may have said, &quot;Hey<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that&#39;s cool! I&#39;m gonna use that from now on!&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words, you seem to be talking about removing a feature that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is liked by *a lot* people, based on some unsubstantiated reports of user<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; error that may or may not have been totally unsubstantial.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t want new programmers to be confused, either, but the &quot;where&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clause is such a basic programming construct - the keyword is new, but the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; idea itself is as old as programming - that I don&#39;t mind expecting new<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programmers to learn how to use it. The learning curve should be incredibly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; short - it is nothing more than a filter operation.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#39;s something else here that is really important to me, though I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know how others feel about it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using the guard...continue approach that you are promoting is a code<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; smell. It puts control-flow logic inside the for-in loop. That is something<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have always tried to avoid. I know that the language allows for it, but I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believe it is bad programming practice. In fact, if you get rid of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `where` keyword, I&#39;m still not going to use guard...continue. I&#39;ll just<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; filter the collection first and then loop it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is quite the statement. It sounds like you&#39;d be for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elimination of `continue`?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a code smell for the same reason that messing with the index<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inside a for;; loop was a code smell. I was always taught never to do this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for var i = 0; i &lt; array.count, i++ {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   if iWantThisToLoopAnExtraTime {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     i--<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why? Because code like that is confusing. It becomes difficult to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know how many times the loop will execute, what the looping logic is, etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, I might get away with it most of the time, but it is bad practice and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there is always a better way to do what you want to do. The only thing that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keeps you from the better way is laziness.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The same is true (albeit to a lesser degree) for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; guard...continue. It may not be as extreme, but it is still a code smell.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It divides the control-flow logic into two parts - one outside the loop,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and one inside the loop, and it suddenly becomes twice as easy to miss<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using for-in-where, all of the control-flow logic is on one single<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; line, and once it is known that &quot;where&quot; operates as a filter operation, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all works together in a single, harmonious statement that declares exactly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what is going to happen in a way that is totally unambiguous.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So by getting rid of the &quot;where&quot; clause, I believe that you are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually encouraging bad programming practice. Instead of encouraging the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new user to learn this very simple construct that will ultimately make<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their code safer and more expressive without dividing their control-flow<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; logic unnecessarily into two separate parts, you are encouraging them to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just &quot;do what they know&quot;. I think that is terrible, and you are doing them<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a disservice.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And from a personal standpoint, you are telling me that I have to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write smelly code, even though there is this perfectly good non-smelly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; option sitting right there, because you don&#39;t want someone else to have to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learn something.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 5:29 AM Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this discussion has made it pretty plain that what is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claimed to be &#39;so useful&#39; is barely ever used.

I didn&#39;t have any trouble<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with it at all. It follows one of the most basic programming patterns ever:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;For all x in X, if predicate P is true, do something.&quot; The use of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keyword &quot;where&quot; makes perfect sense in that context, and when I read it out<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; loud, it sounds natural: &quot;For all x in X where P, do something.&quot; That is an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elegant, succinct, and clear way of stating exactly what I want my program<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t doubt that it has caused some confusion for some people,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but I&#39;m not sold that that is a good enough reason to get rid of it.

As long<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as its not a dangerous tool (and it isn&#39;t), then keep it in the workshop<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for those times when it comes in handy.

Ok.&quot; That&#39;s the entire learning curve...about 5 seconds of curiosity<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; followed by the blissful feeling of resolution.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, Jun 10, 2016 at 9:32 AM Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, Jun 10, 2016 at 11:23 AM, Sean Heber via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; And to follow-up to myself once again, I went to my &quot;Cool 3rd<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Party Swift Repos&quot; folder and did the same search.

My own Swift projects (not on Github :P) use “where” all<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the time with for loops. I really like it and think it reads *and* writes<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; far better as well as makes for nicer one-liners. In one project, by rough<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; count, I have about 20 that use “where” vs. 40 in that same project not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using “where”.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In another smaller test project, there are only 10 for loops,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but even so one still managed to use where.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not a lot of data without looking at even more projects, I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; admit, but this seems to suggest that the usage of “where” is going to be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very developer-dependent. Perhaps there’s some factor of prior background<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at work here? (I’ve done a lot of SQL in another life, for example.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is worrying if true, because it suggests that it&#39;s enabling<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;dialects&#39; of Swift, an explicit anti-goal of the language.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I feel like “where” is a more declarative construct and that we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should be encouraging that way of thinking in general. When using it, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feels like “magic” for some reason - even though there’s nothing special<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about it.

In general, it is not my goal to try and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; control how other people code their programs at all. I don&#39;t want to tell<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you that you can&#39;t &#39;continue&#39; if you want to &#39;continue.&#39;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *I am not trying to make everyone adopt my own personal coding style<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and/or philosophy.*<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#39;re not discussing style.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Yes, we are discussing style, and for a very simple reason: Style is<br>&gt;&gt; essential to readability and clarity.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; When we talk about for...in...where vs. guard...continue, all we are<br>&gt;&gt; talking about is style. In terms of functionality, they do exactly the same<br>&gt;&gt; thing. In terms of style, however, *one is easier to read than the<br>&gt;&gt; other. *<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Some people think that guard...continue is easier to read and understand.<br>&gt;&gt; Others, like me, think that for...in...where is easier to read and<br>&gt;&gt; understand. *But that is a disagreement over style, not functionality*.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; And here is the difficult thing about debates like this: Both sides are<br>&gt;&gt; right. What I consider to be the clearest, most readable style of coding<br>&gt;&gt; may be confusing to someone else, and vice versa. Different people find<br>&gt;&gt; different styles confusing. Not everyone learns the same way. Not everyone<br>&gt;&gt; reads the same way. Not everyone codes the same way. What is hard for me to<br>&gt;&gt; understand may be easy for you to understand.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; So if using &#39;continue&#39; inside your for...in loops makes sense to you, and<br>&gt;&gt; it helps you understand your own code, then go for it. It&#39;s not my style,<br>&gt;&gt; not because it is &quot;unfashionable&quot;, but because it has the opposite effect<br>&gt;&gt; on me - it makes the code harder for me to understand.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You misunderstand me. I am not supporting this proposal because I think<br>&gt; `guard` is superior style. I am supporting it because I have come to the<br>&gt; conclusion that `where` is harmful. I do happen to think that `guard` is a<br>&gt; superior style, but that&#39;s not the motivation for removing `where`, nor<br>&gt; could it be a justification.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>No, I didn&#39;t misunderstand you. You are talking about style, even if you<br>don&#39;t realize it. Examine these two pieces of code:<br></p><p>Example 1:<br>for x in xs where x &lt; 10 {<br>    print(x)<br>}<br></p><p>Example 2:<br>for x in xs {<br>    guard x &lt; 10 else { continue }<br>    print(x)<br>}<br></p><p>Example 1 and Example 2 are functionally equivalent. They do exactly the<br>same thing. They will produce exactly the same output. *They only differ<br>with regard to style.*<br></p><p>You think that Example 2 is a better style than Example 1 because you think<br>that Example 1 is confusing to new programmers. You argue that the<br>confusion is harmful.<br></p><p>I think that Example 1 is a better style than Example 2 because I think<br>that it is easier to read and expresses my intent with greater clarity.<br>Whatever cognitive burden is placed on the new programmer to learn about<br>the &#39;where&#39; clause is extremely modest and more than made up for by the<br>ability to express their intentions in a way that is both concise and<br>readable. Example 2, by contrast, looks cluttered and splits the<br>control-flow logic into two parts creating a cognitive burden that I<br>consider harmful.<br></p><p>These are debates about style, and that is okay, because style is about<br>clarity, readability, and expressiveness, all of which are essential<br>goals. *Style<br>is substance*. Half the battle is getting the computer to follow the<br>correct instructions. The other half is making the code readable so that<br>human beings can understand it - and that is a matter of style.<br></p><p>There are times where I will choose to use a &#39;continue&#39; statement inside a<br>for...in loop. The reason hardly ever has anything to do with functionality<br>- I could design the code differently to avoid that particular code smell<br>if I put my mind to it. No, I would choose the &#39;continue&#39; statement because<br>in that particular context it makes my code more accessible to human beings<br>(including myself, later on). The ability to choose one solution over<br>another for purely stylistic reasons means that I can maximize both the<br>functionality and the readability of my code.<br></p><p>This proposal prevents the programmer from writing the best possible code<br>because it disallows a stylistic choice that improves readability. I don&#39;t<br>like that. It means that I have to write code that is worse than it has to<br>be. It means that I have to write code that is uglier and more disjointed<br>than it needs to be. That doesn&#39;t make any sense at all.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; You made a very strong claim: use of `guard...continue` leads to &#39;smelly&#39;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; code, or in other words bad code. In other words, you claim that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; `guard...continue` is harmful. That is grounds for removal, and if you<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; believe it to be true, I encourage you to propose it to the list and get<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; feedback on that opinion.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If you&#39;re saying that you simply don&#39;t prefer it for reasons of &#39;style,&#39;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; again I emphasize that the topic at hand here is not about personal coding<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; style. The claim we are making is that `where` is harmful. I too like it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; for style, and I&#39;ll be sad to see it go. But I have concluded that it must<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; go.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is also a big difference between &#39;break&#39; and &#39;continue&#39;. I am not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; afraid to use &#39;break&#39;, and I don&#39;t consider it a code smell. It allows for<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; early exit from a loop based on conditions that are not always known at the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time the loop is entered. for...in loops are necessary precisely because<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they allow for the early exit.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You don&#39;t need for...in if you want to continue - you can use forEach<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for that. Instead of using &#39;continue&#39;, you just use &#39;return&#39; without doing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything and it moves on to the next iteration. So really, the only purpose<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that for...in serves that is not served by forEach is early exit. But<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regardless, *even if for...in served no additional purpose that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; couldn&#39;t be served by forEach, I would keep it in the language because<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there are situations where I believe it is easier to read, and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expressiveness and clarity are important to me.*<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 10:55 Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 10:44 AM, let var go &lt;letvargo at gmail.com&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think we must be reading different discussions.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What I have seen in this discussion is the following:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a) The need to filter a for-in loop doesn&#39;t arise that often; but,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; b) When it does arise, everyone who has chimed in on this thread<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (except the two people who are proposing the change) thinks that the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;where&quot; clause is the clearest, most expressive way to do it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Something that would help me get on board with this change is more<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence about what kind of problems it is actually creating.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As best I can tell, this proposal got started because &quot;somewhere&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some new programmers (no one knows how many) expressed some confusion (no<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one knows how seriously they were confused, or how long it took them to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; figure it out) about how the where clause worked in a for-in loop. For all<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we know, once they learned the way it works, they may have said, &quot;Hey<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that&#39;s cool! I&#39;m gonna use that from now on!&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words, you seem to be talking about removing a feature that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is liked by *a lot* people, based on some unsubstantiated reports of user<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; error that may or may not have been totally unsubstantial.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t want new programmers to be confused, either, but the &quot;where&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clause is such a basic programming construct - the keyword is new, but the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; idea itself is as old as programming - that I don&#39;t mind expecting new<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programmers to learn how to use it. The learning curve should be incredibly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; short - it is nothing more than a filter operation.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#39;s something else here that is really important to me, though I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know how others feel about it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using the guard...continue approach that you are promoting is a code<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; smell. It puts control-flow logic inside the for-in loop. That is something<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have always tried to avoid. I know that the language allows for it, but I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believe it is bad programming practice. In fact, if you get rid of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `where` keyword, I&#39;m still not going to use guard...continue. I&#39;ll just<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; filter the collection first and then loop it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is quite the statement. It sounds like you&#39;d be for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elimination of `continue`?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a code smell for the same reason that messing with the index<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inside a for;; loop was a code smell. I was always taught never to do this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for var i = 0; i &lt; array.count, i++ {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   if iWantThisToLoopAnExtraTime {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     i--<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why? Because code like that is confusing. It becomes difficult to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know how many times the loop will execute, what the looping logic is, etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, I might get away with it most of the time, but it is bad practice and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there is always a better way to do what you want to do. The only thing that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keeps you from the better way is laziness.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The same is true (albeit to a lesser degree) for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; guard...continue. It may not be as extreme, but it is still a code smell.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It divides the control-flow logic into two parts - one outside the loop,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and one inside the loop, and it suddenly becomes twice as easy to miss<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using for-in-where, all of the control-flow logic is on one single<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; line, and once it is known that &quot;where&quot; operates as a filter operation, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all works together in a single, harmonious statement that declares exactly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what is going to happen in a way that is totally unambiguous.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So by getting rid of the &quot;where&quot; clause, I believe that you are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually encouraging bad programming practice. Instead of encouraging the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new user to learn this very simple construct that will ultimately make<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their code safer and more expressive without dividing their control-flow<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; logic unnecessarily into two separate parts, you are encouraging them to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just &quot;do what they know&quot;. I think that is terrible, and you are doing them<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a disservice.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And from a personal standpoint, you are telling me that I have to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write smelly code, even though there is this perfectly good non-smelly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; option sitting right there, because you don&#39;t want someone else to have to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learn something.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 5:29 AM Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this discussion has made it pretty plain that what is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claimed to be &#39;so useful&#39; is barely ever used.

It<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seems strange to get rid of a tool because not everyone understands how to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use it immediately, without ever having to ask a single question. As long<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as its not a dangerous tool (and it isn&#39;t), then keep it in the workshop<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for those times when it comes in handy.

In terms of functionality, they do exactly the same<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; thing. In terms of style, however, *one is easier to read than the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; other. *<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Some people think that guard...continue is easier to read and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; understand. Others, like me, think that for...in...where is easier to read<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; and understand. *But that is a disagreement over style, not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; functionality*.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; And here is the difficult thing about debates like this: Both sides are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; right. What I consider to be the clearest, most readable style of coding<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; may be confusing to someone else, and vice versa. Different people find<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; different styles confusing. Not everyone learns the same way. Not everyone<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; reads the same way. Not everyone codes the same way. What is hard for me to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; understand may be easy for you to understand.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; So if using &#39;continue&#39; inside your for...in loops makes sense to you,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; and it helps you understand your own code, then go for it. It&#39;s not my<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; style, not because it is &quot;unfashionable&quot;, but because it has the opposite<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; effect on me - it makes the code harder for me to understand.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; You misunderstand me. I am not supporting this proposal because I think<br>&gt;&gt; `guard` is superior style. I am supporting it because I have come to the<br>&gt;&gt; conclusion that `where` is harmful. I do happen to think that `guard` is a<br>&gt;&gt; superior style, but that&#39;s not the motivation for removing `where`, nor<br>&gt;&gt; could it be a justification.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; No, I didn&#39;t misunderstand you. You are talking about style, even if you<br>&gt; don&#39;t realize it. Examine these two pieces of code:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Example 1:<br>&gt; for x in xs where x &lt; 10 {<br>&gt;     print(x)<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Example 2:<br>&gt; for x in xs {<br>&gt;     guard x &lt; 10 else { continue }<br>&gt;     print(x)<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Example 1 and Example 2 are functionally equivalent. They do exactly the<br>&gt; same thing. They will produce exactly the same output. *They only differ<br>&gt; with regard to style.*<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You think that Example 2 is a better style than Example 1 because you<br>&gt; think that Example 1 is confusing to new programmers. You argue that the<br>&gt; confusion is harmful.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>If you define &#39;style&#39; as the difference between any two things that produce<br>the same output, then indeed all language design is &#39;style.&#39; Writing in<br>Lisp vs. writing in C++ would be a choice of &#39;style.&#39; When you say that<br>Swift should accommodate your own &#39;style,&#39; then, that could just as well be<br>an argument for Lisp-like syntax. This is not, however, what people<br>generally understand to be &#39;coding style.&#39;<br></p><p>The fact is that there are even experienced users of Swift who see `where`<br>and affirmatively believe it does what it does not do. The same cannot be<br>said for `guard`. That is, a user might say, &#39;What in the world does guard<br>mean?&#39;, but even a totally new user is unlikely to say, &#39;I can guess what<br>guard means, and it means [something that guard does not in fact mean].&#39;<br>That is not at all an argument about style. And yes, I argue that confusion<br>is harmful.<br></p><p>I think that Example 1 is a better style than Example 2 because I think<br>&gt; that it is easier to read and expresses my intent with greater clarity.<br>&gt; Whatever cognitive burden is placed on the new programmer to learn about<br>&gt; the &#39;where&#39; clause is extremely modest and more than made up for by the<br>&gt; ability to express their intentions in a way that is both concise and<br>&gt; readable. Example 2, by contrast, looks cluttered and splits the<br>&gt; control-flow logic into two parts creating a cognitive burden that I<br>&gt; consider harmful.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>You are stretching here; `guard` imposes a &#39;harmful cognitive burden&#39;?<br>Again, if you truly believe that, please do propose a change to the list.<br></p><p>These are debates about style, and that is okay, because style is about<br>&gt; clarity, readability, and expressiveness, all of which are essential goals. *Style<br>&gt; is substance*. Half the battle is getting the computer to follow the<br>&gt; correct instructions. The other half is making the code readable so that<br>&gt; human beings can understand it - and that is a matter of style.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; There are times where I will choose to use a &#39;continue&#39; statement inside a<br>&gt; for...in loop. The reason hardly ever has anything to do with functionality<br>&gt; - I could design the code differently to avoid that particular code smell<br>&gt; if I put my mind to it. No, I would choose the &#39;continue&#39; statement because<br>&gt; in that particular context it makes my code more accessible to human beings<br>&gt; (including myself, later on). The ability to choose one solution over<br>&gt; another for purely stylistic reasons means that I can maximize both the<br>&gt; functionality and the readability of my code.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This proposal prevents the programmer from writing the best possible code<br>&gt; because it disallows a stylistic choice that improves readability. I don&#39;t<br>&gt; like that. It means that I have to write code that is worse than it has to<br>&gt; be. It means that I have to write code that is uglier and more disjointed<br>&gt; than it needs to be. That doesn&#39;t make any sense at all.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; You made a very strong claim: use of `guard...continue` leads to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;smelly&#39; code, or in other words bad code. In other words, you claim that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `guard...continue` is harmful. That is grounds for removal, and if you<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believe it to be true, I encourage you to propose it to the list and get<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feedback on that opinion.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you&#39;re saying that you simply don&#39;t prefer it for reasons of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;style,&#39; again I emphasize that the topic at hand here is not about<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; personal coding style. The claim we are making is that `where` is harmful.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I too like it for style, and I&#39;ll be sad to see it go. But I have concluded<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that it must go.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is also a big difference between &#39;break&#39; and &#39;continue&#39;. I am<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not afraid to use &#39;break&#39;, and I don&#39;t consider it a code smell. It allows<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for early exit from a loop based on conditions that are not always known at<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the time the loop is entered. for...in loops are necessary precisely<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because they allow for the early exit.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You don&#39;t need for...in if you want to continue - you can use forEach<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for that. Instead of using &#39;continue&#39;, you just use &#39;return&#39; without doing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything and it moves on to the next iteration. So really, the only purpose<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that for...in serves that is not served by forEach is early exit. But<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regardless, *even if for...in served no additional purpose that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; couldn&#39;t be served by forEach, I would keep it in the language because<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there are situations where I believe it is easier to read, and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expressiveness and clarity are important to me.*<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 10:55 Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 10:44 AM, let var go &lt;letvargo at gmail.com&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think we must be reading different discussions.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What I have seen in this discussion is the following:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a) The need to filter a for-in loop doesn&#39;t arise that often; but,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; b) When it does arise, everyone who has chimed in on this thread<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (except the two people who are proposing the change) thinks that the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;where&quot; clause is the clearest, most expressive way to do it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Something that would help me get on board with this change is more<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence about what kind of problems it is actually creating.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As best I can tell, this proposal got started because &quot;somewhere&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some new programmers (no one knows how many) expressed some confusion (no<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one knows how seriously they were confused, or how long it took them to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; figure it out) about how the where clause worked in a for-in loop. For all<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we know, once they learned the way it works, they may have said, &quot;Hey<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that&#39;s cool! I&#39;m gonna use that from now on!&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words, you seem to be talking about removing a feature<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that is liked by *a lot* people, based on some unsubstantiated reports of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; user error that may or may not have been totally unsubstantial.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t want new programmers to be confused, either, but the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;where&quot; clause is such a basic programming construct - the keyword is new,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but the idea itself is as old as programming - that I don&#39;t mind expecting<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new programmers to learn how to use it. The learning curve should be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; incredibly short - it is nothing more than a filter operation.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#39;s something else here that is really important to me, though<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know how others feel about it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using the guard...continue approach that you are promoting is a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; code smell. It puts control-flow logic inside the for-in loop. That is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something I have always tried to avoid. I know that the language allows for<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it, but I believe it is bad programming practice. In fact, if you get rid<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the `where` keyword, I&#39;m still not going to use guard...continue. I&#39;ll<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just filter the collection first and then loop it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is quite the statement. It sounds like you&#39;d be for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elimination of `continue`?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a code smell for the same reason that messing with the index<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inside a for;; loop was a code smell. I was always taught never to do this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for var i = 0; i &lt; array.count, i++ {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   if iWantThisToLoopAnExtraTime {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     i--<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why? Because code like that is confusing. It becomes difficult to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know how many times the loop will execute, what the looping logic is, etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, I might get away with it most of the time, but it is bad practice and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there is always a better way to do what you want to do. The only thing that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keeps you from the better way is laziness.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The same is true (albeit to a lesser degree) for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; guard...continue. It may not be as extreme, but it is still a code smell.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It divides the control-flow logic into two parts - one outside the loop,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and one inside the loop, and it suddenly becomes twice as easy to miss<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using for-in-where, all of the control-flow logic is on one single<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; line, and once it is known that &quot;where&quot; operates as a filter operation, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all works together in a single, harmonious statement that declares exactly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what is going to happen in a way that is totally unambiguous.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So by getting rid of the &quot;where&quot; clause, I believe that you are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually encouraging bad programming practice. Instead of encouraging the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new user to learn this very simple construct that will ultimately make<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their code safer and more expressive without dividing their control-flow<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; logic unnecessarily into two separate parts, you are encouraging them to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just &quot;do what they know&quot;. I think that is terrible, and you are doing them<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a disservice.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And from a personal standpoint, you are telling me that I have to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write smelly code, even though there is this perfectly good non-smelly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; option sitting right there, because you don&#39;t want someone else to have to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learn something.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 5:29 AM Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this discussion has made it pretty plain that what is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claimed to be &#39;so useful&#39; is barely ever used.

I didn&#39;t have any<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trouble with it at all. It follows one of the most basic programming<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; patterns ever: &quot;For all x in X, if predicate P is true, do something.&quot; The<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use of the keyword &quot;where&quot; makes perfect sense in that context, and when I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read it out loud, it sounds natural: &quot;For all x in X where P, do<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something.&quot; That is an elegant, succinct, and clear way of stating exactly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what I want my program to do.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t doubt that it has caused some confusion for some people,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but I&#39;m not sold that that is a good enough reason to get rid of it. It<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seems strange to get rid of a tool because not everyone understands how to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use it immediately, without ever having to ask a single question. As long<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as its not a dangerous tool (and it isn&#39;t), then keep it in the workshop<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for those times when it comes in handy.

It&#39;s more like, &quot;Does<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this work like X, or does this work like Y? Let&#39;s see...oh, it works like<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; X. Ok.&quot; That&#39;s the entire learning curve...about 5 seconds of curiosity<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; followed by the blissful feeling of resolution.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, Jun 10, 2016 at 9:32 AM Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, Jun 10, 2016 at 11:23 AM, Sean Heber via swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; And to follow-up to myself once again, I went to my &quot;Cool 3rd<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Party Swift Repos&quot; folder and did the same search.

My own Swift projects (not on Github :P) use “where”<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all the time with for loops. I really like it and think it reads *and*<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; writes far better as well as makes for nicer one-liners. In one project, by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rough count, I have about 20 that use “where” vs. 40 in that same project<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not using “where”.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In another smaller test project, there are only 10 for loops,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but even so one still managed to use where.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not a lot of data without looking at even more projects, I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; admit, but this seems to suggest that the usage of “where” is going to be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very developer-dependent. Perhaps there’s some factor of prior background<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at work here?

I know that the language allows for it, but I<br>&gt;&gt; believe it is bad programming practice. In fact, if you get rid of the<br>&gt;&gt; `where` keyword, I&#39;m still not going to use guard...continue. I&#39;ll just<br>&gt;&gt; filter the collection first and then loop it.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This is quite the statement. It sounds like you&#39;d be for the elimination<br>&gt; of `continue`?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; It is a code smell for the same reason that messing with the index inside<br>&gt;&gt; a for;; loop was a code smell.

Because code like that is confusing. It becomes difficult to know<br>&gt;&gt; how many times the loop will execute, what the looping logic is, etc. Sure,<br>&gt;&gt; I might get away with it most of the time, but it is bad practice and there<br>&gt;&gt; is always a better way to do what you want to do. The only thing that keeps<br>&gt;&gt; you from the better way is laziness.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The same is true (albeit to a lesser degree) for the guard...continue. It<br>&gt;&gt; may not be as extreme, but it is still a code smell. It divides the<br>&gt;&gt; control-flow logic into two parts - one outside the loop, and one inside<br>&gt;&gt; the loop, and it suddenly becomes twice as easy to miss something.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Using for-in-where, all of the control-flow logic is on one single line,<br>&gt;&gt; and once it is known that &quot;where&quot; operates as a filter operation, it all<br>&gt;&gt; works together in a single, harmonious statement that declares exactly what<br>&gt;&gt; is going to happen in a way that is totally unambiguous.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; So by getting rid of the &quot;where&quot; clause, I believe that you are actually<br>&gt;&gt; encouraging bad programming practice.

It follows one of the most basic programming patterns ever:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;For all x in X, if predicate P is true, do something.&quot; The use of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keyword &quot;where&quot; makes perfect sense in that context, and when I read it out<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; loud, it sounds natural: &quot;For all x in X where P, do something.&quot; That is an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elegant, succinct, and clear way of stating exactly what I want my program<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t doubt that it has caused some confusion for some people, but<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sold that that is a good enough reason to get rid of it. It seems<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; strange to get rid of a tool because not everyone understands how to use it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; immediately, without ever having to ask a single question. As long as its<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not a dangerous tool (and it isn&#39;t), then keep it in the workshop for those<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; times when it comes in handy. And even if there is some initial confusion,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it doesn&#39;t sound like it lasted that long. It&#39;s more like, &quot;Does this work<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like X, or does this work like Y? Let&#39;s see...oh, it works like X. Ok.&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That&#39;s the entire learning curve...about 5 seconds of curiosity followed by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the blissful feeling of resolution.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, Jun 10, 2016 at 9:32 AM Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, Jun 10, 2016 at 11:23 AM, Sean Heber via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; And to follow-up to myself once again, I went to my &quot;Cool 3rd Party<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift Repos&quot; folder and did the same search. Among the 15 repos in that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; folder, a joint search returned about 650 hits on for-in (again with some<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; false positives) and not a single for-in-while use.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Weird. My own Swift projects (not on Github :P) use “where” all the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time with for loops. I really like it and think it reads *and* writes far<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better as well as makes for nicer one-liners. In one project, by rough<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; count, I have about 20 that use “where” vs. 40 in that same project not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using “where”.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In another smaller test project, there are only 10 for loops, but<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; even so one still managed to use where.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not a lot of data without looking at even more projects, I admit,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but this seems to suggest that the usage of “where” is going to be very<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; developer-dependent. Perhaps there’s some factor of prior background at<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work here? (I’ve done a lot of SQL in another life, for example.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is worrying if true, because it suggests that it&#39;s enabling<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;dialects&#39; of Swift, an explicit anti-goal of the language.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I feel like “where” is a more declarative construct and that we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should be encouraging that way of thinking in general. When using it, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feels like “magic” for some reason - even though there’s nothing special<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about it.

For all we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know, once they learned the way it works, they may have said, &quot;Hey that&#39;s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cool! I&#39;m gonna use that from now on!&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words, you seem to be talking about removing a feature that is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; liked by *a lot* people, based on some unsubstantiated reports of user<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; error that may or may not have been totally unsubstantial.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t want new programmers to be confused, either, but the &quot;where&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clause is such a basic programming construct - the keyword is new, but the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; idea itself is as old as programming - that I don&#39;t mind expecting new<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programmers to learn how to use it. The learning curve should be incredibly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; short - it is nothing more than a filter operation.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#39;s something else here that is really important to me, though I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know how others feel about it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using the guard...continue approach that you are promoting is a code<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; smell. It puts control-flow logic inside the for-in loop. That is something<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have always tried to avoid. I know that the language allows for it, but I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believe it is bad programming practice. In fact, if you get rid of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `where` keyword, I&#39;m still not going to use guard...continue. I&#39;ll just<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; filter the collection first and then loop it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This is quite the statement. It sounds like you&#39;d be for the elimination<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; of `continue`?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a code smell for the same reason that messing with the index<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inside a for;; loop was a code smell. I was always taught never to do this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for var i = 0; i &lt; array.count, i++ {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   if iWantThisToLoopAnExtraTime {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     i--<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why? Because code like that is confusing. It becomes difficult to know<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how many times the loop will execute, what the looping logic is, etc. Sure,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I might get away with it most of the time, but it is bad practice and there<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is always a better way to do what you want to do. The only thing that keeps<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you from the better way is laziness.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The same is true (albeit to a lesser degree) for the guard...continue.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It may not be as extreme, but it is still a code smell. It divides the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; control-flow logic into two parts - one outside the loop, and one inside<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the loop, and it suddenly becomes twice as easy to miss something.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using for-in-where, all of the control-flow logic is on one single<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; line, and once it is known that &quot;where&quot; operates as a filter operation, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all works together in a single, harmonious statement that declares exactly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what is going to happen in a way that is totally unambiguous.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So by getting rid of the &quot;where&quot; clause, I believe that you are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually encouraging bad programming practice. Instead of encouraging the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new user to learn this very simple construct that will ultimately make<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their code safer and more expressive without dividing their control-flow<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; logic unnecessarily into two separate parts, you are encouraging them to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just &quot;do what they know&quot;. I think that is terrible, and you are doing them<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a disservice.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And from a personal standpoint, you are telling me that I have to write<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; smelly code, even though there is this perfectly good non-smelly option<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sitting right there, because you don&#39;t want someone else to have to learn<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 5:29 AM Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this discussion has made it pretty plain that what is claimed<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be &#39;so useful&#39; is barely ever used.

For all we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know, once they learned the way it works, they may have said, &quot;Hey that&#39;s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cool! I&#39;m gonna use that from now on!&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words, you seem to be talking about removing a feature that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is liked by *a lot* people, based on some unsubstantiated reports of user<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; error that may or may not have been totally unsubstantial.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t want new programmers to be confused, either, but the &quot;where&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clause is such a basic programming construct - the keyword is new, but the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; idea itself is as old as programming - that I don&#39;t mind expecting new<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programmers to learn how to use it. The learning curve should be incredibly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; short - it is nothing more than a filter operation.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#39;s something else here that is really important to me, though I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know how others feel about it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using the guard...continue approach that you are promoting is a code<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; smell. It puts control-flow logic inside the for-in loop. That is something<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have always tried to avoid. I know that the language allows for it, but I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believe it is bad programming practice. In fact, if you get rid of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `where` keyword, I&#39;m still not going to use guard...continue. I&#39;ll just<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; filter the collection first and then loop it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is quite the statement. It sounds like you&#39;d be for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elimination of `continue`?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a code smell for the same reason that messing with the index<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inside a for;; loop was a code smell. I was always taught never to do this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for var i = 0; i &lt; array.count, i++ {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   if iWantThisToLoopAnExtraTime {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     i--<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why? Because code like that is confusing. It becomes difficult to know<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how many times the loop will execute, what the looping logic is, etc. Sure,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I might get away with it most of the time, but it is bad practice and there<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is always a better way to do what you want to do. The only thing that keeps<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you from the better way is laziness.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The same is true (albeit to a lesser degree) for the guard...continue.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It may not be as extreme, but it is still a code smell. It divides the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; control-flow logic into two parts - one outside the loop, and one inside<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the loop, and it suddenly becomes twice as easy to miss something.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using for-in-where, all of the control-flow logic is on one single<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; line, and once it is known that &quot;where&quot; operates as a filter operation, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all works together in a single, harmonious statement that declares exactly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what is going to happen in a way that is totally unambiguous.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So by getting rid of the &quot;where&quot; clause, I believe that you are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually encouraging bad programming practice. Instead of encouraging the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new user to learn this very simple construct that will ultimately make<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their code safer and more expressive without dividing their control-flow<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; logic unnecessarily into two separate parts, you are encouraging them to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just &quot;do what they know&quot;. I think that is terrible, and you are doing them<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a disservice.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And from a personal standpoint, you are telling me that I have to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write smelly code, even though there is this perfectly good non-smelly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; option sitting right there, because you don&#39;t want someone else to have to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learn something.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 5:29 AM Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this discussion has made it pretty plain that what is claimed<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be &#39;so useful&#39; is barely ever used.

It follows one of the most basic programming patterns ever:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;For all x in X, if predicate P is true, do something.&quot; The use of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keyword &quot;where&quot; makes perfect sense in that context, and when I read it out<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; loud, it sounds natural: &quot;For all x in X where P, do something.&quot; That is an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elegant, succinct, and clear way of stating exactly what I want my program<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t doubt that it has caused some confusion for some people,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but I&#39;m not sold that that is a good enough reason to get rid of it.

And even if there is some initial<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; confusion, it doesn&#39;t sound like it lasted that long.

For all we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know, once they learned the way it works, they may have said, &quot;Hey that&#39;s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cool! I&#39;m gonna use that from now on!&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words, you seem to be talking about removing a feature that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is liked by *a lot* people, based on some unsubstantiated reports of user<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; error that may or may not have been totally unsubstantial.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t want new programmers to be confused, either, but the &quot;where&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clause is such a basic programming construct - the keyword is new, but the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; idea itself is as old as programming - that I don&#39;t mind expecting new<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programmers to learn how to use it. The learning curve should be incredibly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; short - it is nothing more than a filter operation.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#39;s something else here that is really important to me, though I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know how others feel about it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using the guard...continue approach that you are promoting is a code<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; smell. It puts control-flow logic inside the for-in loop. That is something<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have always tried to avoid. I know that the language allows for it, but I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believe it is bad programming practice. In fact, if you get rid of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `where` keyword, I&#39;m still not going to use guard...continue. I&#39;ll just<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; filter the collection first and then loop it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is quite the statement. It sounds like you&#39;d be for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elimination of `continue`?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a code smell for the same reason that messing with the index<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inside a for;; loop was a code smell. I was always taught never to do this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for var i = 0; i &lt; array.count, i++ {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   if iWantThisToLoopAnExtraTime {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     i--<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why? Because code like that is confusing. It becomes difficult to know<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how many times the loop will execute, what the looping logic is, etc. Sure,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I might get away with it most of the time, but it is bad practice and there<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is always a better way to do what you want to do. The only thing that keeps<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you from the better way is laziness.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The same is true (albeit to a lesser degree) for the guard...continue.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It may not be as extreme, but it is still a code smell. It divides the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; control-flow logic into two parts - one outside the loop, and one inside<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the loop, and it suddenly becomes twice as easy to miss something.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using for-in-where, all of the control-flow logic is on one single<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; line, and once it is known that &quot;where&quot; operates as a filter operation, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all works together in a single, harmonious statement that declares exactly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what is going to happen in a way that is totally unambiguous.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So by getting rid of the &quot;where&quot; clause, I believe that you are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually encouraging bad programming practice. Instead of encouraging the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new user to learn this very simple construct that will ultimately make<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their code safer and more expressive without dividing their control-flow<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; logic unnecessarily into two separate parts, you are encouraging them to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just &quot;do what they know&quot;. I think that is terrible, and you are doing them<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a disservice.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And from a personal standpoint, you are telling me that I have to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write smelly code, even though there is this perfectly good non-smelly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; option sitting right there, because you don&#39;t want someone else to have to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learn something.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 5:29 AM Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this discussion has made it pretty plain that what is claimed<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be &#39;so useful&#39; is barely ever used.

It follows one of the most basic programming patterns ever:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;For all x in X, if predicate P is true, do something.&quot; The use of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keyword &quot;where&quot; makes perfect sense in that context, and when I read it out<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; loud, it sounds natural: &quot;For all x in X where P, do something.&quot; That is an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elegant, succinct, and clear way of stating exactly what I want my program<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t doubt that it has caused some confusion for some people,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but I&#39;m not sold that that is a good enough reason to get rid of it.

And even if there is some initial<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; confusion, it doesn&#39;t sound like it lasted that long.

For all<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we know, once they learned the way it works, they may have said, &quot;Hey<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that&#39;s cool! I&#39;m gonna use that from now on!&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words, you seem to be talking about removing a feature that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is liked by *a lot* people, based on some unsubstantiated reports of user<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; error that may or may not have been totally unsubstantial.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t want new programmers to be confused, either, but the &quot;where&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clause is such a basic programming construct - the keyword is new, but the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; idea itself is as old as programming - that I don&#39;t mind expecting new<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programmers to learn how to use it. The learning curve should be incredibly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; short - it is nothing more than a filter operation.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#39;s something else here that is really important to me, though I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know how others feel about it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using the guard...continue approach that you are promoting is a code<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; smell. It puts control-flow logic inside the for-in loop. That is something<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have always tried to avoid. I know that the language allows for it, but I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believe it is bad programming practice. In fact, if you get rid of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `where` keyword, I&#39;m still not going to use guard...continue. I&#39;ll just<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; filter the collection first and then loop it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is quite the statement. It sounds like you&#39;d be for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elimination of `continue`?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a code smell for the same reason that messing with the index<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inside a for;; loop was a code smell. I was always taught never to do this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for var i = 0; i &lt; array.count, i++ {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   if iWantThisToLoopAnExtraTime {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     i--<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why? Because code like that is confusing. It becomes difficult to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know how many times the loop will execute, what the looping logic is, etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, I might get away with it most of the time, but it is bad practice and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there is always a better way to do what you want to do. The only thing that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keeps you from the better way is laziness.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The same is true (albeit to a lesser degree) for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; guard...continue. It may not be as extreme, but it is still a code smell.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It divides the control-flow logic into two parts - one outside the loop,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and one inside the loop, and it suddenly becomes twice as easy to miss<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using for-in-where, all of the control-flow logic is on one single<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; line, and once it is known that &quot;where&quot; operates as a filter operation, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all works together in a single, harmonious statement that declares exactly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what is going to happen in a way that is totally unambiguous.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So by getting rid of the &quot;where&quot; clause, I believe that you are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually encouraging bad programming practice. Instead of encouraging the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new user to learn this very simple construct that will ultimately make<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their code safer and more expressive without dividing their control-flow<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; logic unnecessarily into two separate parts, you are encouraging them to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just &quot;do what they know&quot;. I think that is terrible, and you are doing them<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a disservice.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And from a personal standpoint, you are telling me that I have to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write smelly code, even though there is this perfectly good non-smelly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; option sitting right there, because you don&#39;t want someone else to have to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learn something.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 13, 2016 at 5:29 AM Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this discussion has made it pretty plain that what is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claimed to be &#39;so useful&#39; is barely ever used.

As long<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as its not a dangerous tool (and it isn&#39;t), then keep it in the workshop<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for those times when it comes in handy.

I.e. <br>we even don&#39;t have any thoughts about what LINQ for Swift can look like, <br>and when we&#39;ll only start to discuss this(4.x? 5.x? 6.x?), but we <br>definitely needs to remove handful feature now and then keep the hope it <br>will return in more powerful way. Probably we need to be very close to <br>situation when &#39;where&#39; in &#39;for-in&#39; loop prevents introduction of LINQ-like <br>feature to remote this &#39;where&#39;? (probably with for-in loop together).<br></p><p>Again, we have sugar of `for-in` to be able to iterate <br>sequences&amp;collections in handy way, we need it only for this purpose. We <br>have &#39;where&#39; feature in &#39;for-in&#39; to be able to filter the iterating <br>sequence. Filtering is essential operation for sequences/collections <br>(.filter is one of main 3 operations : filter/map/reduce). As we have a <br>special sugar to iterate sequences I find it very logical to have in it a <br>sugar to filter iterated sequences. Force people to use guard-continue <br>instead of &#39;where&#39; for me is equal to force to use &#39;while&#39; loop to iterate <br>sequences instead of `for-in` loop.<br></p><p>Also, as was mentioned, in some situations you want to apply logically <br>&#39;main&#39; filter in &#39;where&#39; clause and then use guard-continue for additional <br>filters/checks in body.<br></p><p>And &#39;where&#39; in for-in loops does exist now in Swift. IMO you need really <br>strong arguments to remove it. I&#39;ve read all the messages of Xiaodi and <br>Erica(and others), and I didn&#39;t find any argument that clearly shows that <br>&#39;where&#39; is a bad thing and must be removed, I saw your opinions or your <br>view of Swift future or your understanding of Swift goals or your <br>understanding of core-team thoughts or your preferable style for coding etc.<br></p><p>If it is not clear if &#39;where&#39; has &#39;continue if fails&#39; behavior - IMO we <br>need to *rename* it. It is just not logically to remove the feature if <br>keyword is not clear enough(*for some beginners who see it the first time) <br>- make the keyword clear, then you have no main argument to remove the <br>_feature_.<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/36603be464733b58cc53cecd480eeae8?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Retiring `where` from for-in loops</strong> from <string>let var go</string> &lt;letvargo at gmail.com&gt;<p>June 13, 2016 at 03:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>I am 100% with Charlie on this.

This link illustrates the syntax for 28 languages’  comprehension constructs, so it isn’t a bad overview:<br></p><p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(list_comprehension)<br></p><p>…(note that “comprehension syntax” isn’t quite the same thing as “list comprehensions”, but for “comparative syntax” purposes that link should be sufficient).<br></p><p>For me the appeal of “comprehension syntax” is that it allows writing code that feels more “semantic” than “mechanical”, and that paraphrases much closer to the intended meaning.<br></p><p>Here’s a toy example:<br></p><p>  // with a comprehension-like syntax<br>  // outside loop: “what items do we care about?&quot;<br>  for visitor in queue where visitor.hasTicket until venue.isFull {<br>    // inside loop: “…and what do we do with them?&quot;<br>    venue.admit(visitor)<br>  }<br></p><p>…which to my eyes paraphrases more-or-less how I’d describe what we’re doing:<br></p><p>- “keep admitting visitors with tickets until the venue is full”<br></p><p>…whereas without it, you get something like this:<br></p><p>  // without comprehension-style syntax<br>  // outside loop: where, mechanically, are we sourcing items from<br>  for visitor in queue {<br>    // inside loop: muddled mix of filtering, app logic, and flow-control<br>    // filtering:<br>    guard visitor.hasTicket else { continue }<br>    // app logic:<br>    venue.admit(visitor)<br>    // flow-control:<br>    if venue.isFull { break }<br>  }<br></p><p>…which *is* closer to the underlying mechanics, but paraphrases more like something you&#39;d see in a badly-translated 80s VCR programing manual:<br></p><p>- “Start considering visitors. If the visitor doesn&#39;t have a ticket, move on to the next visitor. Otherwise, admit the visitor. If the venue is full, stop considering visitors.”<br></p><p>Sure, they’re both equivalent—and even in the 80s, some people managed to program their VCRs!—but given the option I’d strongly prefer to write in the first style; I like having a clean segregation between “what items are of interest?” and “what do we do with them?”<br></p><p>So that’s what I like about comprehension-like constructs.<br></p><p>The current `for-in-where` is a bit of an anomaly; it could be grown into something a little richer—`for _ in _ where _ while _`  and/or `for _ in _ where _ until _` (etc.).—or it could be dropped and some better construct proposed.<br></p><p>But, my personal preference would be to keep it around until either the richer construct is available or definitively declared as “not swift-y, not happening”: <br></p><p>- if a “comprehension” construct is approved, an automatic migrator would likely do a *much* better job translating those `for _ in _ where` loops than it’d do with their more-imperative equivalents<br>- if a “comprehension” construct is definitively-rejected, at least I can keep using something I like until the hammer drops<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; -- E<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5451f7df31d36d0159a018706aec7adb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Retiring `where` from for-in loops</strong> from <string>Erica Sadun</string> &lt;erica at ericasadun.com&gt;<p>June 14, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jun 14, 2016, at 7:50 AM, plx via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; For those particular keywords, I’d prefer having them (or equivalents).

This link<br>&gt; illustrates the syntax for 28 languages’  comprehension constructs, so it<br>&gt; isn’t a bad overview:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(list_comprehension)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; …(note that “comprehension syntax” isn’t quite the same thing as “list<br>&gt; comprehensions”, but for “comparative syntax” purposes that link should be<br>&gt; sufficient).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; For me the appeal of “comprehension syntax” is that it allows writing code<br>&gt; that feels more “semantic” than “mechanical”, and that paraphrases much<br>&gt; closer to the intended meaning.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Here’s a toy example:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   // with a comprehension-like syntax<br>&gt;   // outside loop: “what items do we care about?&quot;<br>&gt;   for visitor in queue where visitor.hasTicket until venue.isFull {<br>&gt;     // inside loop: “…and what do we do with them?&quot;<br>&gt;     venue.admit(visitor)<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; …which to my eyes paraphrases more-or-less how I’d describe what we’re<br>&gt; doing:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - “keep admitting visitors with tickets until the venue is full”<br>&gt;<br>&gt; …whereas without it, you get something like this:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   // without comprehension-style syntax<br>&gt;   // outside loop: where, mechanically, are we sourcing items from<br>&gt;   for visitor in queue {<br>&gt;     // inside loop: muddled mix of filtering, app logic, and flow-control<br>&gt;     // filtering:<br>&gt;     guard visitor.hasTicket else { continue }<br>&gt;     // app logic:<br>&gt;     venue.admit(visitor)<br>&gt;     // flow-control:<br>&gt;     if venue.isFull { break }<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; …which *is* closer to the underlying mechanics, but paraphrases more like<br>&gt; something you&#39;d see in a badly-translated 80s VCR programing manual:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - “Start considering visitors. If the visitor doesn&#39;t have a ticket, move<br>&gt; on to the next visitor. Otherwise, admit the visitor. If the venue is full,<br>&gt; stop considering visitors.”<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Sure, they’re both equivalent—and even in the 80s, some people managed to<br>&gt; program their VCRs!—but given the option I’d strongly prefer to write in<br>&gt; the first style; I like having a clean segregation between “what items are<br>&gt; of interest?” and “what do we do with them?”<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So that’s what I like about comprehension-like constructs.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The current `for-in-where` is a bit of an anomaly; it could be grown into<br>&gt; something a little richer—`for _ in _ where _ while _`  and/or `for _ in _<br>&gt; where _ until _` (etc.).—or it could be dropped and some better construct<br>&gt; proposed.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; But, my personal preference would be to keep it around until either the<br>&gt; richer construct is available or definitively declared as “not swift-y, not<br>&gt; happening”:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - if a “comprehension” construct is approved, an automatic migrator would<br>&gt; likely do a *much* better job translating those `for _ in _ where` loops<br>&gt; than it’d do with their more-imperative equivalents<br>&gt; - if a “comprehension” construct is definitively-rejected, at least I can<br>&gt; keep using something I like until the hammer drops<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; -- E<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; &gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; &gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160614/2b5f14d5/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/73a38bb7bc9528e31098defe30e68ea4?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Retiring `where` from for-in loops</strong> from <string>Jean-Daniel Dupas</string> &lt;mailing at xenonium.com&gt;<p>June 15, 2016 at 11:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Le 13 juin 2016 à 17:26, Erica Sadun via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jun 13, 2016, at 9:23 AM, let var go via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I am 100% with Charlie on this.

I think it’s premature to remove where from for loops until after the removal of where from conditionals has actually gone through and been in the wild some time, as it may well affect how confusing (or not) it is on for loops, plus it’d be nice to spend some time exploring other options like Jo’s, and Brent/Erica’s moving of the keyword, changes and/or additions to the keywords and so-on, which have been comparatively forgotten.<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ab486d7597af4cfe0be33a762150848?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Retiring `where` from for-in loops</strong> from <string>Dany St-Amant</string> &lt;dsa.mls at icloud.com&gt;<p>June 10, 2016 at 08:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Le 10 juin 2016 à 02:25, Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * The word &quot;where&quot; does not consistently imply `break` or `continue`.

I do as well. That does not mean it is clear to everyone.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I still have yet to see widespread confusion of this. A few people learning swift here or there, but once they learn the syntax...do they still find it confusing?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I expect some concrete data on stuff like this...especially with proposed syntax changes. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Without concrete examples, what would stop one from coming in here and waving their hands around to push *what they like* through?<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I know there&#39;s a linguist on the list, maybe he could comment on whether or not using &#39;where&#39; as a filter is proper or an abomination.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I do not think that because something is confusing to some, or at first, that it warrant removal from the language.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; It is a very bad sign if something is confusing at first, especially to a significant proportion of users.

If something is confusing rather than difficult (and the *concept* of filtering a list is not at all a difficult concept), and if the same underlying concept can already be invoked in alternative and equivalent ways that are not confusing, then it&#39;s a no-brainer that the confusing thing is harmful to the language and should be removed on that basis alone.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What is clear to one person may be confusing to another. There is no perfect syntax that will not make it confusing for some users. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; ----<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I really think it is important to come armed with more information with these proposals. It&#39;s easy to say a significant proportion of people are confused but it would make me much more comfortable to see this data to back it up. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; What if we are spinning our wheels for no reason on a feature that *most* don&#39;t find confusing? What if we make a bigger proportion of those who did understand it more confused now?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Brandon <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; By analogy, Chinese and Japanese share difficult writing systems. Yet many people use those languages daily without difficulty. Does that mean there&#39;s not a problem? Far from it: in fact, you&#39;ll find that many intelligent people have devoted their life&#39;s work to mitigating the issue.

We are proposing to simplify and rationalize the syntax by which filtering is invoked. If there were a way to dramatically simplify the syntax surrounding value types and reference types so as to diminish confusion, you can absolutely guarantee that there would be proposals to change the syntax.

Most of the times I used it in ifs, fors and switches I ended up thinking it hardened readability of my code (perhaps because of placement, but I do not think alternatives made it more readable) and so it was my decision to stop using where whenever possible in my code. Since Erica&#39;s performance test pointed out using guard is nearly as fast as using where and the core team is removing wheres from ifs, I think the ones in fors could go next.<br></p><p>L<br></p><p>&gt; On 10 Jun 2016, at 2:01 am, Charlie Monroe via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jun 9, 2016, at 7:16 PM, Erica Sadun &lt;erica at ericasadun.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 9, 2016, at 11:11 AM, Charlie Monroe &lt;charlie at charliemonroe.net&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; See my latest post - included results with -Ofast.

That can equally be handled by a `guard case` in the loop body.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Alternate proposal: Move `where` clauses to be adjacent to the pattern—rather than the sequence expression—in a `for` loop, just as they are in these other syntaxes.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	for n where n.isOdd in 1...1_000 { … }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; This makes them more consistent with the syntax in `switch` cases and `catch` statements, while also IMHO clarifying the role of the `where` clause as a filter on the elements seen by the loop.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I saw your post on that *after* I finished sending this. Moving `where` next to the pattern, like you&#39;d find in `catch` and switch `case`, the code would look like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; for i where i % 2 == 0 in sequence {<br>&gt;     // do stuff<br>&gt; }<br></p><p>What about just this?<br>for i % 2 == 0 in sequence { ... }<br></p><p>The first new identifier gets to be the index variable and subsequent new identifiers are errors.<br></p><p>- Dave Sweeris<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160614/8bf06e1c/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Retiring `where` from for-in loops</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>June 14, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; What about just this?<br>&gt; for i % 2 == 0 in sequence { ... }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The first new identifier gets to be the index variable and subsequent new identifiers are errors.<br></p><p>If that weren&#39;t a syntax error, I would expect it to loop over `[true, false, true, false, …]`.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
