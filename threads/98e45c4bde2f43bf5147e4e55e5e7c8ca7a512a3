The proposal has been *accepted*, with modifications:<br></p><p>* The core team agrees that we should rename all of the existing __FILE__, __LINE__, __COLUMN__, __FUNCTION__, and __DSO_HANDLE__ symbols to lowercase equivalents in the # namespace: #file, #line, #column, #function, #dsohandle.  This includes keeping __FUNCTION__, and making #line have the dual behavior of being a directive when it is the first token on a line, but an expression otherwise.  Renaming these symbols improves uniformity within the Swift language, and keeping all of them provides a smooth transition path from the old syntax to the new syntax.<br></p><p>* The core team isn’t thrilled with the magic “first token on a line” whitespace behavior that #line will be getting, and would like someone to start a discussion about renaming the old #line directive to something more specific and tailored to its purpose.   Once that name and syntax is settled, we can rename the directive and remove the whitespace rule.<br></p><p>* The core team requests that #symbol be split out into a separate proposal, because it needs more detailed design work, and is an additive feature.  For example, it might be appealing to provide a &quot;#mangledName” expression that provides the current symbol as a mangled name: when fed into a demangler, a more structured form of the current symbol would be available.<br></p><p>Thank you to Erica Sadun for driving this forward!<br></p><p>-Chris Lattner<br>Review Manager<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/attachments/20160203/98e412a3/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Accepted] SE-0028 Modernizing Swift&#39;s Debugging Identifiers (__LINE__, etc)</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>February  3, 2016 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Feb 3, 2016, at 4:39 PM, Chris Lattner &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Proposal Link: https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0028-modernizing-debug-identifiers.md &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0028-modernizing-debug-identifiers.md&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The review of SE-0028 &quot;Modernizing Swift&#39;s Debugging Identifiers&quot; ran from January 29… February 2, 2016.

In a getter, should it say the getter, or just the property?  In a closure within a getter, should it somehow indicate the closure, or just the getter?  etc.<br></p><p>&gt; * Will #context/#releasecontext/#debugcontext be split out to a separate proposal or dropped entirely?<br></p><p>I think they’d have to be separately motivated by a problem being solved, and being separate is good.<br></p><p>-Chris<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160203/880183ed/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/df65d69ec35e73390ddd0e6a2c335737?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Accepted] SE-0028 Modernizing Swift&#39;s Debugging Identifiers (__LINE__, etc)</strong> from <string>James Hillhouse IV</string> &lt;jimhillhouse at me.com&gt;<p>February  3, 2016 at 08:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>+Inf to Erica for this. <br></p><p>Jim<br>jimhillhouse at me.com<br>512-484-9489<br></p><p>&gt; On Feb 3, 2016, at 7:23 PM, Trent Nadeau via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Excellent.
