There is<br>&gt; an interesting network code in swift with these basics on the IBM swift<br>&gt; playground.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I wonder what kind of limitations are no longer relevant ?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And I found CocoaAsync very interesting to read because of the intensive<br>&gt; use of GCD<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And maybe it would be interesting to know who use what today with swift to<br>&gt; put a server or a client in use?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Regards<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Gérard<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Le 3 mai 2016 à 23:03, Jens Alfke &lt;jens at mooseyard.com&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On May 3, 2016, at 12:46 PM, Gerard Iglesias &lt;gerard_iglesias at me.com&gt;<br>&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A good reading<br>&gt;<br>&gt; https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This is highly Mac/iOS-specific code, so it doesn’t make sense for<br>&gt; applications targeted at servers.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Also, I’ve used CocoaAsyncSocket and it’s IMHO greatly overcomplicated for<br>&gt; what it does. There is a LOT of code in there, and a fair amount of the<br>&gt; complexity seems to be to work around obsolete limitations of iOS<br>&gt; networking that are no longer relevant.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; —Jens<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-users mailing list<br>&gt; swift-users at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-users<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br></p><p><br>-- <br>www.FareedQ.com<br>Twitter @IAmFareedQ<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20160509/285e4e3a/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
