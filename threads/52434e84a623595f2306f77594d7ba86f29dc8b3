I count three possibilities:<br></p><p>0. (original case…now works) My array is [MyProtocol]<br>1.  If my array is [SimpleStruct] (where SimpleStruct : MyProtocol) I get “‘MyProtocol’ is not convertible to ‘SimpleStruct’”<br>2.  If my array is [SubProtocol] (where SubProtocol : MyProtocol) I get “Type ‘MyProtocol’ does not conform to protocol ‘SubProtocol’”<br></p><p>I can work around #1 by duplicating my extension to CollectionType for both Element : MyProtocol *and* Element == MyProtocol, but that’s less than ideal. And I’m not sure if solving #2 is possible in this situation. (Unfortunately for me, #2 is actually what I’m trying to do in my app.)<br></p><p><br>&gt; On Apr 1, 2016, at 2:38 PM, Jason Sadler &lt;jason.sadler at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I should double check before I post.
