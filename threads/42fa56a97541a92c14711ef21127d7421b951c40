I also don’t feel comfortable adding it to my frameworks, since I<br>&gt; figure a lot of people are also adding something like this to their projects,<br>&gt; and I don’t want to cause a conflict with their version. Prime candidate for the<br>&gt; standard library.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I like calling it ‘mapValues&#39; as opposed to providing an override for map, since<br>&gt; it makes the specific behavior more clear. I would expect ‘map&#39; to possibly map<br>&gt; the keys as well (though there are issues where the new keys overlap). I suppose<br>&gt; you could just have a bunch of overrides for map if the compiler becomes good<br>&gt; enough at differentiating return types: (Value)-&gt;(Value), (Key,Value)-&gt;Value,<br>&gt; (Key, Value)-&gt;(Key,Value)<br></p><p>I agree that we need a way to do this, and was surprised when what I<br>tried didn&#39;t work.  This should work:<br></p><p>  Dictionary(d.lazy.map { (k, v) in (k, transform(v)) })<br></p><p>We should have a proposal that makes the constructor work* if we don&#39;t<br>already have one.<br></p><p>I&#39;m inclined against building specialized variants of basic algorithms<br>into particular collections, though.  Could be talked out of it if the<br>use-case is strong enough.<br></p><p>------<br></p><p>* Only question: does this need a label, e.g. <br></p><p>    Dictionary(uniquingKeys: d.lazy.map { (k, v) in (k, transform(v)) })<br></p><p>  to denote that it&#39;s lossy?<br>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
