As a<br>&gt;&gt; suffix, it perfectly communicates the difference between a mutating<br>&gt;&gt; and non-mutating version, and doesn&#39;t involve anything on the level<br>&gt;&gt; of gerunds, past participles, pluperfects, prozac, or anything like<br>&gt;&gt; that.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; -- E<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As for the immediate situation, I agree with this. InPlace feels<br>&gt; clunky, but it&#39;s the only naming-based solution I&#39;ve seen that clearly<br>&gt; communicates the semantics in all cases.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Jarod <br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/60dcb74d816e29b2aa6b9c0b5969670e?s=50"></div><header><strong>ed/ing, InPlace, Set/SetAlgebra naming resolution</strong> from <string>Xiaodi Wu</string> &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;<p>February 11, 2016 at 10:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Thu, Feb 11, 2016 at 7:31 PM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution<br>&lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; on Thu Feb 11 2016, Jarod Long &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Feb 11, 2016, at 15:20, Erica Sadun &lt;erica at ericasadun.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Feb 11, 2016, at 4:17 PM, Dave Abrahams<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;dabrahams at apple.com<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;mailto:dabrahams at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For the record, I do not feel at all confident anything like this will<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; end up in swift.

FWIW, if one believes in autocomplete, superscript<br>equal sign is already a valid identifier head character (per<br>documentation and experimentation in a playground). So, if the gist of<br>the proposal is acceptable, one can already name a pair of functions<br>union() and union=() if the &quot;=&quot; is replaced with its superscript (and<br>for that matter, =union(), but autocomplete might not help with that<br>one). Not sure this idea will gain too much traction, but if the union<br>operator ∪ is being thrown out as a possibility, I thought I&#39;d put it<br>out there.<br></p><p>In terms of symbols easily accessible on the keyboard not reserved for<br>operators, Xcode doesn&#39;t seem to complain about a function named<br>union$(), but that is a pretty bizarre-looking function name. More<br>horrifying than unioning() though?<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
