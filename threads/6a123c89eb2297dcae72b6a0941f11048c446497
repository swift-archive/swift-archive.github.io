I would want to be able to selectively catch errors based on<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; their type rather than having to look into the “reason” string to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; determine what happened. (In other words, the reason should be encoded<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; in the error type.)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Are you sure?  People often reflexively think they want strong static<br>&gt;&gt; typing in their errors, forgetting that error handling of the<br>&gt;&gt; throw/catch variety is fundamentally dynamically typed, effectively<br>&gt;&gt; introspecting the error at the catch site.  Think about the use cases.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Maybe we’re talking about two different things. I would typically want<br>&gt; to be able to catch errors selectively by pattern matching based on<br>&gt; their type, enum cases, etc.. I would not want to have to do a string<br>&gt; match on the “reason” property in order to find out what the error<br>&gt; was, as would be required with the Error struct that was proposed.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What approach are you suggesting?<br></p><p>Please allow me to withdraw my remark; I think I may have been<br>experiencing a brain outage.<br></p><p>Thanks for your understanding.<br></p><p>now-back-to-our-regularly-scheduled-bikeshed-ly y&#39;rs,<br>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
