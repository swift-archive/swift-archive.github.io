There are two ways to distinguish these:<br></p><p>* Does this method or function have side effects (which is what the current API approach intends to address); and<br>* Is this method or function inherently functional or procedural in nature, returning a value or not.<br></p><p>For example, contrast sort() and sortInPlace().  Even with the current approach they lack a natural clarity. You could easily swap <br>them without anything &quot;breaking&quot; in understanding because your solution is conventional, not based on any underlying principle.<br></p><p>With noun/verb naming, the function name reflects the functional/procedural underlying differentiation. <br>* A function produces something: f(x) -&gt; y. <br>* A procedure does something: g(x) -&gt; Void<br></p><p>Under my proposed change, the procedural variation would be sort, sortInPlace, etc. Optional adverbs and near-adverbs<br>could distinguish similar versions sortQuickly, sortBalanced, etc.<br></p><p>The functional would be sortedVersion or with a slight rule tweak that infers the subject of the action, sorted. The adjective modifies a noun, and <br>therefore implies the presence of a noun that is not explicitly added to the name.<br></p><p>I find my approach more principled and more obvious for use to non-native speakers.<br></p><p>Hopefully this clarifies.<br></p><p>-- E, finishing dinner and about to go on family time.
