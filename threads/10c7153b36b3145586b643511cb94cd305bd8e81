I just wish to mention here<br>&gt; that we&#39;ve experienced hangs in CI tests while connecting to some external<br>&gt; URLs in the past (you can see a few tests commented out in the current<br>&gt; TestNSURLSession for that reason).  It was then recommended, by Tony, that<br>&gt; we have a loopback server to test URLSession<br>&gt; &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/613&gt;. Having<br>&gt; said that, I can&#39;t be sure that the httpbin urls, that you use, will cause<br>&gt; the same issues :-)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Also, it&#39;d be great if you could file JIRA reports/PRs for the failures<br>&gt; you see.
