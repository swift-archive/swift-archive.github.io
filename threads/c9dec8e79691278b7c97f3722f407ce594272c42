Continuing:<br></p><p>Ah, thank you...<br></p><p>&gt; let content = listItemView.text.trimming(.whitespaceAndNewlines)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; For a beginning programmer, there is no indication of what .trimming<br>&gt; does.<br></p><p>It trims.  In this case, it trims whitespace and newlines.  I think<br>that&#39;s actually pretty clear.<br></p><p>&gt; In this case, it returns a new string instance. <br></p><p>That isn&#39;t what it *does*; that&#39;s the type it returns.<br></p><p>&gt; Where is that explained? In the documentation. Nowhere near the method<br>&gt; call.<br></p><p>Exactly.  You get this information from context.  If you take some text<br>and you trim off the whitespace and newlines, you get some other text.<br></p><p>I don&#39;t believe that teaching students that the name of a method is<br>going to supply all the relevant type information is doing them a<br>service.  This is *not* what they&#39;ll encounter in the real world,<br>not even if they&#39;re programming in Objective-C and using Cocoa.<br></p><p>&gt; So are we reduced now to looking up documentation just to read code? What<br>&gt; does this line do:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; let next = current.updating(p)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It&#39;s 100% unclear because you&#39;re relying on parameter names to contain all<br>&gt; the hints. <br></p><p>It&#39;s 75% unclear because there&#39;s no context.  I have no idea what<br>current or p are.  But I *can* tell (assuming this is following the<br>guidelines), that the method returns a modified version of current that<br>is obtained by updating p (whatever that means).<br></p><p>&gt; But this line:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; let next = current.locationByUpdatingProximity(p)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Lets you know that:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 1. we&#39;re returning a *&#39;location&#39;*<br>&gt; 2. &#39;*by* *updating&#39; *current with a new *&#39;proximity&#39;*<br></p><p>Under the proposed guidelines, that would be:<br></p><p>  let next = current.updatingProximityWith(p)<br></p><p>or<br></p><p>  let next = current.replacingProximityWith(p)<br></p><p>or<br></p><p>  let next = current.settingProximityTo(p)<br></p><p>&gt; When is the last time you saw a gerund (-ing) as a method name? <br></p><p>FWIW, these are not gerunds, they&#39;re present participles.<br></p><p>&gt; I wouldn&#39;t let my students write that. Gerunds make good boolean<br>&gt; properties. How would you even read the first line above out loud?<br>&gt; Probably by filling in the words in the second line, magically.<br></p><p>You&#39;re presuming that the guidelines as written would endorse that line,<br>but they don&#39;t.  Clarity at the point of use is the prime directive.<br></p><p>&gt; My second major issue is that autocomplete grouping is totally lost when<br>&gt; dropping the type returned at the beginning of the call. How many of us<br>&gt; learned a *ton* when we just autocompleted .stringBy? Look at all the<br>&gt; things you can do! But by removing the &#39;useless word&#39; (really don&#39;t like<br>&gt; that flag name) we have no grouping of constructor methods.<br></p><p>These things can be handled in other ways, e.g. by improving the tools,<br>without punishing readability at the use-site by adding needless words.<br></p><p>&gt; I see a lot of discussion on how to deal with &#39;with&#39; and &#39;by&#39; and other<br>&gt; words, but I want to strongly suggest that the current naming practices<br>&gt; provide context and clarity. It makes code readable and accessible. Don&#39;t<br>&gt; forget about when you didn&#39;t know how to code! These method names are<br>&gt; teaching tools!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Finally, I just want to ask: why? What is the great benefit? Shouldn&#39;t<br>&gt; clarity be prioritized over brevity (where have I seen that...)<br></p><p>It is.  You just have a different idea about what creates clarity in<br>source code.  IMO, clarity is provided by communicating semantics, *not*<br>by repeating non-semantic details such as which specific types are in<br>use.  By eliminating words that don&#39;t communicate semantics, you make<br>the semantics clearer.  If we didn&#39;t believe in this approach, Swift<br>wouldn&#39;t have type inference.<br></p><p>HTH,<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08045ad84066382b7a4d173e89302627?s=50"></div><header><strong>Issues with 0005-Better Translation of Objective-C APIs Into Swift</strong> from <string>Kevin Schlei</string> &lt;kevinschlei at gmail.com&gt;<p>February  3, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Tue, Feb 2, 2016 at 3:21 PM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; It trims.
