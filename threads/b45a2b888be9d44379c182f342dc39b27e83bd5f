The proposal is available here:<br></p><p>https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0077-operator-precedence.md<br>The previous version of the proposal that was reviewed can be seen here:<br></p><p>https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/40c2acad241106e1cfe697d0f75e1855dc9e96d5/proposals/0077-operator-precedence.md<br>with review discussion archived in this thread:<br></p><p>	https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160516/017879.html<br>Reviews are an important part of the Swift evolution process. All reviews should be sent to the swift-evolution mailing list at<br></p><p>	https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>or, if you would like to keep your feedback private, directly to the review manager. When replying, please try to keep the proposal link at the top of the message:<br></p><p>Proposal link:<br></p><p>https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0077-operator-precedence.md<br>Reply text<br></p><p>Other replies<br></p><p>What goes into a review?<br></p><p>The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review through constructive criticism and, eventually, determine the direction of Swift. When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br></p><p>What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>How much effort did you put into your review?

However, I really don’t like the names `strongerThan` and `weakerThan`.  As I mentioned in the discussion, we usually speak of “higher” and “lower” precedence.  IMO this implies that the appropriate names are “higherThan” and “lowerThan”, or if we prefer more concise single words, “above” and “below” (the latter is my personal preference).<br></p><p>&gt; Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>Yes.  Precedence values are a pragmatic but inelegant decision.  I will be glad to see them go.<br></p><p>&gt; Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>Yes, very much.<br>&gt; If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>This proposal will provide Swift with the most sophisticated operator mechanism of any language I am familiar with.  I do not know of anything quite like it.<br>&gt; How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>In depth study and participation in both discussions as well as the prior review.<br>&gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md&gt;<br>&gt; Thank you,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Joe<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160629/e86936a6/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bdd257c9369fb68e1d06923d10ff789e?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0077 v2: Improved operator declarations</strong> from <string>Ben Rimmington</string> &lt;me at benrimmington.com&gt;<p>July  3, 2016 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0077-operator-precedence.md&gt;<br></p><p>Alternatives:<br></p><p>	precedencegroup MultiplicativePrecedence : left where Self &gt; AdditivePrecedence<br></p><p>	precedencegroup MultiplicativePrecedence {<br>	    Self &gt; AdditivePrecedence<br>	    associativity : left<br>	}<br></p><p>-- Ben<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/969b04d28c02f951ccc03f615b9a92b3?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0077 v2: Improved operator declarations</strong> from <string>Dmitri Gribenko</string> &lt;gribozavr at gmail.com&gt;<p>July  7, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Proposal link:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0077-operator-precedence.md<br></p><p>Dave, Max and I discussed SE-0077 and reviewed the names of precedence<br>groups.<br>Here&#39;s our recommendation.<br></p><p>In general, we think some names don&#39;t read well and have some ambiguities,<br>for<br>example, &quot;LogicalAndPrecedence&quot; (looks like a conjunction),<br>&quot;AdditivePrecedence&quot; (&quot;additive&quot; is an adjective that modifies<br>&quot;precedence&quot;),<br>&quot;RangePrecedence&quot; (&quot;range&quot; is not an adjective, stands out).<br></p><p>We think that two directions would be fruitful:<br></p><p>1.

For example, we talk about &quot;nil coalescing&quot; operator.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Situation with namespacing is more intricate. I don&#39;t mind Precedence suffixes very much (better make keywords shorter), but it would be great if we came up with an elegant solution for dropping them.<br>&gt; One idea: add Precedence suffix automatically: &#39;precedence Additive&#39;, &#39;before: Additive&#39;, BUT &#39;Swift.AdditivePrecedence&#39;.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2016-07-07 19:28 GMT+03:00 Dmitri Gribenko via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;:<br>&gt; On Thu, Jul 7, 2016 at 9:27 AM, John McCall &lt;rjmccall at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt; On Jul 7, 2016, at 9:23 AM, Dmitri Gribenko via swift-evolution<br>&gt; &gt; &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Proposal link:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0077-operator-precedence.md<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Dave, Max and I discussed SE-0077 and reviewed the names of precedence<br>&gt; &gt; groups.<br>&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s our recommendation.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; In general, we think some names don&#39;t read well and have some ambiguities,<br>&gt; &gt; for<br>&gt; &gt; example, &quot;LogicalAndPrecedence&quot; (looks like a conjunction),<br>&gt; &gt; &quot;AdditivePrecedence&quot; (&quot;additive&quot; is an adjective that modifies<br>&gt; &gt; &quot;precedence&quot;),<br>&gt; &gt; &quot;RangePrecedence&quot; (&quot;range&quot; is not an adjective, stands out).<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; We think that two directions would be fruitful:<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 1.
