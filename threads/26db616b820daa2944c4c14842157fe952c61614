I use it in my code and I think it aids readability quite a bit. In the example:<br></p><p>for x in theArray where x % 2 == 1 { print (x) }<br>I think it’s artificially confusing because the print is on the same line. If we break the line we see the “where” at the end of the line and it reads like the English I would use to tell someone what this loop is doing:<br></p><p>for x in theArray where x % 2 == 1 {<br>... <br>To me this reads very clearly: I’m looping through some values BUT I want to skip some, now here’s what I’m going to do with these values. Using “guard” for this purpose adds unnecessary lines of code and also allows for the (common in my experience!) bug of accidentally using “break” or “return” inside the guard instead of “continue”. Also, guard / continue just doesn’t read like a filter.<br></p><p>Having the filtering/where logic (eg: what I’m _iterating_ over) separated from the body of the loop (eg: what i’m _doing_ to those objects) is one of my favorite things about Swift.<br></p><p>Yes, we could also do that with “filter” followed by “forEach”, but then it would read totally backwards and I don’t always want that. (I mean, at this point “for/in blah” could be considered syntactic sugar for &quot;blah.forEach {}” but I still want &quot;for/in&quot;.)<br></p><p><br>for x in theArray where x % 2 == 1 { print (x) }<br>while let x = anArray.popLast() where x % 2 == 1 { print(x) }<br>In this example case the “while” is only unclear to me because Swift has the odd thing where it does pattern matching using “let” as well as using let in a plain old assignment, and it’s hard to know which is which. I could argue that it’s also unclear why I can’t type “let x = anArray popLast where x % 2 == 1” by itself on a line and have x be an optional. (I would have liked it if we used “match” as a keyword instead of “let” when we’re doing patterns, but there you go.)<br></p><p>-Wil<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160623/26db1614/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5451f7df31d36d0159a018706aec7adb?s=50"></div><header><strong>SE-0105: Removing Where Clauses from For-In Loops</strong> from <string>Erica Sadun</string> &lt;erica at ericasadun.com&gt;<p>June 23, 2016 at 08:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jun 23, 2016, at 7:34 PM, William Shipley via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I’m against removing “where&quot; from “for/in”.

Number of divergent constructs<br>you have to parse. Here&#39;s the thing: I think it supports removal, not<br>retaining. Here&#39;s why:<br></p><p>For every loop you encounter, to understand its meaning you *must* look for<br>`break` and `continue` statements, and when they&#39;re inside `if` and `guard`<br>you must consider how the condition is evaluated. This is a given, a sunk<br>cost; I see no way they can be prohibited from the language, so these are<br>all things you will have to look for and mentally parse in order to<br>understand the behavior of a loop.<br></p><p>Now, if you add `where`, then that is one additional divergent construct<br>you must understand and parse. And moreover, since you know it exists, to<br>be sure you really understand what&#39;s going on you&#39;ll have to check the end<br>of every `for...in` statement to see if it&#39;s there. And in case the line<br>doesn&#39;t fit on your screen, you&#39;ll have to try scrolling to see if there&#39;s<br>more (or read on to the next line if you&#39;ve turned on line wrapping). And<br>you&#39;ll have to do this for *every* `for...in` loop, where the majority<br>don&#39;t use `where` at all!<br></p><p>So, I agree with you, what&#39;s important to me as well is number of divergent<br>constructs I have to parse.

What I&#39;m missing are more challenging real-world use-cases to justify <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the construct, and an exploration of why the challenging cases would not need debugger <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; support at that point.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My concern (and I am happy to be corrected) is that any code that becomes slightly more <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; complex loses the beauty and readability and hinders debugging at the same time.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; — E<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Here are two that are shipping right now. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; for (key, tile) in self._cache where tile.tintColor != self.tintColor { }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; for innerArray in actualValue where innerArray.contains(expectedElement) { }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Russ<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ----------<br>&gt; Tony Arnold<br>&gt; +61 411 268 532<br>&gt; http://thecocoabots.com/ &lt;http://thecocoabots.com/&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ABN: 14831833541<br>&gt; <br></p><p>----------<br>Tony Arnold<br>+61 411 268 532<br>http://thecocoabots.com/ &lt;http://thecocoabots.com/&gt;<br></p><p>ABN: 14831833541<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160628/0bbfa1bf/attachment-0001.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
