I have gotten it building successfully on Linux, unfortunately this required changes to build settings in other modules, because /usr/include/libxml2 wasn’t being added to the search locations. And this then results in needing to add “-I/usr/include/libxml2” to the command line any time you want to build anything using Foundation! (including just typing “import Foundation” in the REPL, heh). Which is obviously less than ideal. There is already an implementation for all this stuff in CoreFoundation, but it’s marked as being deprecated as of OS X 10.6, with a note to use NSXMLDocument (or libxml2) instead! Not exactly a helpful recommendation when you’re implementing NSXMLDocument heh. Should I just add wrappers in CFXMLInterface for the libxml2 functions I need? That might be the easiest way to just get everything building with minimal changes to other modules.<br></p><p>Thanks,<br>Robert Thompson<br>Software Engineer<br>WillowTree, Inc.®<br>willowtreeapps.com &lt;http://willowtreeapps.com/&gt;<br> <br></p><p>&gt; On Dec 18, 2015, at 8:05 PM, Philippe Hausler &lt;phausler at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Dealing with the cross platform part of the module map portion may be a bit tricky; I had to use some of libxml2 for CFXMLInterface it is effectively a simple wrapper around a few xml c calls that are a bit swift-friendlier.
