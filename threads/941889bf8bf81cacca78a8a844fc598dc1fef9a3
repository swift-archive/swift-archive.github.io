They don&#39;t recognize that there&#39;s a semantic restriction<br>&gt;&gt; (assume you can make only a single-pass!) on it, so they write libraries<br>&gt;&gt; of functions that may make multiple passes over Sequences.  They test<br>&gt;&gt; their libraries with the most commonly-available Sequences, e.g. Arrays<br>&gt;&gt; and Ranges, which happen to be multi-pass.  Their tests pass!  But their<br>&gt;&gt; constraints are wrong, their whole model of how to write generic code<br>&gt;&gt; over sequences is wrong, and some of their code is wrong.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This is a mistake that I see more often than I want to: designers of <br>&gt; development tools underestimate abilities of developers, and end up <br>&gt; restricting many of them.<br></p><p>In what way am I underestimating the abilities of developers?<br></p><p>&gt; My point is that we should impose minimal requirements on custom data<br>&gt; types. Quoting yourself:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; In this case, protocols used to interface with the language<br>&gt;&gt; at the lowest levels may be purely about syntax.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So there should be a protocol for building into for-in loops that <br>&gt; requires only that the sequence should be iterable once. Currently, we <br>&gt; have Sequence for that. If we remove destructive consumption from <br>&gt; Sequence, then there should be a super-protocol SinglePassSequence or <br>&gt; Forinable (excuse the pun).<br></p><p>Yes.<br></p><p>&gt; But even if we do this, I still don&#39;t understand the intentions. If a<br>&gt; Sequence is multi-pass, then we can satisfy requirements of<br>&gt; Collection, as already noted in the discussion. Why should we keep<br>&gt; Sequence at all, then? Then let&#39;s remove it and rename<br>&gt; SinglePassSequence to Sequence???<br></p><p>This kinds of decisions are all part of the discussion.<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
