As the author of a number of custom collection<br>implementations, including a rather elaborate B-tree package<br>(https://github.com/lorentey/BTree), it always felt strange to me that<br>indices are expected to be able to move around the collection on their<br>own, while element access has to go through by the collection. It is a<br>great idea to fix this asymmetry.<br></p><p>I’ll have to carefully read through it a couple more times and look at<br>the prototype branch to form a real opinion, but at first glance I<br>like the proposal. Here are a couple of quick thoughts, with more to<br>come once I had time to think about the implications in detail:<br></p><p>- I’m not at a great fan of the `*IndexType` protocols in Swift 2. I<br>  do not believe they work hard enough compared to how hard it is to<br>  implement them, and I welcome any change that makes them even a <br>  little bit simpler for the collection writer.<br></p><p>- Having to call a collection method to increment an index looks<br>  unnatural at first glance, but I can see myself getting used to it<br>  in a few hours.<br></p><p>- I know that it isn&#39;t a new requirement, but I do dislike that<br>  `Indexable` specifies the complexity of index operations; this puts<br>  a hard constraint on custom collection design. I do understand the<br>  desire for concrete complexity promises on operations using<br>  indexes, but can&#39;t we express these instead e.g. in terms of number<br>  of index accesses?<br></p><p>- I love that there is a section with detailed guidance on designing <br>  tree-based collections. It’s interesting and informative.<br></p><p>- My B-trees are persistent data structures, thus my nodes cannot have<br>  parent or sibling links. Index lookup and navigation is still O(1)<br>  though, as my indices contain pointers to every node on the path to<br>  the current element. Since I have to keep looking up these nodes<br>  anyway to retrieve elements and to navigate around in the tree, I<br>  simply decided to keep them directly in the index. B-trees are super<br>  shallow, so there are only a handful of nodes on any path.<br></p><p>- I found that the most straightforward place to implement tree<br>  navigation methods like `next(:)` and `advance(:by:)` is on the path<br>  struct that contains the actual node references. There is no reason<br>  I couldn&#39;t have the new collection methods simply call through to<br>  these path methods, though -- I am currently doing the same thing in<br>  the BTreeIndex type anyway.<br>  <br>- I&#39;m using weak references inside the index, with a (seriously<br>  underdeveloped) index invalidation method that happens to be closer<br>  to #2b than #2a. I&#39;m not happy about using weak references, but this<br>  seemed the most sensible thing to do. I&#39;d love to replace them with<br>  `unowned(unsafe)`, and the mutation counter seems like a great idea.<br>  The ARC issue mentioned at the end of the proposal is rather scary,<br>  though -- I don&#39;t know how I would protect against that.<br>  <br>  Generators/iterators look to be safe from this issue,<br>  so I’ll probably optimize their path representation first. <br></p><p>- For mutation, I think custom APIs often make much more sense<br>  than general-purpose solutions. I try to discourage use of the normal<br>  B-tree index for doing complex tree mutations, and I instead provide <br>  a cursor construct that was designed especially for performing <br>  a batch of mutations in a batch:<br></p><p>  https://github.com/lorentey/BTree/blob/master/Sources/BTreeCursor.swift#L295-L707 <br></p><p>  The cursor is like an index on steroids. It has an identity with<br>  mutable state on its own, and it takes unique ownership of the tree<br>  while it is active. This frees the cursor to disable some costly<br>  invariants (such as maintaining up-to-date descendant counts in each<br>  node). This in turn allows for convenient batch editing of elements<br>  in the tree, with amortized O(1) insertion and removal operations.<br></p><p>  The cursor&#39;s approach goes the exact opposite way of this proposal:<br>  not only is the collection not necessary to use the cursor, but the<br>  collection&#39;s value isn&#39;t even available while there is an active<br>  cursor on it. (This is like how<br>  `Array.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer()` works.)<br></p><p>- I&#39;m almost positive this has been discussed before, but what is the<br>  rationale behind allowing non-Int `IndexDistance`s? The distance is<br>  getting cast to Int in a lot of places anyway (IIRC, even the stdlib<br>  uses numericCasts to cut a way through it.)<br></p><p>    associatedtype IndexDistance : SignedIntegerType = Int<br></p><p>- The `Indices` associated type is intriguing. I assume it is brand new?<br>  It seems strange that it is allowed to hold a strong reference, but<br>  I’ll have to look through the prototype code to grok it.<br></p><p>  Superficial comment: I’m not too happy with the name. The irregular<br>  plural is hard on non-native English speakers, plus it seems weird<br>  to have both an `Index` and an `Indices` type. The `indices` property<br>  calls it `IndexRange` (I assume by accident); I think I like that <br>  name better.<br></p><p>- In this declaration:<br></p><p>    subscript(position: Index) -&gt; Generator.Element { get }<br></p><p>  I find the argument name rather unfortunate, because I&#39;ve been using<br>  the term &quot;position&quot; to consistently refer to the (numerical)<br>  position of an element in an ordered collection, which is typically<br>  not the same as the element&#39;s index. Could we just quietly rename<br>  this to `index` or `i`? :-)<br></p><p><br>&gt; On 2016-03-02, at 03:04, Dmitri Gribenko &lt;gribozavr at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hi,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We would like to propose a major change to how collection indices<br>&gt; work.

As the author of a number of custom collection<br>&gt; implementations, including a rather elaborate B-tree package<br>&gt; (https://github.com/lorentey/BTree), it always felt strange to me that<br>&gt; indices are expected to be able to move around the collection on their<br>&gt; own, while element access has to go through by the collection. It is a<br>&gt; great idea to fix this asymmetry.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I’ll have to carefully read through it a couple more times and look at<br>&gt; the prototype branch to form a real opinion, but at first glance I<br>&gt; like the proposal. Here are a couple of quick thoughts, with more to<br>&gt; come once I had time to think about the implications in detail:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - I’m not at a great fan of the `*IndexType` protocols in Swift 2. I<br>&gt;   do not believe they work hard enough compared to how hard it is to<br>&gt;   implement them, and I welcome any change that makes them even a<br>&gt;   little bit simpler for the collection writer.<br></p><p>Thank you!  I added your point to the proposal.<br></p><p>&gt; - Having to call a collection method to increment an index looks<br>&gt;   unnatural at first glance, but I can see myself getting used to it<br>&gt;   in a few hours.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - I know that it isn&#39;t a new requirement, but I do dislike that<br>&gt;   `Indexable` specifies the complexity of index operations; this puts<br>&gt;   a hard constraint on custom collection design. I do understand the<br>&gt;   desire for concrete complexity promises on operations using<br>&gt;   indexes, but can&#39;t we express these instead e.g. in terms of number<br>&gt;   of index accesses?<br></p><p>I think Dave answered this one.<br></p><p>&gt; - I love that there is a section with detailed guidance on designing<br>&gt;   tree-based collections. It’s interesting and informative.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - My B-trees are persistent data structures, thus my nodes cannot have<br>&gt;   parent or sibling links. Index lookup and navigation is still O(1)<br>&gt;   though, as my indices contain pointers to every node on the path to<br>&gt;   the current element.<br></p><p>Are these pointers unsafe pointers or ARC references?  If they are ARC<br>references, then we get extra retain/releases.  If they are unsafe<br>pointers, we need a safety check -- and I am interested to know what<br>was your approach to this.<br></p><p>&gt; - I found that the most straightforward place to implement tree<br>&gt;   navigation methods like `next(:)` and `advance(:by:)` is on the path<br>&gt;   struct that contains the actual node references. There is no reason<br>&gt;   I couldn&#39;t have the new collection methods simply call through to<br>&gt;   these path methods, though -- I am currently doing the same thing in<br>&gt;   the BTreeIndex type anyway.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - I&#39;m using weak references inside the index, with a (seriously<br>&gt;   underdeveloped) index invalidation method that happens to be closer<br>&gt;   to #2b than #2a. I&#39;m not happy about using weak references, but this<br>&gt;   seemed the most sensible thing to do. I&#39;d love to replace them with<br>&gt;   `unowned(unsafe)`, and the mutation counter seems like a great idea.<br>&gt;   The ARC issue mentioned at the end of the proposal is rather scary,<br>&gt;   though -- I don&#39;t know how I would protect against that.<br></p><p>Does your tree have in-place mutation?  (E.g., if a tree is uniquely<br>referenced, and there&#39;s only one live index, does tree[i] = 42<br>reallocate any nodes?)<br></p><p>I think the reasoning about unowned(safe) applies to weak references.<br>(The ARC issue.)<br></p><p>Fundamentally, the problem is that if you want an entity to be an<br>independent value, it has to hold strong references to all its<br>critical parts.  For example, an index can hold a weak reference to<br>something, but only if it does not care and continues to be fully<br>functional if that reference suddenly becomes nil.  But if a valid<br>index can&#39;t operate without a reference to collection&#39;s storage, it<br>has to be a strong reference.<br></p><p>You can replace a strong reference with an unsafe(unowned) reference,<br>but as an optimization, when it is possible to guarantee memory safety<br>by other means that are cheaper than ARC.  You should see no<br>functional difference between using a strong reference and<br>unsafe(unowned) + necessary safety checks.<br></p><p>&gt;   Generators/iterators look to be safe from this issue,<br>&gt;   so I’ll probably optimize their path representation first.<br></p><p>Generators/iterators are separate values.  So they should be<br>traversing a snapshot of the collection value.  Iterators shouldn&#39;t be<br>auto-updating with concurrent collection mutations.  For example, for<br>any collection implementation, this code terminates and appends<br>collection&#39;s elements to itself:<br></p><p>var c = getCollection()<br>for item in c {<br>  c.append(item)<br>}<br></p><p>Thus, iterators should be holding a strong reference to the<br>collection&#39;s storage, and make it non-uniquely referenced.<br></p><p>&gt; - For mutation, I think custom APIs often make much more sense<br>&gt;   than general-purpose solutions. I try to discourage use of the normal<br>&gt;   B-tree index for doing complex tree mutations, and I instead provide<br>&gt;   a cursor construct that was designed especially for performing<br>&gt;   a batch of mutations in a batch:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   https://github.com/lorentey/BTree/blob/master/Sources/BTreeCursor.swift#L295-L707<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   The cursor is like an index on steroids. It has an identity with<br>&gt;   mutable state on its own, and it takes unique ownership of the tree<br>&gt;   while it is active. This frees the cursor to disable some costly<br>&gt;   invariants (such as maintaining up-to-date descendant counts in each<br>&gt;   node). This in turn allows for convenient batch editing of elements<br>&gt;   in the tree, with amortized O(1) insertion and removal operations.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   The cursor&#39;s approach goes the exact opposite way of this proposal:<br>&gt;   not only is the collection not necessary to use the cursor, but the<br>&gt;   collection&#39;s value isn&#39;t even available while there is an active<br>&gt;   cursor on it. (This is like how<br>&gt;   `Array.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer()` works.)<br></p><p>That&#39;s a very powerful concept!<br></p><p>&gt; - I&#39;m almost positive this has been discussed before, but what is the<br>&gt;   rationale behind allowing non-Int `IndexDistance`s? The distance is<br>&gt;   getting cast to Int in a lot of places anyway (IIRC, even the stdlib<br>&gt;   uses numericCasts to cut a way through it.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     associatedtype IndexDistance : SignedIntegerType = Int<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - The `Indices` associated type is intriguing. I assume it is brand new?<br>&gt;   It seems strange that it is allowed to hold a strong reference, but<br>&gt;   I’ll have to look through the prototype code to grok it.<br></p><p>No, it is not new.  It is a special type for `var indices`, which is<br>the collection of indices.  This variable used to be typed as<br>`Range&lt;Index&gt;` -- basically wrapping a pair of indices.<br>`Range&lt;Index&gt;` won&#39;t be able to conform to Collection in this<br>proposal, since you can&#39;t increment all indices in isolation.<br>Therefore, in the general case, `var indices` has to capture<br>startIndex, endIndex and the collection itself.  In some cases (for<br>example, Array) it can be Range&lt;Index&gt;.  To allow using the cheapest<br>possible implementation, we are making the type of `var indices` an<br>associated type.<br></p><p>The reason why it needs to hold a strong reference is the same as why<br>generators need to hold a strong reference.  This index collection is<br>a separate value.  The value should be usable regardless of what<br>happens to other values.<br></p><p>Consider this example:<br></p><p>var c = getCollection()<br>for i in c.indices {<br>  print(i)<br>  c.append(c[i])<br>}<br></p><p>Imagine that `c` is uniquely referenced, and `c.indices` holds an<br>unowned reference to `c` that does not increase the reference count.<br>Then, when a new element is appended, the collection might need to<br>reallocate the storage.  The old storage will be deallocated.  When<br>`c.indices` needs to increment the index, it will try to access an<br>unowned reference that was deallocated, and the program will trap.<br></p><p>&gt;   Superficial comment: I’m not too happy with the name. The irregular<br>&gt;   plural is hard on non-native English speakers, plus it seems weird<br>&gt;   to have both an `Index` and an `Indices` type. The `indices` property<br>&gt;   calls it `IndexRange` (I assume by accident); I think I like that<br>&gt;   name better.<br></p><p>I&#39;ll let Dave answer this one :)<br></p><p>Dmitri<br></p><p>-- <br>main(i,j){for(i=2;;i++){for(j=2;j&lt;i;j++){if(!(i%j)){j=0;break;}}if<br>(j){printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,i);}}} /*Dmitri Gribenko &lt;gribozavr at gmail.com&gt;*/<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[RFC] New collections model: collections advance indices</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>March  2, 2016 at 01:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; We would like to propose a major change to how collection indices<br>&gt; work.

One thing that I<br>&gt; would want to understand is whether this non-linearity concept could<br>&gt; be added later without a re-design.<br></p><p>Sorry for the belated reply; I had to think for a bit about this one!<br></p><p>I’m not entirely sure, in part b/c I don’t have a ready-to-go alternative design to propose.<br></p><p>What I had in mind was to try and &quot;reserve room” for alternative indexing schemes to be added later without undue awkwardness.<br></p><p>However, when I went looking for real-world examples of such alternative indexing schemes it seems it’s just not something anyone actually does, and there’s probably a reason for that!<br></p><p>I think it’s possible to adjust the protocol hierarchy to “reserve room”—remove `Indexable`’s methods from `Collection`, add them back to a new `ForwardCollection` between `Collection` and `BidirectionalCollection`—but it’d only make sense to do that if you expect to have use for that room in the future.<br></p><p>&gt; Could you provide more information about the linearity issues that you<br>&gt; have in mind?  Are you thinking of something like Segmented Iterators<br>&gt; and Hierarchical Algorithms [1]?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; [1] http://lafstern.org/matt/segmented.pdf<br></p><p>That’s a neat paper! It also seems limited, insofar as it only demonstrated an improved implementation of `fill` (which is somewhat suggestive vis-a-vis the suspicions outlined above).<br></p><p>What I *was* thinking of was something generalizing the chapter on “Bifurcate Coordinates” in Stepanov’s “Elements of Programming” (this approach seems easily generalizable, but that doesn’t seem to have been taken up anywhere).<br></p><p>My thoughts were that as collections get stronger semantics, there’s an increasing disconnect between the semantics of the collection and the semantics of a “linear” index. Working up to it:<br></p><p>Arrays and array-like collections are truly “linear”, and are well-modeled by “linear” indices as-per the proposal; there’s a rich collection of generic algorithms that work on such collections and their indices, and it’s nice to have them in Swift.<br></p><p>Sets and dictionaries (and similar) are what I guess you could call “flat” (or “almost-linear”) collections: iteration aside, many index-based generic algorithms don’t work (particular mutating algorithms), and even where such algorithms *do work* it tends to be like this:<br></p><p>  let stringSet: Set&lt;String&gt; = [“a”, “b”, “c”, “d” ]<br>  let bPrefix = stringSet.prefixThrough(stringSet.indexOf(“b”)!)<br></p><p>…where the operation is *well-defined* but doesn’t have much to do with the semantics of `Set`.<br></p><p>Collections with even-stronger semantics (tree-shaped collections, order-maintaining collections, geometric collections, etc.) will likely have even further semantic disconnections!<br></p><p>As an example, one thing I’m working on is *basically* a “set&quot; of `(Value,CGRect)` pairs (with the rects possibly-overlapping each other); it keeps its contents organized so you can traverse its contents sorted by any combination of edge (north/south/east/west) and order (ascending/descending).<br></p><p>The way I have been structuring it is that each of those traversals is basically like this:<br></p><p>  extension CustomCollection {<br></p><p>    /// Returns a collection providing a specific, read-only, ordered “view” of the collection&#39;s contents.<br>    var byAscendingNorthernEdges: AscendingNorthernEdgeView { get }<br></p><p>  }<br></p><p>…and although I *did* make `CustomCollection` itself into a `CollectionType`, I can’t think of any scenario in which I’d ever intentionally want to use its `Index` for anything other than iteration.<br></p><p>Similarly, consider something like the tree-index situation vis-a-vis generic algorithms like `binarySearch`, `upperBound`, `lowerBound`, and `equalRange`:<br></p><p>- if the tree *isn’t* ordered-as-required the generic algorithms won’t work b/c the precondition isn’t being met<br>- if the tree *is* ordered-as-required the algorithms *will* work, but an implementation using linear-indices would likely be sub-optimal vis-a-vis implementations that exploit the tree-structure (start at root, follow appropriate branch, etc.) <br></p><p>…all of which leads me to wonder a bit about the general usefulness of such linear indices outside of iteration.<br></p><p>To be clear, there’s nothing in all of the above that has anything specifically to do with “Collections move Indices”; it’s all about potential future directions.<br></p><p>Even then, it seems like most other languages stick with what I’ve been calling a “linear” model and their “fancier&quot; collections *are* collections (as per their basic collection-API) and then use additional API to get at the “fancier” functionality, so it’s not clear there’s a real need to do different here.<br></p><p>&gt;
