(Some people find this confusing but it looks like this is stay in swift 3). <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This would...<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. equalize the conceptual behavior between access levels of an original type and the ones of their extensions.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. greatly reduce verbosity on members due to explicit access level modifiers.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. make it easier to modify the access level of an entire type, without requiring modification of individual members.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. reduce the requirement of public constructors where they would match the implicit ones.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. still allow exceptions on an individual level<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you think?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Regards,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Eric-Paul<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; --<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Notes:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * I&#39;m using the word &#39;entity&#39; to lump types and extensions together under one term. There must be a better term, please do share!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * My examples are based off of my experience with Swift 2.2, even though I believe the concepts still apply in 2.3 and the 3.0-beta.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Protocols don&#39;t allow access modification on individual members, of course, similar to an enum&#39;s cases.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Didn&#39;t find any similar topics in the [commonly rejected list](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/commonly_proposed.md)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * There&#39;s a [newly accepted proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md#proposed-solution) that adds `fileprivate` as a fourth access level modifier.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Other discussions about access levels, yet not what I was looking for:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * [Default access control / Access control blocks] (https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160328/013683.html)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * [Access modifier blocks] (https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160613/020968.html)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160722/9e5a42e0/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
