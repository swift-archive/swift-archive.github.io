I don’t know that it would be <br>&gt; everyone&#39;s first choice, but I think/hope it would be acceptable to the <br>&gt; vast majority.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Take a look here and let me know if you think it is worth flushing out:<br>&gt; https://gist.github.com/jonhull/a5ac84a16b7a0ffc0c00747998f390d9<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The basic idea (for those who hate clicking links) is to create 3 <br>&gt; levels of extensibility:<br>&gt; 	• Open -  The class or method is open to be extended through <br>&gt; subclassing/override.<br>&gt; 	• Sealed - Attempting to subclass/override the class/method will <br>&gt; result in a compiler error saying that it is not intended to be <br>&gt; extended. Using the ‘unsafe&#39; keyword will allow compilation.<br>&gt; 	• Final - The class or method can not be subclassed/overridden. <br>&gt; Attempting to do so will result in a compiler error.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; These would be orthogonal to access modifiers.  Thus you would write <br>&gt; ‘public open’, which is admittedly two words… but together they are <br>&gt; actually shorter than the single ‘subclassable’ keyword<br>&gt; <br>&gt; You can also specify different levels of extensibility at different <br>&gt; levels of visibility (e.g. ‘public final internal(open)’)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The default would be ‘sealed internal(open)’ which means it is publicly <br>&gt; sealed, but open within the defining module.  This is similar to the <br>&gt; default of 0117, except it allows overriding using the ‘unsafe’ keyword <br>&gt; (where the user explicitly acknowledges that subclassing/overriding is <br>&gt; not supported by the API).<br></p><p>It seems to me adding such an escape hatch makes the entire point of <br>the proposal moot.<br></p><p>If I say a class I define is internal or private, you have no business <br>poking at it from an external module; if I say my class is sealed or <br>final, you have no business subclassing it from an external module. <br>Swift provides no escape hatch that exposes internal components of a <br>module; I don&#39;t see why subclassibility requirements should be treated <br>otherwise.<br></p><p>Note that most popular OOP languages provide well-known patterns for <br>creating sealed but public classes, where only the author is able to <br>create subclasses. These patterns typically involve hiding class <br>constructors from external modules. If Swift was changed to support <br>sealed classes the same way, would you then propose a language feature <br>to defeat access modifiers?<br></p><p>&gt; Thus, we lose some compiler optimizations in the default case (vs <br>&gt; 0117), but these can easily be regained by explicitly marking parts of <br>&gt; the API as final.  The semantic meaning of the 0117 default is kept, <br>&gt; with an escape hatch for problematic API.  Thoughtful framework writers <br>&gt; would go through and mark API as either ‘public open’ or ‘public <br>&gt; final’.  Less thoughtful framework authors would still get feedback <br>&gt; asking them to do so, since nobody likes having the word ‘unsafe’ in <br>&gt; their code when they don’t have to.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This design feels much Swiftier™ to me because it has opt-out safety <br>&gt; and opt-in risk.  It protects you from accidentally causing trouble, <br>&gt; but gets out of your way when you tell it you know what you are doing.<br></p><p><br>-- <br>Károly<br>@lorentey<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
