I think, the question is how flexible one wants enum to be. Right now, Swift enums are nice for representing compact state, but they are quite awkward when trying to do more (e.g. complex recursive data structures with polymorphic behavior). This might be by design,  or this could be simply because enums are still incomplete. Extending enum functionality would effectively make then another alternative to class hierarchies/protocols, only that in the enum case the polymorphic structure is constrained initially. I think it might make sense for enum to be used to implement highly specialised polymorphic data structures, but its more a question of language design. It would be fine in my book if one said ‘no, we really don’t want enums to be that powerful use protocols/structs or classes for complex cases like that’.<br></p><p>This is something where I’d like to have more input from the core team, how do they envision the enum future?<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; I think that there would need to exist some restrictions on how methods could be broken up.

As you may recall, accessors are a way to specify a method (or, perhaps, a computed property) that can be implemented by the property to customize the behavior; accessors are implemented in a curly-bracket-enclosed block attached to the property. In property behaviors, they look something like this:<br></p><p>	var behavior getObserver&lt;Value&gt;: Value {<br>		accessor func willGet() {}<br>		accessor func didGet() {}<br>		<br>		var value: Value<br>		<br>		get {<br>			willGet()<br>			let v = value<br>			didGet()<br>			return v<br>		}<br>		set {<br>			value = newValue<br>		}<br>		...<br>	}<br>	<br>	@getObserver var x: Int {<br>		willGet { print(&quot;Getting x&quot;) }<br>	} <br></p><p>Using the same mechanism in enums might remove the redundant boilerplate caused by redeclaring the same methods in every case, and also reduce the appearance that cases are types. Your example might look like:<br></p><p>	enum MyTree {<br>		mutating accessor func insert(value: T)<br>		<br>		case Leaf1(Float, Float) {<br>			insert {<br>				…<br>			}<br>		}<br>		case Parent1(Int, Float) {<br>			insert {<br>				…<br>			}<br>		}<br>		default {<br>			insert {<br>				…<br>			}<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>Or, to use my example:<br></p><p>	enum Suit: Int {<br>		accessor var isRed: Bool { get }<br>		accessor var description: String { get }<br>		<br>		case hearts {<br>			description { return &quot;♥️&quot; }<br>			isRed { return true }<br>		}<br>		case spades {<br>			description { return  &quot;♠️&quot; }<br>		}<br>		case diamonds {<br>			description { return  &quot;♦️&quot; }<br>			isRed { return true }<br>		}<br>		case clubs {<br>			description { return  &quot;♣️&quot; }<br>		}<br>		default {<br>			isRed { return false }<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
