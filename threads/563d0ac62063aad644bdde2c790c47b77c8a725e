Especially when you have two Optional values to compare (as opposed to comparing an Optional with a non-Optional). `nil &lt; .some(x)` evaluating to true makes sense because it’s the logical way to define that operator if you’re trying to make Optionals comparable (and if we had conditional protocol conformances then I’d say Optional should in fact be Comparable), as the absence of a value would quite reasonably be considered to be less than the presence of a value, assuming that there is an ordered relationship at all. And there’s already precedent for “empty” values sorting less than all other values (namely, the empty string sorts less than all other strings).<br></p><p>As for optional comparisons making the code cleaner, I end up using them all over the place.
