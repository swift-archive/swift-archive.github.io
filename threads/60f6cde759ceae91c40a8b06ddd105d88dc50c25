I have the feeling that I will second-guess myself the next time.<br></p><p>IHMO, now that dorpFirst() is no-longer a free function, it&#39;s name is hardly distinguishable from .removeFirst(). When compared side-by-side, .dropFirst()  does seem to suggest “return the rest&quot;. But this subtlety is easily lost for users who don’t use both on regular bases. It’s worse for non-native English speakers.<br></p><p>Looking at a few other languages that provides a .dropFirst() for their list/array/sequence:<br></p><p>* Haskell’s “tail&quot; only makes sense when paired with “head&quot; (and not that self-explanatory). <br>* Rust doesn’t have a direct counterpart, but split_first() return both head and tail in a tuple.<br>* Scala and Ruby has a .drop(), but there’s no equivalent of .removeFirst() to cause confusion.<br></p><p><br>There must be a better name for this important method. I came up with:<br></p><p>.dropFirst() =&gt; .excludeFirst()<br></p><p>What do y’all think?<br></p><p>(Everything above applies to .dropLast())<br></p><p>- Daniel<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/283bdc6ec76dd4d16b7a8234222e55d4?s=50"></div><header><strong>rename dropFirst() and dropLast()</strong> from <string>Michel Fortin</string> &lt;michel.fortin at michelf.ca&gt;<p>December 28, 2015 at 06:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Le 28 déc. 2015 à 17:27, Daniel Duan via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; a écrit :<br></p><p>&gt; .dropFirst() =&gt; .excludeFirst()<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What do y’all think?<br></p><p>Following the new API guidelines, shouldn&#39;t the name be either `droppingFirst` or `excludingFirst`?

The guidelines do say it&#39;s acceptable to use an imperative verb if there is no good noun phrase, so &quot;skip&quot; and &quot;skipEnd&quot; (or &quot;skipLast&quot;, or maybe &quot;skipSuffix&quot; if we&#39;re keeping &quot;suffix&quot;) are still reasonable.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Incidentally, it occurs to me that &quot;removingFirst&quot; is actually not an appropriate name here, because dropFirst is a method of SequenceType, and SequenceType does not have mutating methods. removeFirst is actually defined by RangeReplaceableCollectionType (and by Set, and also by CollectionType if SubSequence == Self).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -Kevin Ballard<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Tue, Dec 29, 2015, at 11:55 AM, Daniel Duan wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Kevin,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “take&quot; and “skip” are fine as free function names.

And I&#39;m not aware of any language that sets precedent for the verb &quot;drop&quot; to mean &quot;mutate the receiver&quot;.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hmm, I just took a look, and while Rust does use &quot;take&quot;, it actually doesn&#39;t use &quot;drop&quot; (but Haskell does). Instead it uses &quot;skip&quot;, which seems like a good candidate if we&#39;re going to rename this. I&#39;m tempted to say we should use &quot;take&quot; instead of &quot;prefix&quot; as well, because `seq.prefix(3)` isn&#39;t actually immediately obvious what it does (as the verb &quot;prefix&quot; usually means to add onto the front, not to take the front). And we can use &quot;takeLast&quot; for &quot;suffix&quot; (neither Rust nor Haskell appears to have an equivalent of takeLast; I believe Rust doesn&#39;t because none of its iterator adaptors use dynamically-allocated memory, and I think Haskell expects you to just do `reverse . take n . reverse`). Although I do notice Haskell has a function dropWhileEnd that drops the suffix, which suggests &quot;takeEnd&quot; and &quot;dropEnd&quot; here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which is to say, if we&#39;re going to rename these methods, my vote is:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prefix -&gt; take<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suffix -&gt; takeEnd or takeLast<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dropFirst -&gt; skip<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dropLast -&gt; skipEnd or skipLast<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Kevin Ballard<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6451ee8093c9cedc94f6c813b4dde2c5?s=50"></div><header><strong>rename dropFirst() and dropLast()</strong> from <string>Kevin Ballard</string> &lt;kevin at sb.org&gt;<p>December 29, 2015 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Tue, Dec 29, 2015, at 01:33 PM, Daniel Duan wrote:<br>&gt; For concrete types that conform to CollectionType:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; [2, 1, 3].removeFirst()    // =&gt; 2<br>&gt; [2, 1, 3].removingFirst() // =&gt; [1, 3]<br>&gt; <br>&gt; seems like what the “non-mutating counterpart” guideline is aiming for.
