When we say<br>&gt;&gt; &quot;safe&quot; in Swift, we don&#39;t mean &quot;doesn&#39;t have side-effects;&quot; we mean<br>&gt;&gt; either type safety (not accessing initialized memory as a type it<br>&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t have) or memory safety (not accessing uninitialized memory).<br>&gt;&gt; Could you clarify what you mean?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Apologies, I omitted the definition of safe I was using when paring<br>&gt; down the email and didn’t notice (FYI, the original definition of safe<br>&gt; and idempotent came from HTTP).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I mean without *impacting* side effects. For value types this means<br>&gt; non-mutable, but not necessarily forbidding mutation of classes<br>&gt; (including ones referenced internally by the struct). This means that<br>&gt; any side effects are not visible from the API perspective.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On a separate reply of what I mean by this, I gave the example of<br>&gt; using a logging interface, or having a collection backed by a splay<br>&gt; tree (a data structure whose topology is modified on read).<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Once you have the safety aspect underway, usability and consistency<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; determine what stays as properties or gets promoted to methods.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Example: from a safety perspective, “reverse” and many other methods<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; could be getter property on CollectionType. However, they could not be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; properties on the super type SequenceType, because SequenceType is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; allowed to consume the underlying data. To have “reverse’ be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; consistent across both SequenceType and its subtype CollectionType, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; needs to be a method.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; underestimateCount() looks like it could be a property for safety, but<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; some other design/consistency aspects made it a method.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; This is useful, thanks!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yeah, once you qualify what can be a property by the basic level of<br>&gt; user expectation, there are other aspects (including complexity and<br>&gt; usage) that come into play when deciding between properties and<br>&gt; methods.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Count is a great example; with C-style for loops in the picture, it<br>&gt; was probable someone would call count in their comparison on each<br>&gt; loop, not realizing it backs a possibly O(n) operation. With C-style<br>&gt; loops gone, having count be a property is more easily justified.<br></p><p>Meh. I don&#39;t think <br></p><p>    while i &lt; x.count {<br>      ...<br>      ++i<br>    }<br></p><p>is any less likely than a C-style for loop was.<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
