We would keep the direct member access syntax and wrap the results of any dynamic member access expressions in an Optional, as opposed to an IUO. In practice this feels like a nice compromise that will prevent many users from shooting themselves in the foot, as changing the wrapping to optional forces users to immediately account for failures without having to jump through too many hoops.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thoughts?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks!<br>&gt; - Joe<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mar 23, 2016, at 12:45 PM, Joseph Pamer &lt;jpamer at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mar 23, 2016, at 11:29 AM, Jordan Rose &lt;jordan_rose at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The most common use case I&#39;ve seen for this has been drilling into a heterogeneous collection without specifying intermediate types, i.e. `pluginProperties[&quot;actions&quot;][0][&quot;name&quot;]`. Some possible variations on this proposal could continue to allow that:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - Remove all lookup except the subscripts `(AnyObject) -&gt; AnyObject?` and `(Int) -&gt; AnyObject`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - Instead of removing AnyObject lookup completely (the proposal), change the IUO-wrapped results (the current behavior) to use Optional, requiring developers to explicitly deal with the possibility of failure.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - Both of the above.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I know Joe Pamer has been looking into seeing how this feature is used by introducing a warning for it in the type checker. Before making any changes here we&#39;d want to know how it affects real-world projects.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I should be pushing a branch that does both of the above “real soon now”.

As in Objective-C, if you invoke a method or access a property that does not exist on an AnyObject typed object, it is a runtime error.”<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I propose that we remove this behavior entirely to push swift further in the direction of type safety.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rationale:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Even if you don’t mean to write code that relies on this behavior, it&#39;s easy to accidentally do so when interfacing with various Cocoa APIs due to type inference. A developer may not even realize that their code is unsafe since their code will compile just fine when calling obj-c visible methods. Removing this behavior would alleviate any confusion that a developer may have while writing this, especially as it is not a highly advertised feature of AnyObject.
