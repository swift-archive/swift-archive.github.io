With the existing behavior, such mistakes are immediately obvious as Objective-C receives an opaque object that it cannot use (and probably soon crashes), so they are unlikely to make it past QA testing. For many other cases, particularly when nil is encountered in an array only rarely, this is likely to cause strange and hard-to-debug problems at runtime when NSNull pops up where code wasn’t expecting it (which I would expect to be most Objective-C code), and it might not be detected until after the product ships. In this way, this proposal creates a problem very similar to the problem that Swift was trying to solve with optionals in the first place.<br></p><p>Gwynne brings up the interesting idea of being able to declare Objective-C array parameters as NSArray&lt;id _Nullable&gt;. If this were allowed, and the proposed bridging behavior were *only* invoked for an array so declared, I might soften on this proposal, but as is, I feel that it would be a very large mistake.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>A major feature of Swift was the concept of optionals, intended to prevent bugs caused by nil pointers showing up where they were not expected. This proposal flies directly in the face of that, and threatens to make it much easier to create bugs caused by NSNull objects showing up where they are not expected. In this way, I feel that it is an almost 180° contradiction of the feel and direction of Swift.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>The only Objective-C bridges I have used in other languages have been in AppleScript and JXA, neither of which I would expect Swift to use as a model.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• How much effort did you put into your review?

This will alert you right away to the fact that you accidentally sent an optional array to an Objective-C API. With this proposal, if the objects in the array are usually non-nil, you might never realize that you accidentally made the array optional, and you won’t find out until some weird edge case results in a nil getting stuck in there and then *surprise!* your users are reporting random crashes in your app that are really hard to track down!<br></p><p>Optional arrays are pretty easy to make by accident.

The thing is, if you’ve made one, you usually find out about it pretty quickly because you get compiler errors when passing it to other Swift APIs, and, in the worst case, instant and obvious runtime errors when passing it to Objective-C APIs. With the proposal, accidental optional arrays will suddenly become silent and deadly in Objective-C.<br></p><p>Charles<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160903/bcad1664/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/06c1dcc7dce6a93d194b9c013376e3f0?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0140: Bridge Optional As Its Payload Or NSNull</strong> from <string>Joe Groff</string> &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt;<p>September  6, 2016 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Sep 2, 2016, at 5:17 PM, Charles Srstka via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Sep 2, 2016, at 5:50 PM, Douglas Gregor via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review through constructive criticism and, eventually, determine the direction of Swift.

This proposal flies directly in the face of that, and threatens to make it much easier to create bugs caused by NSNull objects showing up where they are not expected. In this way, I feel that it is an almost 180° contradiction of the feel and direction of Swift.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	• If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The only Objective-C bridges I have used in other languages have been in AppleScript and JXA, neither of which I would expect Swift to use as a model.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	• How much effort did you put into your review?

I work on a framework, and I was actually able to track down a user-reported crash to the lack of this sort of bridging. An engineer overlooked that an `Optional` value passed into an `Any` parameter, would be forwarded to the Objective-C API as an opaque object. Since we had not tested that particular type, we were unable to detect this issue. Adding this sort of bridging behavior (explicitly in the implementation of our function) is how we were able to fix this issue since the Objective-C API did accept `NSNull`.<br></p><p>Others on the mailing list have brought up concerns that this sort of bridging will defer the detection of API misuse in the case of `NSArray`. I think that, while that is a fair concern, it ignores other cases where this sort of bridging will actually fix crashes that would otherwise occur. Further, I think these concerns forget that fact that `Any` is only used for dynamic APIs. If you&#39;d like a strongly typed `NSArray`, you would use Objective-C lightweight generics. I would actually argue that dynamically bridging `NSNull` to `nil` is most consistent with the current behavior of Swift.<br></p><p>For example, the following cast succeeds since `Int?` is [kinda sorta] a subtype of `Int`.<br>```<br>Optional&lt;Int&gt;.Some(3) as Any as! Int<br>```<br>Thus, in Swift you can treat an `Optional&lt;T&gt;` stored inside an `Any` as if it were simply a `T`. In Objective-C though, this is not the case since there&#39;s no equivalent to this sort of dynamic `as!` cast. As such, it would be reasonable to bridge `Optional&lt;T&gt;` to `T | NSNull` such that we can similarly treat `T?` as if it were an `T` in Objective-C. Given that `Any` is used in dynamic APIs that can be passed *any* type, I don&#39;t think it is worrisome that this will convert to `NSNull`. If the API is designed to only accept certain types, this should be annotated with generics.<br></p><p>* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>I think so. I definitely don&#39;t think this issue is as important as fixing numeric bridging, but this seems like a logical improvement to the current bridging behavior.<br></p><p>* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Definitely. In my understanding, Objective-C interop is a major feature of Swift. The Swift team has done a fantastic job improving this since the first release of Swift, and this seems like a logical, incremental step in the same direction.<br></p><p>* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>I&#39;m not familiar with other languages with such comprehensive bridging features as Swift. Objective-C is built atop C, and thus has multiple concepts of null (NSNull and NULL), but it has never made sense to bridge between these because Objective-C is a superset of C, not an unrelated language that interops with C (and in this case, these separate types were necessary, something that has been avoided in Swift).<br></p><p>* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>I&#39;ve spent a significant number of hours dealings with issues causes by the lack of bridging, both with `Int8` and friends and here. The lack of bridging of `NSNull` and `nil` is definitely less expected than the lack of numeric bridging, but still problematic for those building Swift wrappers for a dynamic API on top of an Objective-C APIs.<br></p><p>&gt; On Sep 2, 2016, at 3:50 PM, Douglas Gregor via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The review of SE-0140 &quot;Bridge Optional As Its Payload Or NSNull&quot; begins now and runs through September 8, 2016.
