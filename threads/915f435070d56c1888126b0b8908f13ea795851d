This post was written to be an introduction to be Protocol-Oriented programming with a comparison to Object-Oriented programming.<br></p><p>POP was introduced to the World less than a year ago.  Over the next few years, as Swift changes and matures; the Protocol-Oriented programming paradigm will mature with it.  Hopefully I can continue to write about these changes as well.<br></p><p>My book does cover POP and the technologies that make up POP more extensively than this post does however I plan on writing several more posts, as time allows with my day job, to expand not only on this post but also on the material in my book. <br></p><p>Jon<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-users mailing list<br>&gt; swift-users at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-users<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20160305/aae8d552/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
