The proposal has been deferred from Swift 3. We agree that it would be valuable to give library authors the ability to bridge their own types from Objective-C into Swift using the same mechanisms as Foundation. However, we lack the confidence and implementation experience to commit to `_ObjectiveCBridgeable` in its current form as public API. In its current form, as its name suggests, the protocol was designed to accommodate the specific needs of bridging Objective-C object types to Swift value types. In the future, we may want to bridge with other platforms, including C++ value types or other object systems such as COM, GObject, JVM, or CLR. It isn&#39;t clear at this point whether these would be served by a generalization of the existing mechanism, or by bespoke bridging protocols tailored to each case. This is a valuable area to explore, but we feel that it is too early at this point to accept our current design as public API.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/attachments/20160413/d5588ae2/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
