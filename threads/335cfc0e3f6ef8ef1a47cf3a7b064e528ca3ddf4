The default case will only be match if the keyword will be called with `default` avoiding the unintended behaviour of a catch all.<br></p><p>In doing so we will have the same behaviour of fallthrough but in a safe way because the optional where clause will be checked and not skipped as today, and if the case specified (the case not the where) can’t be found after the keyword declaration the compiler can be raise an error.<br>This error can be useful if for some reason the case declaration order inside the switch is modified and the code flow created by the new keyword is altered.<br></p><p>In addition to this two new safe behaviour we can have a third one for “free”. we can have two different cases falling inside a third one without entering inside each other as  with the fallthrough.<br></p><p>I hope that this evolution can be met with the same useful discussion that the old thread has sparked and that has made me rethink the implementation from the old “reswitch” that was brought up there.<br></p><p><br>p.s. for now the new keyword is nameless because I’m not a native english speaker and I can’t come up with some word that has the correct meaning and I’m obviously open to suggestions :)<br></p><p>- Jacopo<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151208/335cddf4/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
