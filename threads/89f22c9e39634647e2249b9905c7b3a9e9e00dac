As I mentioned earlier in the thread, IUOs are going to become less common on Apple platforms, but they are here to stay in Swift as a whole.<br></p><p>&gt; In order to do this, I suggest finding a concise name for it. Like @IUO, but possibly more readable<br></p><p>I do agree that we should look for a shorter, better name. I suggest `@autounwrap`, by analogy with `@autoclosure`. Both features insert invisible syntax at usage sites to make an expression of one type appear to be an expression of a different type.<br></p><p>(Actually, I think that `@autoclosure` is a great analogy for this feature in many respects.)<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
