I have been working on one for Arch<br>(https://github.com/RLovelett/swift-aur) that eventually I will<br>contribute back to the?AUR[1]. I point this out because there are few<br>patches that have had to be made to the source to get it compile.<br></p><p>Once I get it consistently compiling I&#39;ll see what hasn&#39;t been submitted<br>as either a bug or patch and submit accordingly.<br></p><p>As of right now the little things seem to be Python 2 vs 3 support and<br>hard coded paths to some headers. There are some larger issues that I&#39;m<br>still trying to figure out where the automated build scripts are not<br>linking pthreads and dl correctly. Like I said once I can consistently<br>reproduce it/fix it I&#39;ll submit upstream.<br></p><p>On Thu, Dec 3, 2015, at 10:35 PM, Steve Linberg wrote:<br>&gt; Has anyone built Swift for CentOS 7 yet, or RHEL?
