(I don’t know if the compiler does infinite-loop optimization, or if it can detect it through a “while true” or similar convention.)

I would also propose a “goto LABEL case EXPRESSION,” where the LABEL marks a “switch” statement that surrounds the goto statement and reevaluates the switch with the new value.
