But isn’t this a good reason to let both function co-exist?<br></p><p>I am very fond of the idea of getting rid of the somewhat ugly and<br>potentially misinterpretable to:/through: labels by using the semantics<br>already embedded in ranges (in fact, I proposed it originally).<br>However, I appreciate the reasons we might need the other forms and am<br>wary of creating a design with duplicated functionality that doesn&#39;t<br>appear to have coherence.  My conclusion is that we don&#39;t quite yet know<br>what the right design is.<br></p><p>&gt; For example: (0..&lt;10).striding(by: 3) and stride(from: 0, to: 10, by: 3) look<br>&gt; quite similar. However, in case we already have a range variable,<br>&gt; someRange.striding(by: 3) is obviously a lot more readable than stride(from:<br>&gt; someRange.startIndex, to: someRange.endIndex, by: 3). The reason I’m giving this<br>&gt; example is that the two functions can have quite different use cases, so I’m<br>&gt; unsure why one of them must be removed in favor of the other.<br></p><p>We don&#39;t normally add duplicated functionality as syntactic sugar unless<br>the use case for it is *extremely* common and compelling.  I&#39;m not sure<br>this rises to that level.  If stride(from:to:by:) is more general than<br>Range.striding(by:), I am hard pressed to justify adding the latter<br>form, as much as I love it.<br></p><p>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     * that stride(by:), or rather striding(by:), was too verbose<br>&gt;<br>&gt; striding(by:) doesn’t have the from, to, though parameter labels that the Swift<br>&gt; 3 stride functions have, so to me this new method seems less verbose than the<br>&gt; others. Maybe it depends on how you look at it. “to” and “through” basically<br>&gt; refer to the “.” and “&lt;“ tails of the “…” and “..&lt;“ operators respectively, so<br>&gt; that’s mainly why I think striding(by:) would be a cleaner and more intuitive<br>&gt; way to stride through a sequence.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     On 21 May 2016, at 00:07, Xiaodi Wu<br>&gt;     &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     We&#39;ve had this discussion on a few occasions.
