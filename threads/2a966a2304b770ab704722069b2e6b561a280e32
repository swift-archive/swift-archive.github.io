If there is any ambiguity, since the auto-generated function are effectively declared as a static inside of another type, you could always disambiguate with “Float.floor” if necessary.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Obviously this is just brainstorming/talking out loud. Maybe this is silly. Maybe it’s terrible. (Probably both.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; L8r<br>&gt; Sean<br>&gt; <br></p><p>This is kind of the reverse of how operators work, isn’t it? (Or used to work, I don’t know if they’ve changed since the last time I looked)<br></p><p>We’re definitely having lots of discussions about how the ‘swifty’ way to structure the stdlib would seem a bit alien to people from other languages. C developers wouldn’t discover `(4.4).floor()` or `(4.4).roundedDown()` because their primitive value types don’t have instance methods. At the same time, we seem to have resolved against global functions.<br></p><p>Is better documentation maybe the answer? Perhaps these could be examples in the Swift programming guide. When it comes to functions like `filter`, perhaps a glossary? The standard library is intentionally kept small, so it could be manageable to just keep a mapping of commonly-confused functions.<br></p><p>Ultimately, people are going to a) check code completion, and failing that b) google it. For things like ‘filter’, it’s a one-off friction of a handful of seconds. Maybe we should just be more ruthless; maybe we can afford to be these days.<br></p><p>Karl<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c74c15ba14b1096d4e42900ddd2dacd0?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Discussion] Terms of Art Swiftification</strong> from <string>Patrick Smith</string> &lt;pgwsmith at gmail.com&gt;<p>June 28, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>I liked Brent Royal-Gordon’s suggestion of `every(where:)`.

How can Swift come into its own if it isn’t allowed to have its own names for things that work with its own rules? I mean, sure, not *every* name needs to change and not every word needs to change, but it feels to me like we’re just coming up with our own dialect of a “standard” language that’s no different than American english vs. British english when what I think we should be exploring is more along the lines of the differences between english vs. greek.<br></p><p>l8r<br>Sean<br></p><p><br>&gt; On Jun 28, 2016, at 12:31 AM, Charlie Monroe via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Erica had a nice list of various term-of-art usages among languages - it included filter, map, etc. - I just can&#39;t seem to find it anywhere.

Flip the logic on it’s<br>&gt; head!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I fear that by adhering strongly to terms of art, we could be looking at a<br>&gt; floppy-save-icon scenario over time. What if there are simply better ways<br>&gt; of doing these things? What if the names themselves are blinding us to<br>&gt; other alternatives?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; One of the purposes of my thought of having aliases for functions/methods<br>&gt; is that it would give us an obvious primary location for a function -<br>&gt; inside of the correct type or protocol - that feels Swifty. It would allow<br>&gt; us to use “proper” Swift names that read fluently according to the<br>&gt; guidelines even if they are perhaps more verbose or nontraditional or even<br>&gt; unusual. Then by mapping those names to the existing common names, we can<br>&gt; bring people along without too much initial pain while still allowing<br>&gt; exploration of a new way to express things.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Swift already has a rather unusual rule in that statements are meant to<br>&gt; read like english phrases. It is meant to have a kind of human language<br>&gt; flow when read because code is read more than it is written. Virtually all<br>&gt; existing terms of art were NOT created with that kind of consideration. How<br>&gt; can Swift come into its own if it isn’t allowed to have its own names for<br>&gt; things that work with its own rules? I mean, sure, not *every* name needs<br>&gt; to change and not every word needs to change, but it feels to me like we’re<br>&gt; just coming up with our own dialect of a “standard” language that’s no<br>&gt; different than American english vs. British english when what I think we<br>&gt; should be exploring is more along the lines of the differences between<br>&gt; english vs. greek.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; l8r<br>&gt; Sean<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; On Jun 28, 2016, at 12:31 AM, Charlie Monroe via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Erica had a nice list of various term-of-art usages among languages - it<br>&gt; included filter, map, etc. - I just can&#39;t seem to find it anywhere. This<br>&gt; nicely showed that there is only a few languages that name things<br>&gt; differently, mostly C# and C++.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &quot;filter&quot; is nowadays quite a universal word that is in many languages -<br>&gt; and I&#39;m talking both about programming and a natural language. And I don&#39;t<br>&gt; think that it goes against what one might be expecting - when you open a<br>&gt; filter in the UI, you don&#39;t tick things that you don&#39;t want to see, but<br>&gt; items that you *do* want to see.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think that changing those names will add any additional value to<br>&gt; the Swift language.
