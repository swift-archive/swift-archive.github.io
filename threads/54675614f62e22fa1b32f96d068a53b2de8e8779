There was a proposal a while back to remove the bridging behavior from the “as” keyword, greatly simplifying its behavior, but discussion on it seems to have died down. I hope it can be revived once this proposal is accepted, since the need for “as NSError” was one of the main problems with that proposal.<br></p><p>&gt; One comment though:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Why is the errorDescription of LocalizedError an optional?

In my experience, this is usually in fact what you want, and NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey is a better fit for most purposes. For example, when throwing an error in an NSDocument subclass:<br></p><p>override func read(from data: Data, ofType typeName: String) throws {<br>    let userInfo = [NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey: &quot;Something went wrong.&quot;]<br>    throw NSError(domain: &quot;Foo&quot;, code: 1, userInfo: userInfo)<br>}<br></p><p>In the example above, the error is presented to the user as “The operation could not be completed.

The optional “errorDescription” property on CustomCocoaError/CustomNSError is there for bridging purposes, and localizedDescription is what you’d use to get the string for presentation. Having separate APIs for separate purposes is probably better than trying to hack two uses into the same property, honestly.<br></p><p>Charles<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160630/62a87c3f/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fab081724d16d497369e46fe76f20e12?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0112: Improved NSError Bridging</strong> from <string>Charles Srstka</string> &lt;cocoadev at charlessoft.com&gt;<p>June 30, 2016 at 09:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jun 30, 2016, at 9:19 PM, Charles Srstka &lt;cocoadev at charlessoft.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Actually, looking at the proposal again, it looks like Gregory has already solved this issue.<br></p><p>*Douglas<br></p><p>(Not sure how I swapped your first and last names in my mind.

I use NSError features heavily in Objective-C, and I&#39;ll be very, very glad to get powerful error bridging in Swift.<br></p><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s mentioned anywhere, but are the new protocols in Foundation or Stdlib? I&#39;m hoping they&#39;re in Foundation, because I consider localization to be a Foundation-level concern.<br></p><p>I have a number of critiques:<br></p><p>* I think we need the word &quot;localized&quot; on the properties of `LocalizedError`. The fact that they&#39;re localized is a very important semantic, and I don&#39;t think the fact that they come from a protocol called &quot;Localized&quot; is enough to signal that at use sites. (With &quot;localized&quot; added, `errorDescription` would no longer need the vacuous word &quot;error&quot; to avoid colliding with `CustomStringConvertible`.)<br></p><p>* I&#39;m not sure about including the `helpAnchor` property in `LocalizedError`. It&#39;s not even relevant on three of *Apple&#39;s* four platforms, let alone on others. Could it be separated?<br></p><p>* I would like to see more work on `RecoverableError`. I know this is a more or less faithful translation of `NSErrorRecoveryAttempting`, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a particularly good API, and I would like to see it revisited.<br></p><p>The design I&#39;d prefer would look more like this:<br></p><p>	protocol RecoverableError: Error {<br>		var recoveryOptions: [ErrorRecoveryOption] { get }<br>	}<br>	<br>	typealias ErrorRecoveryCompletionHandler = (recovered: Bool) -&gt; Void<br>	<br>	protocol ErrorRecoveryOption {<br>		var localizedName: String { get }<br>		func attemptRecovery(completion: ErrorRecoveryCompletionHandler) {…}<br>	}<br>	<br>	struct AnyErrorRecoveryOption: ErrorRecoveryOption {<br>		typealias RecoveryAttempter = (ErrorRecoveryCompletionHandler) -&gt; Void<br>		<br>		var localizedName: String<br>		var attempter: RecoveryAttempter<br>		<br>		init(localizedName: String, attempter: RecoveryAttempter) {…}<br>		<br>		func attemptRecovery(completion: CompletionHandler) { attempter(completion) }<br>	}<br></p><p>Though further from the equivalent Foundation API, I think this is a much cleaner design. It requires no `switch` statements, avoids issues with matching indices between the option array and the recovery attempter, and makes it easier for interested subtypes to add or remove recovery options.<br>		<br>In particular, in my view, there should be only one way to attempt recovery, and that way should not be application-modal. If a client wants to recover modally, we should invoke the non-modal API and then spin the runloop until the completion handler runs.<br></p><p>If a better `RecoverableError` design isn&#39;t feasible in Swift 3, I think we can defer it. In a pinch, `CustomNSError` provides the ability to specify error-handling behavior the old-fashioned way.<br></p><p>* You show an AVError struct with a nested .Code enum. Do you envision people doing similar things for pure-Swift error types? If so, what would that look like, and could it be made more ergonomic? If not, what do you imagine a similarly full-featured error type would look like?<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Absolutely! NSError provides a remarkably powerful infrastructure, especially on the Mac, and most developers ignore it to their detriment.

The most common user of this protocol is the person implementing conformance for it. “Localized” is right up there in the protocol name, which usually won’t be far from the declarations of these properties. Repeating it in all the property names seems redundant and unnecessarily verbose, and very much not in keeping with the general feel of Swift 3.<br></p><p>2. The word “error” would need to be kept in “errorDescription” anyway, since simply renaming it “localizedDescription” would cause it to conflict with the property that is being added to ErrorProtocol itself. It would probably need to be named “localizedErrorDescription” or some such, which is really getting too long.<br></p><p>3. I’ve always felt the “Localized” in all those constant names was unnecessary, even in the old Objective-C API. Isn’t it kind of a given that a user-facing string should be localized? Why would you ever want a non-localized error description, failure reason, etc. in the first place? Should we add “localized” to the beginnings of, for example, NSAlert’s ‘messageText&#39; and ‘informativeText&#39; properties? Those properties certainly should be localized. How about NSSavePanel’s ‘prompt’ property? IMO, it’s unnecessary verbiage.<br></p><p>Charles<br></p><p><br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160701/1698f62d/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c450c87df0788b8e1f7a6ca17ea34c7?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0112: Improved NSError Bridging</strong> from <string>Douglas Gregor</string> &lt;dgregor at apple.com&gt;<p>July  3, 2016 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jul 1, 2016, at 6:25 PM, Brent Royal-Gordon via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Massively in favor overall.

Could it be separated?<br></p><p>It’s defaulted; why bother to split it into a separate protocol?<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; * I would like to see more work on `RecoverableError`. I know this is a more or less faithful translation of `NSErrorRecoveryAttempting`, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a particularly good API, and I would like to see it revisited.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The design I&#39;d prefer would look more like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	protocol RecoverableError: Error {<br>&gt; 		var recoveryOptions: [ErrorRecoveryOption] { get }<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; 	<br>&gt; 	typealias ErrorRecoveryCompletionHandler = (recovered: Bool) -&gt; Void<br>&gt; 	<br>&gt; 	protocol ErrorRecoveryOption {<br>&gt; 		var localizedName: String { get }<br>&gt; 		func attemptRecovery(completion: ErrorRecoveryCompletionHandler) {…}<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; 	<br>&gt; 	struct AnyErrorRecoveryOption: ErrorRecoveryOption {<br>&gt; 		typealias RecoveryAttempter = (ErrorRecoveryCompletionHandler) -&gt; Void<br>&gt; 		<br>&gt; 		var localizedName: String<br>&gt; 		var attempter: RecoveryAttempter<br>&gt; 		<br>&gt; 		init(localizedName: String, attempter: RecoveryAttempter) {…}<br>&gt; 		<br>&gt; 		func attemptRecovery(completion: CompletionHandler) { attempter(completion) }<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Though further from the equivalent Foundation API, I think this is a much cleaner design. It requires no `switch` statements, avoids issues with matching indices between the option array and the recovery attempter, and makes it easier for interested subtypes to add or remove recovery options.<br></p><p>I agree that we could probably do better with the design, although this feels a bit heavy with the introduction of the ErrorRecoveryOption protocol. The common case is probably an enum where each case  describes an option, but I don’t have a natural way to model that.<br>		<br>&gt; In particular, in my view, there should be only one way to attempt recovery, and that way should not be application-modal. If a client wants to recover modally, we should invoke the non-modal API and then spin the runloop until the completion handler runs.<br></p><p>Hrm. I’d very much prefer to let the system frameworks handle this, but that’s partly because I don’t have a lot of experience to fall back on with recovering from errors in Cocoa.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; If a better `RecoverableError` design isn&#39;t feasible in Swift 3, I think we can defer it. In a pinch, `CustomNSError` provides the ability to specify error-handling behavior the old-fashioned way.<br></p><p>Sure, we could delay just this bit if we think some significantly better design is coming.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; * You show an AVError struct with a nested .Code enum. Do you envision people doing similar things for pure-Swift error types? If so, what would that look like, and could it be made more ergonomic? If not, what do you imagine a similarly full-featured error type would look like?<br></p><p>I wouldn’t expect to see this come up often, because error types are generally enums, and Swift enums can carry arbitrary data in their cases. Imported enums are different because we might need to be able to refer to the “raw” code type in other APIs.<br></p><p>	- Doug<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bdd257c9369fb68e1d06923d10ff789e?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0112: Improved NSError Bridging</strong> from <string>Ben Rimmington</string> &lt;me at benrimmington.com&gt;<p>July  5, 2016 at 06:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0112-nserror-bridging.md&gt;<br></p><p>If &lt;Foundation/NSError.h&gt; uses NS_EXTENSIBLE_STRING_ENUM for `domain` names and `userInfo` keys, would a generic type (cf.

Regardless, we shouldn’t contort a protocol design to discourage usage; we should make it clear what conforming to the protocol implies.<br></p><p>&gt; The protocol will be as easy-to-understand as the NSError class itself. If there are default implementations for all requirements, a conforming type can still opt into specific behavior.<br></p><p>“As easy-to-understand as the NSError class” is not the goal here. We want to do better, and that means detangling the various different things that NSError puts together.<br></p><p>With this proposal, you define an error type like this:<br></p><p>enum HomeworkError : ErrorProtocol {<br>  case forgotten<br>  case lost<br>  case dogAteIt<br>}<br></p><p>To give it a nice, localized error message (or other localized information), you conform to LocalizedError:<br></p><p>extension HomeworkError : LocalizedError {<br>  var errorDescription: String? {<br>    switch self {<br>    case .forgotten: return NSLocalizedString(&quot;I forgot it&quot;)<br>    case .lost: return NSLocalizedString(&quot;I lost it&quot;)<br>    case .dogAteIt: return NSLocalizedString(&quot;The dog ate it&quot;)<br>    }<br>  }<br>}<br></p><p>and if you want to implement recovery attempts for your error, you conform to RecoverableError:<br></p><p>extension HomeworkError : RecoverableError {<br>  // implementation here<br>}<br></p><p>You can catch these errors with “catch let error as HomeworkError”, or “catch HomeworkError.forgotten”, or whatever.<br></p><p>Nowhere in any of that did I mention NSError, or error domains, or codes, or user-info dictionaries. You shouldn’t need them with this model, at all. NSError is bridged away completely, and is an implementation detail of Objective-C interoperability. CustomNSError, and references to the NSError type, is an escape hatch so that one can get precise control over the interoperability with NSError for those (hopefully rare) cases where the Swift error-handling model can’t express something that NSError can.<br></p><p><br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Instead of using NSError.setUserInfoValueProvider(forDomain:provider:) <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; could you wrap the CustomNSError value inside an NSError subclass?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	class _CustomNSError: NSError {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	    private let _error: CustomNSError<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	    init(_error: CustomNSError) {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	        self._error = _error<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	        super.init(<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	            domain:   _error.dynamicType.errorDomain,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	            code:     _error.errorCode,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	            userInfo: _error.errorUserInfo)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	    }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	    override var localizedDescription: String {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	        return _error.errorDescription ?? super.localizedDescription<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	    }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	    override var localizedFailureReason: String? {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	        return _error.failureReason ?? super.localizedFailureReason<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	    }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	    override var localizedRecoverySuggestion: String? {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	        return _error.recoverySuggestion ?? super.localizedRecoverySuggestion<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	    }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	    override var localizedRecoveryOptions: [String]? {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	        return _error.recoveryOptions ?? super.localizedRecoveryOptions<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	    }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	    override var recoveryAttempter: AnyObject? {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	        if _error.recoveryOptions != nil {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	            return _NSErrorRecoveryAttempter(error: _error)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	        } else {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	            return super.recoveryAttempter<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	        }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	    }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	    override var helpAnchor: String? {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	        return _error.helpAnchor ?? super.helpAnchor<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	    }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	}<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; We could, but why? This is precisely what user-info value providers were designed for.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If the NSError.setUserInfoValueProvider(forDomain:provider:) method isn&#39;t available in all supported target platforms, an NSError subclass seems to be the simpler option.<br></p><p>When/where it is available, NSError.setUserInfoValueProvider(forDomain:provider:) is the solution recommended by Cocoa as the best way to lazily populate the userInfo dictionary, so it makes sense for us to use that mechanism. Sure, we need to implement a fallback, but the use of that fallback will go away at some point and we’ll be back to one implementation.<br></p><p>	- Doug<br></p><p><br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160705/ce2194ff/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
