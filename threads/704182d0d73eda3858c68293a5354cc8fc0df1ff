You manually change code will not cause Xcode using Swift 3.0 automatically.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Zhaoxin​<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, Sep 9, 2016 at 10:26 AM, Saagar Jha &lt;saagar at saagarjha.com &lt;mailto:saagar at saagarjha.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I am aware that there were new proposals, and I’ve been following along and manually migrating. The errors are due to Xcode using the Swift 2.3 compiler, which doesn’t like the new Swift 3 syntax (for example, it’s complaining that it can’t find the new types that have the NS- prefix dropped). I’m just looking for the flag in build settings that switches the compilers.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Saagar Jha<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Sep 8, 2016, at 16:47, Zhao Xin &lt;owenzx at gmail.com &lt;mailto:owenzx at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ​I think you can just use Xcode&#39;s tool that you upgrade to Swift 3.0. However, I suggest you do a backup of your project first in case this is not helpful.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, the errors you saw were probably not because of Xcode converted you code to 2.3 automatically. It wouldn&#39;t do that. The real reason is that in Xcode 6 beta6, a lot of Swift 3.0 accepted proposals were implemented and released, which made the Swift 3.0 far more different from the previous 3.0. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Xcode&#39;s migration tool is closed sourced and is not part of Swift. ​If you have further questions, I suggest you to ask it in Apple&#39;s developer forum.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Zhaoxin<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Fri, Sep 9, 2016 at 5:01 AM, Saagar Jha via swift-users &lt;swift-users at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-users at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I’ve migrated one of my projects to Swift 3 previously, with an earlier beta of Xcode.

Due to my experiences it looks like generating preview of changes runs build process that fails on code signing. The message in this case can be misleading (I consider it a bug) but try to set your provisioning profiles correctly for both build configurations (make sure certificates are valid) and give it another try (Edit &gt; Convert &gt; To Current Swift Syntax…).<br></p><p>Stano<br></p><p>&gt; On 08 Sep 2016, at 23:01, Saagar Jha via swift-users &lt;swift-users at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-users at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hi,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I’ve migrated one of my projects to Swift 3 previously, with an earlier beta of Xcode.
