Apologies for the short review cycle, but<br>&gt; we’re right up against the end of source breaking changes for Swift 3.<br>&gt; The proposal is available here:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0133-rename-flatten-to-joined.md<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Reviews are an important part of the Swift evolution process. All<br>&gt; reviews should be sent to the swift-evolution mailing list at<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 	https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; or, if you would like to keep your feedback private, directly to the review manager.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What goes into a review?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review<br>&gt; through constructive criticism and contribute to the direction of<br>&gt; Swift. When writing your review, here are some questions you might<br>&gt; want to answer in your review:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt; 	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar<br>&gt; feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br></p><p>I&#39;m giving the overall idea a +0 and the specific proposal as currently<br>written a -1, because I think this is a much more complicated bikeshed<br>than it appears to be on the surface and the proposal doesn&#39;t begin to<br>address the issues.  Specifically, I&#39;m concerned about these points:<br></p><p>* `flatten` works on Optional&lt;Optional&lt;T&gt;&gt; and sequences of Optional&lt;T&gt;.<br>  How does it make sense to rename these operations “join?”<br></p><p>* The name and semantics of `flatten` is linked to that of `flatMap`.<br>  It&#39;s almost impossible to explain what `flatMap` does without<br>  reference to `flatten`.  Will it make sense to explain `flatMap` in<br>  terms of `joined`?<br></p><p>* `flatten` is a functional term of art in the same family as `flatMap`.<br>  We have good reasons to consider changing some of the other names in<br>  this family, such as `filter` and `reduce`, but that idea has met with<br>  significant resistance on the list.  How far should we go?  Does it<br>  make sense to make this one change alone?<br></p><p>I could be convinced to change my evaluation of the proposal if there<br>are good answers to these questions, but until then, I&#39;m not won over.<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e9f543f0ffdb7c9a899e628fe76e7f3?s=50"></div><header><strong>[SHORT Review] SE-0133: Rename `flatten()` to `joined()`</strong> from <string>Jacob Bandes-Storch</string> &lt;jtbandes at gmail.com&gt;<p>July 25, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Mon, Jul 25, 2016 at 1:11 PM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;<br>&gt; I&#39;m giving the overall idea a +0 and the specific proposal as currently<br>&gt; written a -1, because I think this is a much more complicated bikeshed<br>&gt; than it appears to be on the surface and the proposal doesn&#39;t begin to<br>&gt; address the issues.
