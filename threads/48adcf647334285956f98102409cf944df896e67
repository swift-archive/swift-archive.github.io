Why?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Because in Swift, private means “use only inside this file” and not<br>&gt; “use only inside this class / scope”. In C++ private means “use only<br>&gt; inside this class”. Moreover, C++ puts a special emphasis on this —<br>&gt; variables are private inside the class unless the code specifically<br>&gt; says otherwise.<br></p><p>I ended up generally being explicit about scoping in C++ anyway: The<br>most-accessible (public) part of a C++ class declaration should appear<br>at the top, so you end up with everything thereafter being public unless<br>you go out of your way to explicitly specify access.<br></p><p>&gt;&gt;  Defining one type per file is usually a good practice anyway.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This really depends on the context.

I just think that it’s misnamed. The honest way to call it would be something like “file internal”. But even if the right name is already taken, we can still have the access level itself. I proposed “local” or “scoped”. (I’d prefer to rename private to file internal and call local “private”, but that raises backward compatibility issues, and I didn’t want the proposal to be rejected just for that reason.)<br></p><p>&gt; For what it&#39;s worth, my background, up until a few years ago, is as a<br>&gt; C++ programmer.

It’s to make it easy to use correctly. I always used const in C++ wherever possible, but it was a pain. Swift implementation is perfect. Very easy to use and encourages good practice. I don’t see why the same couldn’t be done with access control. (I think that making “local” the default access level would be a perfect solution, but simply having the option would be good enough for me. I’d use it everywhere to hide internal state and implementation details.)<br></p><p>&gt; On Jan 23, 2016, at 10:01 PM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; on Sat Jan 23 2016, Ilya Belenkiy &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, but with an API based access control, <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know what that term means, sorry.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I had to come up with this term to distinguish it from a file based<br>&gt;&gt; access control.

So far, the presented arguments were mostly ideological. As far as I understand it, Ilya’s point is based around a very rigorous notion of encapsulation (which I personally disagree with, but it doesn’t matter) and the necessity to enforce the design invariants. The definition scope access here aids as a safeguard that separates the public and the private interface. This is obviously an important feature and the reasoning is principally valid. On the other side, the opponents argue that such separation is barely useful on practice, because a single file in a well designed code is usually restricted to a few closely related declarations, so the chance to mix up the private and the public interface is actually pretty slim.  And the private interface is invisible outside the file level, so the large scale aspect of this issue never becomes valid. There is undoubtedly some truth in this as well. Personally, I would be ok with either, but I am more tending towards the view that definition scope access is unnecessary. Let me present some arguments:<br></p><p>1. It only solves a small subset of a larger problem. If we really give were to stress the importance of enforced design invariants that much, then definition scope access is actually not enough. What we really need is a permission system, where we describe the exact usage of a member, e.g. this method can be only called from that one or this method can’t be called if the state is like this etc. In the end, unless we have built-in means to prove our code, invariants need to be tested with tests and assertions — and these should catch any misuse of private APIs.<br></p><p>2. The problem it solves is arguably barely worth mentioning. How often do you have to add principally new types to a file with other declarations? How often is it easy to confuse private and public interfaces? It is really such a common thing to accidentally misuse an API and do not notice it? Usually, I would not bring any substantial functionality into a source file written by others without first gaining basic understanding about the other contents of that file. And also, usually, if I am about to bring any substantial functionality into a source file written by others, I do it because I understand what is going on there and I just want to improve/enhance something. For instance (to bring some anecdotic evidence into play), I am mainly working with a language that lacks any access declarations whatsoever (R), and I never really had an issue with this. And I am often employing techniques which involve metaprogramming and on-the-fly replacement of definition scopes, so its fairly complex stuff.  It is usually very clear which functionality is meant to be private and which is meant to be public, and to be honest, I quite frequently find myself accusing the private one for a number of reasons (usually efficiency and performance). <br></p><p>3. It assumes that the designer gets the design correct on the first try. How do you know whether you should declare a property local or private? Maybe you start as local (default) but at some point realise that it would be useful to open it up to other scopes for efficiency/other reasons? Especially in the initial design phase, there is a lot of moving around. Redeclaring invariants is not without effort, even though this is a very minor criticism point. Just wanted to mention it for the sake of completeness (of what came into my mind).<br></p><p>4. It hinders competent extenders. Imagine you understand the code really well. You want to add a new auxiliary public function, and it would be much more efficient if you accessed the private interface directly. However, the original designer did not anticipate your use case, so they declared that interface local. So you’d need to go and change the modifiers to private, which is kind of unnecessary effort. <br></p><p>To sum it up, I believe that restricting access like that gives you a sense of false security. It is not really likely to prevent bugs from happening, but it does limit the extendability of the code. The issues it aims to solved can be easily solved by minimal degree of coding discipline (such as: do not go changing around stuff in a file unless you understand what you are doing) and I doubt that experienced programmers are likely to encounter these issues very frequently (I know I never did, and I wouldn’t even call myself that experienced). Code testing should be performed by debug assertions and unit tests, which will easily detect any relevant case of API misuse. In the end, I believe that definition scope restricts mostly for ideological, but not practical reasons, given the coding style most appropriate with Swift. <br></p><p>Can we add a definition scope access to Swift? Sure, it won’t change much. Will we benefit from this change? I doubt so. The current system is good enough and its quite elegant in allowing one to implement tightly related functionality. <br></p><p>Finally some comments on Matthew’s post<br></p><p>&gt; In some cases, this is because there is a nested type involved and the `private` members are inside the nested type.  They should not be visible outside the scope of the nested type.  <br></p><p><br>But sometimes, if one wants to extend functionality or improve efficiency, and know what they are doing, having access to these private members could be beneficial. If they should not be visible outside of the scope in the first place, the person who implements the container type probably knows it and is unlikely to access them directly<br></p><p>&gt; One other case that didn’t appear in Alamofire, but I have seen elsewhere is a case where you conform several types to the same protocol (usually a simple protocol) in the same file.  In this case there may be helper methods that support the protocol implementation but should not be visible to the other implementations of the protocol that are in the same file.<br></p><p><br>How likely is one to call one of those helper methods in actual code? I don’t see any potential for confusion at all. Unless you are working on a type that extents the type with the private method, but it doesn’t seem to be your example<br></p><p>&gt; It seems like “current scope” is probably the most frequent intent of `private`<br></p><p>That is undoubtedly true. However, the question should be put the other way: how frequently does the file scope obscure, obfuscate or otherwise denies this frequent use?<br></p><p>&gt; I suggest those who are pushing back on this look through some real-world code.  How often do you actually need the file-level visibility of a `private` member?  This is likely only needed in a significant minority of uses of `private`. <br></p><p><br>Personally, I use it quite often because of the way I like to design things as groups of tightly interdependent components (friends, if you want) who are aware of each other’s inner workings. I also want to have full access to the interface of any project I work on because I trust myself to make the judgement whether I am allowed to use a particular functionality or not.

Rather than `internal` we could have `module` and `file` access modifiers to make it clear when there is broader visibility and make it clear exactly what that visibility is.  This would be my preference and I think it would provide the most clarity.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; On the other hand, changing the meaning of `private` is probably not going to happen at this point (or would at least likely receive even more pushback than `local`), thus the proposal to add a new modifier and not change the meaning of existing modifiers.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I suggest those who are pushing back on this look through some real-world code.  How often do you actually need the file-level visibility of a `private` member?  This is likely only needed in a significant minority of uses of `private`. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Saying what you mean and meaning what you say adds clarity to the code.  It helps readers and future maintainers of the code understand the thinking of the author.  Right now, we do not have the ability to say what we actually mean with regards to access control in a significant number of cases.

That’s my design decision.<br>&gt;&gt; For the same reason the compiler does not enforce where I have to put „private“ (it can make suggestions like many IDEs do and offer fix-its, like „this method can be made private as it is not used outside the class“ or „this class can be put into its own file as its private methods are not used by other components in this file“.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Since this rule is not enforced, at most, this is coding by convention. By the same reasoning, we could have just one type, object, and name every variable by including the type name we want it to be. No need for a strong type system. And anyone insisting that we need a type system would surely be wrong because there would be a very simple solution — just make the type name part of the variable name.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; No, there is a clear difference: making the type name part of the variable name enforces no compiler checks whereas putting something into different files does. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; And yet, Swift does have a strong type system.

With „local“ it is possible to break the class invariant without modifying the source code of a private method just by adding some public methods that call the private ones.

As you noted, it is simple to increase visibility if you already have access to the file, allowing you to extend the code as you wish.<br></p><p>&gt; The issues it aims to solved can be easily solved by minimal degree of coding discipline (such as: do not go changing around stuff in a file unless you understand what you are doing) and I doubt that experienced programmers are likely to encounter these issues very frequently (I know I never did, and I wouldn’t even call myself that experienced). Code testing should be performed by debug assertions and unit tests, which will easily detect any relevant case of API misuse. In the end, I believe that definition scope restricts mostly for ideological, but not practical reasons, given the coding style most appropriate with Swift. <br>&gt; <br></p><p>I know Ilya has been emphasizing the argument around protecting invariants.  IMO the stronger argument is that the distinction between scope visibility and file visibility aids understanding of the intent and current usage of a member.  Those who take advantage of the narrower, scope-based access modifier will find it is more common than file based visibility.  They will be able to make more assumptions with certainty when reading code in their projects.  <br></p><p>I agree that this is not a game-changer, but the benefit is also not trivial at all.  It is easily significant enough to warrant a relatively simple feature addition IMO.<br></p><p>&gt; Can we add a definition scope access to Swift? Sure, it won’t change much. Will we benefit from this change? I doubt so. The current system is good enough and its quite elegant in allowing one to implement tightly related functionality. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Finally some comments on Matthew’s post<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; In some cases, this is because there is a nested type involved and the `private` members are inside the nested type.  They should not be visible outside the scope of the nested type.  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; But sometimes, if one wants to extend functionality or improve efficiency, and know what they are doing, having access to these private members could be beneficial. If they should not be visible outside of the scope in the first place, the person who implements the container type probably knows it and is unlikely to access them directly<br></p><p>I don’t disagree.  But this doesn’t allow the implementer to communicate their intent to readers of the code (unless they use comments).<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; One other case that didn’t appear in Alamofire, but I have seen elsewhere is a case where you conform several types to the same protocol (usually a simple protocol) in the same file.  In this case there may be helper methods that support the protocol implementation but should not be visible to the other implementations of the protocol that are in the same file.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; How likely is one to call one of those helper methods in actual code? I don’t see any potential for confusion at all. Unless you are working on a type that extents the type with the private method, but it doesn’t seem to be your example<br></p><p>It isn’t likely, but the point is that a scope-based access modifier would make the intent 100% clear, without question.  There is no reason we should accept any doubt about intent when making the intent clear is a simple language enhancement that is actually the right thing in most cases (scope level visibility rather than file level visibility).<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; It seems like “current scope” is probably the most frequent intent of `private`<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That is undoubtedly true. However, the question should be put the other way: how frequently does the file scope obscure, obfuscate or otherwise denies this frequent use?<br></p><p>Any time there is more than one scope there is at least some potential for this.  As mentioned, I could not be sure in several cases when reading Alamofire without searching the file.  I think the language should make it possible to specify intent clearly in the most common use case.  It simply does not do that today.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I suggest those who are pushing back on this look through some real-world code.  How often do you actually need the file-level visibility of a `private` member?  This is likely only needed in a significant minority of uses of `private`. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Personally, I use it quite often because of the way I like to design things as groups of tightly interdependent components (friends, if you want) who are aware of each other’s inner workings.<br>&gt; I also want to have full access to the interface of any project I work on because I trust myself to make the judgement whether I am allowed to use a particular functionality or not.

This would be my preference and I think it would provide the most clarity.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On the other hand, changing the meaning of `private` is probably not going to happen at this point (or would at least likely receive even more pushback than `local`), thus the proposal to add a new modifier and not change the meaning of existing modifiers.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I suggest those who are pushing back on this look through some real-world code.

Exactly the same reasoning applies to “local”. If it’s just a convention that is not enforced by the compiler, we lose a very useful way to verify code correctness. In addition to that, everything that is marked as “local” (or “_” in front of the name)  now shows up in code completions and adds noise and temptation to cut corners (often this would be “faster” functions that already assume certain things about the state that may generally not be true). There are plenty of discussions about Cocoa private APIs on the web where the only thing that is stopping people is whether using them will pass the app store check (and if there is a secret back door still).

The reasoning is the same as having real types instead of conventions for naming objects:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Imagine that the Swift compiler did nothing for types — it was just a useful way to convey the coder’s intent. Maintaining the code in this context would become much more difficult:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) the compiler would not help catch mistakes.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) the tools would not provide contextual auto completions or useful type related information in general<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I am sure that everyone would be less comfortable shipping a large codebase that didn’t go through all the type checks. Exactly the same reasoning applies to “local”. If it’s just a convention that is not enforced by the compiler, we lose a very useful way to verify code correctness. In addition to that, everything that is marked as “local” (or “_” in front of the name)  now shows up in code completions and adds noise and temptation to cut corners (often this would be “faster” functions that already assume certain things about the state that may generally not be true).

And when editing the narrow scope (the file), one should make sure that one knows that they are doing (not unlike what you wrote yourself). <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not arguing that Swift needs, say, Scala&#39;s level of detail in its access modifiers, but I think an access modifier for private-to-class or private-to-instance or private-to-scope would let past-Rob convey useful information to future-Rob in a lot of places where currently the information is less precise or entirely absent, and that this ability is useful enough to justify the additional language complexity.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, I quite agree with you here. But I still don’t think that declaration scope access is really necessary to achieve this (because quite honestly, the future-Taras messages are best conveyed through documentation strings :) ). See also the summary at the end of my mail. Subclass scope is a different story, because it has many practical uses, but thats a topic for another discussion. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On 26 Jan 2016, at 14:00, Ilya Belenkiy via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The reasoning is the same as having real types instead of conventions for naming objects:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I do not believe that your example is even remotely appropriate.

I also want to have full access to the interface of any project I work on because I trust myself to make the judgement whether I am allowed to use a particular functionality or not.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; By this logic, you don&#39;t want or need private (Swift&#39;s private-to-file) either. You just want/need internal and public, because you trust your judgement and you want access to everything in the project.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I trust my judgement, but I don&#39;t trust my memory. In six months, I won&#39;t remember every detail of the code I wrote today. Private-to-file is a message from past-me to future-me: &quot;Dear future-Rob, you don&#39;t need to worry about looking for any use of this element outside this file, but if you want to make it visible to other files, you better study it to make sure it&#39;s safe to expose. Warmest regards, past-Rob.&quot;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This is a useful message. It helps jog future-Rob&#39;s memory, it saves future-Rob from bugs, and it lets past-Rob rest easy because the message is guaranteed to be delivered, and is guaranteed to be correct.
