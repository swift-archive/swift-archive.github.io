I don’t have time to look through<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the full patch but did look through quite a bit.  It adds clarity in<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the vast majority of cases I looked at.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems like with-as-separator is a good heuristic for determining<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when the first parameter is not essential to a good name for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fundamental operation.  I agree with the comments earlier on that in<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these cases a label for the first parameter is the best approach.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I also really like that this groups methods with the same fundamental<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; operation into overload families where they previously had independent<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; names.  This is a big win IMO.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a first-parameter-is-an-ID pattern I noticed after this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; change.  I show a few examples here, but there are a lot more:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -  func trackWithTrackID(trackID: CMPersistentTrackID) -&gt; AVAssetTrack?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; +  func track(trackID trackID: CMPersistentTrackID) -&gt; AVAssetTrack?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -  func trackWithTrackID(trackID: CMPersistentTrackID) -&gt; AVFragmentedAssetTrack?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; +  func track(trackID trackID: CMPersistentTrackID) -&gt; AVFragmentedAssetTrack?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -  func trackWithTrackID(trackID: CMPersistentTrackID) -&gt; AVCompositionTrack?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; +  func track(trackID trackID: CMPersistentTrackID) -&gt; AVCompositionTrack?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - func discoverUserInfoWithUserRecordID(userRecordID: CKRecordID,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; completionHandler: (CKDiscoveredUserInfo?, Error?) -&gt; Void)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; + func discoverUserInfo(userRecordID userRecordID: CKRecordID,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; completionHandler: (CKDiscoveredUserInfo?, Error?) -&gt; Void)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The first argument label `trackID` seems like it repeats type<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; information without adding clarity.  I think it would be better to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just use `id` here.  It seems like a candidate for heuristics as well.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For example, if the type name ends in ID and the label is a suffix of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the type name we could just use `id`.  This is a somewhat specific<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pattern, but IDs are common enough that it might make sense.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually I&#39;ve been saying for a while that arguments called ID,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; identifier, and name should not be labelled at all in many cases.  Think<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Patch where the words “ID”, “Identifier”, and “Name” in a name are considered to match the type “String”:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;id-identifier-name-match-string.patch&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; … and then extending the rule to zap first argument labels named “identifier”, “id”, or “name”:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;id-identifier-name-no-first-arg-label.patch&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (I’m not sure which one of these you meant, or something different):<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	- Doug<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4fe988326eed161b989d0c5521cb105?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0005 Better Translation of Objective-C APIs Into Swift</strong> from <string>Jordan Rose</string> &lt;jordan_rose at apple.com&gt;<p>January 29, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jan 28, 2016, at 14:15, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I&#39;m very used to &quot;fooWithBar: baz&quot; meaning either &quot;get me the foo that<br>&gt;&gt; has a bar matching baz&quot; or &quot;create me a foo with its bar set to<br>&gt;&gt; baz&quot;. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; That&#39;s great, when that&#39;s what &quot;with&quot; means.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; But I&#39;m not sure this new convention is any worse, now that the base<br>&gt;&gt; name isn&#39;t assumed to include the first argument.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The problem is that, I&#39;m guessing at least 50% of the time, &quot;with&quot; is<br>&gt; just used as a vacuous connector to make the method name sound<br>&gt; grammatical, and &quot;fooWithBar&quot; doesn&#39;t actually mean the &quot;foo&quot; has-a<br>&gt; &quot;bar.&quot;  In these cases, it&#39;s actively misleading.

It only generates confusion if the method name as spoken is different than the method name as written.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jan 30, 2016, at 7:45 AM, Radosław Pietruszewski via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s important to be able to talk about these methods in a natural way, and a natural way to say this sentence in English is to put that connecting word there.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is this so important?

I can see more changes in the diff that seem worse than changes that seem like an improvement….<br></p><p>Best,<br>— Radek<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160202/64ac3f34/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c450c87df0788b8e1f7a6ca17ea34c7?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0005 Better Translation of Objective-C APIs Into Swift</strong> from <string>Douglas Gregor</string> &lt;dgregor at apple.com&gt;<p>February  2, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Feb 1, 2016, at 3:45 PM, Radosław Pietruszewski &lt;radexpl at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Exceptions:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - &quot;fooWithOptions&quot;, but that&#39;s already caught by the default parameter rule.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - &quot;fooWithLocale&quot;, which uses the locale to build the result.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - &quot;commonPrefixWithString&quot;, where the &quot;with&quot; isn&#39;t quite vacuous.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But when &quot;foo&quot; is a verb (or when it&#39;s a later parameter that&#39;s just &quot;withBar&quot;) it does seem pretty vacuous.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a great observation. Pull request here shows what this does:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-3-api-guidelines-review/pull/9 &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-3-api-guidelines-review/pull/9&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and, from the cases we’ve looked at, does a fantastic job of distinguishing the cases where “with” is a separator vs. “with” meaning some kind of selection criteria.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh no! Now I&#39;m sad I added a new automated rule based on parts of speech. As I&#39;ve said before, these rules are necessarily incomplete, difficult for non-native speakers, and problematic when a word can be either a noun or a verb (cf. &quot;displayNameWithLocale(_: NSLocale) -&gt; String&quot; and &quot;highlightWithLevel(_: CGFloat) -&gt; NSColor?”).<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; And they are (still) most of the basis for the automatic translation described in SE-0005. Frankly, I don’t think we can avoid using parts-of-speech analysis to transform Objective-C APIs into Swift APIs.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m looking at the diff but it&#39;s hard to tell what didn&#39;t change. Are there branches that differentiate the two different &quot;with&quot; heuristics?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The swift-3-first-argument-labels branch is the initial “with” heuristic Radek proposed. You can see the diffs between that heuristic and the “verb” heuristic here:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-3-api-guidelines-review/compare/swift-3-first-argument-labels...swift-3-first-argument-labels-verb &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-3-api-guidelines-review/compare/swift-3-first-argument-labels...swift-3-first-argument-labels-verb&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Ah, interesting!<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I definitely see the rationale for this. Calling a method like `tracks` seems a bit confusing, it doesn’t capture the intent at all. The ObjC-convention version, say, `tracksWithMediaType(…)`, though less clear, makes a better job at this.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I can see more methods of this kind in the diff, and they seem to benefit the most.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I mentioned this before, but the way I would prefer this named is `findTracks(…)`, and skip the “with” in the name. The intent is captured better than the original, we start with a verb, and the method name is separated from its parameters. But obviously this is unlikely to work as an automated translation.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Having said that, a lot of the changes seem like a step back:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;    func highlight(level val: CGFloat) -&gt; NSColor?		   func highlight(level val: CGFloat) -&gt; NSColor?<br>&gt;&gt; -  func shadow(level val: CGFloat) -&gt; NSColor?		+  func shadowWithLevel(val: CGFloat) -&gt; NSColor?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Inconsistency.
