Strings use opaque indices which specifically prevent you from doing this, so you have never been able to subscript a string with integers or ranges of integers. It&#39;s done this way because indexing into a Unicode string intrinsically requires walking through the data structure and counting characters one at a time; the lack of integer indices is meant to force you to explicitly write `index(after:)` or `index(_:offsetBy:)` (formerly `successor()` or `advancedBy(_:)`) in your code to make this cost obvious.<br></p><p>&gt; What documentation is this referring to?
