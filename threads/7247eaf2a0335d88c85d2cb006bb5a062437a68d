It’s even less likely when considering that convention seems to be for enum cases to start with a capital letter, while properties begin with lowercase letters, though there may be an argument that the test for ambiguity should be case insensitive (to protect against typos). However, it’s also possible that when a property and enum case name conflicts that only one will be a valid argument for the subscript/function anyway, so that’s another way that ambiguity can be avoided too.<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>Dot notation as shorthand in subscripts and functions</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>January 16, 2016 at 02:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; When used in a switch statement the dot notation is a kind of shorthand reference to the type of an enum, but it also seems like for non enums it could be a shorthand reference to self, allowing us to avoid having to write out variable references in a few common cases.<br></p><p>I think you don&#39;t realize how broad the existing leading-dot feature is.<br></p><p>Leading dot can be used in any place where a type can be inferred to access a static member of that type.
