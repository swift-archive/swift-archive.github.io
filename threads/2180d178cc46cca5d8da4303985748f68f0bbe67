Doug, did you have any comments here?<br></p><p><br>&gt; 2) Even if it did, I would still have the wrap #selector with NSStringFromSelector. It would be really convenient if Selector objects would convert to String. How is that possible?<br></p><p>I&#39;m not sure why this would make sense. Selectors are not strings. (However, they are CustomStringConvertible, so you can just use &quot;String(…)&quot; to convert them.)<br></p><p>Jordan<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>Argument of &#39;#selector&#39; cannot refer to a property?</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>February 22, 2016 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; 1) The compiler doesn’t accept #selector of properties with the error message: Argument of &#39;#selector&#39; cannot refer to a property. What’s the reasoning for that?<br></p><p>Because in Objective-C, a property is syntactic sugar for a pair of accessor methods, but in Swift, a property is a completely distinct entity from a method. <br></p><p>&gt; 2) Even if it did, I would still have the wrap #selector with NSStringFromSelector. It would be really convenient if Selector objects would convert to String. How is that possible?<br></p><p>It isn&#39;t appropriate. A selector is a different type from a string. Even Objective-C doesn&#39;t let you do this.<br></p><p>Basically, both of these are instances of you wanting vastly looser semantics. That&#39;s just not in Swift&#39;s nature.<br></p><p>A different way to approach this whole problem is to use strings instead of selectors for your field names, which allows you to use traditional Key-Value Coding:<br></p><p>	class Model: NSObject {<br>		dynamic var firstName: String = &quot;&quot;<br>		dynamic var lastName: String = &quot;&quot;<br>	}<br>	<br>	extension Model {<br>		static var jsonFields = [&quot;firstName&quot;, &quot;lastName&quot;]<br>		<br>		var jsonValue: [String: AnyObject] {<br>			return dictionaryWithValuesForKeys(Model.jsonFields)<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>You could even protocolize it for reusability:<br></p><p>	protocol JSONRepresentable {<br>		static var jsonFields: [String] { get }<br>		var jsonValue: [String: AnyObject] { get }<br>	}<br>	<br>	extension JSONRepresentable where Self: NSObject {<br>		var jsonValue: [String: AnyObject] {<br>			return dictionaryWithValuesForKeys(Self.jsonFields)<br>		}<br>	}<br>	<br>	class Model: NSObject {<br>		dynamic var firstName: String = &quot;&quot;<br>		dynamic var lastName: String = &quot;&quot;<br>	}<br>	<br>	extension Model: JSONRepresentable {<br>		static var jsonFields = [&quot;firstName&quot;, &quot;lastName&quot;]<br>	}<br></p><p>That solves both problems, though you lose the typo checking that #selector might provide.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
