When we develop Linux applications and utilities with Swift we need to use the system libraries provided by the Linux environment.  In this post will look at how we can use these system libraries with our Swift code to build useful applications and utilities.  <br></p><p>In this post we will look at the Glibc module that Apple provides for us which includes the majority of the Linux Standard Library.  We will also look at how we could create our own modules to add additional system libraries not included in the Glibc module.
