The proposal is *accepted* for Swift 3.  <br></p><p>The feedback on the community on the proposal was very light, but there were significant concerns about its name.  After discussion, the core team agrees that “x.dynamicType&quot; should use the syntax of a global function as stated by the proposal, but would prefer for that function to be spelled &quot;type(of: x)” to follow the naming guidelines.  The rationale is:<br></p><p>- The function is side-effect free, so it should have a noun that describes what is returned.<br>- “type” is ambiguously a noun, verb, and perhaps other things, so the “of” preposition is necessary for clarity.<br></p><p>The core team recognizes that this means that we should probably resyntax the existing sizeof/strideof functions, but that should be a follow-on discussion.<br></p><p>Many thanks to Erica Sadun for driving this discussion and writing a great proposal!<br></p><p>-Chris Lattner<br>Review Manager<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
