You might later go back and learn Objective-C if you find a need for it, but I&#39;d start with Swift. I don&#39;t know what you mean bye &quot;low level programming&quot; but that might mean you eventually want to improve your C programming skills. I can&#39;t speak too much to Windows, but C# is probably the language to learn for it.<br></p><p>I currently teach Python in introductory undergraduate course (and later the students learn C++ and there are electives in Java and Swift/iOS programming), but if a decent Swift IDE for Windows (code completion, breakpoints, and ideally playgrounds), I&#39;d be planning to switch to Swift for the intro course. About half my students have Macs and about half have Windows PCs so Swift is a good option without a good environment for it on Windows.<br></p><p>Dave<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/edbd5f1c2f535b14165ae883fa7c3f37?s=50"></div><header><strong>Learn Objective-C First? and Low Level Understanding of computer</strong> from <string>Jens Alfke</string> &lt;jens at mooseyard.com&gt;<p>July 30, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jul 30, 2016, at 10:36 AM, smd via swift-users &lt;swift-users at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I’m interested in learning Swift.

But that’s fairly easy — a lot of it is just knowing how to translate some syntax. For example, Objective-C “[x doSomething: y]” generally becomes “x.doSomething(y)” in Swift.<br></p><p>&gt; I’ve done some C, C++, VB 6.0, and VBA / Access in the past but I’m definitely not a programmer.<br></p><p>I’d recommend starting by learning fundamentals, instead of jumping into building an app. Fortunately Xcode’s Playgrounds are a good way to do that, since you can build things like data structures or algorithms interactively. There are a lot of interesting and challenging things you can build that don’t require a fancy GUI but will teach you a lot. For example, look up search trees and see if you can implement various types like binary trees, red/black trees or b-trees. Or implement your own Dictionary class with a hash table.<br></p><p>—Jens<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20160730/aff44d74/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
