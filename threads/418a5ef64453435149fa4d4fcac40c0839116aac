A few of us have been<br>&gt;     working on this issue here:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     https://github.com/lorenzoracca/Swift-binary-search<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     However we have sort of stalled as we have been unable to come up with a<br>&gt;     unary approach that Dave suggested using just Bool return values. And of<br>&gt;     course, as you say, the three case order enum would make this a trivial<br>&gt;     problem.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     I guess the question is, do we move forward without a unary implementation<br>&gt;     and update if/when we get a three case Order enum or do we wait on a three<br>&gt;     case Order enum and implement a fully generic version once?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     Jeff<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     On Thu, Apr 28, 2016 at 7:36 AM, Pyry Jahkola<br>&gt;     &lt;pyry.jahkola at iki.fi&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         Bringing up this topic because it became relevant with Brent<br>&gt;         Royal-Gordon&#39;s &quot;[Idea] Bringing the partial/total ordering distinction<br>&gt;         into Comparable&quot;.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         If the `&lt;=&gt;` operator with a return type of a three-case `enum Order`,<br>&gt;         you can fully define the most generic versions of binary searches as:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         lowerBound(compare: Self.Collection.Element -&gt; Order) -&gt; Index<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         etc.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             On 29 Mar 2016, at 13:43, Jeff Hajewski via swift-evolution<br>&gt;             &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             I&#39;ve responded below, but just for the sake of being explicit, this<br>&gt;             is roughly <br>&gt;             the signature for lowerBound, upperBound, and binarySearch I have in <br>&gt;             mind based on your comments of a unary predicate:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             lowerBound(isOrderedBelow: Self.Collection.Element -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Index<br>&gt;             upperBound(isOrderedBelow: Self.Collection.Element -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Index<br>&gt;             binarySearch(isOrderedBelow: Self.Collection.Element -&gt; Bool) -&gt;<br>&gt;             Bool<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             That&#39;s the general structure - the key is that the exact same<br>&gt;             predicate is<br>&gt;             used in all signatures. The predicate would be defined along the<br>&gt;             lines of<br>&gt;             a binary predicate where one of the parameters is fixed as the<br>&gt;             search value.<br>&gt;             The unary predicate could be formed along the lines of:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             let binaryPred = { $0 &lt; $1 }<br>&gt;             let unnaryPred = binaryPred($0, value)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             where value is the search value. The main point of illustrating that<br>&gt;             is that<br>&gt;             once the unary predicate is defined, we can&#39;t change the position of<br>&gt;             the<br>&gt;             search value within the predicate like they do in the C++<br>&gt;             implementation.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         You&#39;re right, there&#39;s no way a Bool-returning unary comparator could<br>&gt;         allow you to implement anything but lowerBound. With a three-value<br>&gt;         result, however, you&#39;ve got all you need.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         I&#39;ve shamelessly plugged before but for the sake of proving a point,<br>&gt;         I&#39;ll do it once more: I think this little library we did works as a good<br>&gt;         starting point for a stdlib binary search API:<br>&gt;         https://github.com/knomi/Allsorts/blob/master/Allsorts/BinarySearch.swift<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         — Pyry<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     _______________________________________________<br>&gt;     swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;     swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;     https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
