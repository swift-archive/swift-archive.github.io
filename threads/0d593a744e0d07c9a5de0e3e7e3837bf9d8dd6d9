Because native error handling already has been introduced in Swift 2, and failable initializer indeed could be achieved by following codes:<br></p><p>	class AClass {<br>		init() throws {<br>			// initialize and throw error when failed<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>	let anInstance = try? AClass()<br></p><p>And you can get the reason why the initialization was failed to guide your following recovering by using codes below, which is not able to be done with failable initializer:<br></p><p>	do { <br>		let anInstance = try AClass()<br>	} catch let error {<br>		// recover from the error<br>	}<br></p><p>Probably the heaviest impact to current code done by removing failable initializer is the consequential changes of NSCoding protocol’s designated initializer.<br></p><p>As NSCoding protocol defines a designated initializer which unarchives the object graph from the archived data which could be invalid (by a wrong treating during a previous encoding), expired (by a software upgrade) or corrupted (by a disk error or user corrupting), the initialization might be failed respectively. But according the Objective-C’s design, such a failure is implicit and no error info would be thrown. So for NSCoding defined initializers implemented in Objective-C, it should add a default error to them when bridging them to Swift if the failable initializer was removed and the designated initializer in NSCoding was re-defined with an initializer throws error info.<br></p><p>How do you guys think of that?<br></p><p>Thanks for reading.<br></p><p>WeZZard<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151227/0d59d6d9/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/831ba6eb600af4a6587f263373921bb2?s=50"></div><header><strong>Failable Initializer Suggestion</strong> from <string>Tino Heth</string> &lt;2th at gmx.de&gt;<p>December 27, 2015 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; How do you guys think of that?<br>Makes sense.<br>Failable init has its roots in Objective-C, throws is a better fit for Swift — but it is not trivial to change all Cocoa class to throw instead of returning nil (at least in theory — most likely many classes don&#39;t have that many reasons for a possible error).<br>Imho failable init should be removed again (but in a timeframe beyond the normal range of this list ;-)<br></p><p>Tino<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151227/70a55a79/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>Failable Initializer Suggestion</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>December 27, 2015 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Dec 27, 2015, at 5:22 AM, Manfred Lau via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; I just found that the design of failable initializer is redundant in Swift 2.
