The Apple developer publications team is interested in fixing this at some point, but doesn’t have a timeline and has some other higher priority tasks.  In the meantime, I’d suggest filing radars against bugreporter.apple.com with suggested change.  It certainly isn’t an ideal process, but it is at least one that will work for now.<br></p><p>-Chris<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
