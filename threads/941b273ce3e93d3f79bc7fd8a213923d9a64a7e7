Generally the best answer is restructure your code not to cause the exception to be thrown in the first place. There are unfortunately some APIs for which that&#39;s not possible, but if you must handle ObjC exceptions, I&#39;d recommend doing so from ObjC code rather than from Swift.<br></p><p>-Joe<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160324/332bc223/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd033b3ed46d65c7d7394eab52d53e6b?s=50"></div><header><strong>Catching NSException</strong> from <string>Evan Maloney</string> &lt;emaloney at gilt.com&gt;<p>April  1, 2016 at 03:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Hi Jon,<br></p><p>I ran into a similar situation and needed a way to not only catch NSExceptions from Swift, but throw them as well.
