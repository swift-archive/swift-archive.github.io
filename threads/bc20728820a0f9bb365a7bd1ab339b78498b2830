The type of it is of course Notification.Name.<br></p><p>One thing we did in the short term to make this feature even remotely possible was to add an importer rule: global const NSStrings that end in ‘Notification’ are imported as Notification.Name.something — otherwise everyone would have to either cast these, or we’d have to audit the whole SDK to add an attribute to each one.<br></p><p>I think we can probably do a better job of putting these where they belong with a combination of setting the attribute and using either API notes or the NS_SWIFT_NAME macro to get them into the right scope.
