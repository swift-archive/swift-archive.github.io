The “Versioned API” design is for testing a run-time property—it’s asking whether, dynamically, a particular library version is available (#available) or can be assumed available (@available) across the whole process. Since the Swift 4 compiler will use one runtime and standard library whether it’s in 3 mode or 4 mode, checking a run-time property isn’t the semantics we want. This proposal is concerned with the Swift language version at the time of compilation, and only for this particular module. (That’s also why there’s no #available component to the proposal.)<br></p><p>Thanks for bringing this up.<br>Jordan<br></p><p><br>&gt; On Sep 26, 2016, at 10:06, Ben Rimmington via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Re: &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0141-available-by-swift-version.md&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Is the &quot;Versioned API&quot; design in docs/LibraryEvolution.rst not intended for the Swift standard library?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &lt;https://jrose-apple.github.io/swift-library-evolution/#using-versioned-api&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &lt;https://jrose-apple.github.io/swift-library-evolution/#publishing-versioned-api&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- Ben<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
