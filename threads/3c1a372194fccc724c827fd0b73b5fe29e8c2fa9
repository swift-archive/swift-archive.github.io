I<br>&gt; finally found that FloatingPoint has added a rounded()<br>&gt; method. Creating a conflict with my rounded property (I presume). So<br>&gt; removed my extension and changed all of the accesses of rounded to be<br>&gt; calls to rounded(), as well as change the rounded properties I had<br>&gt; made for my own Angle and Duration enums for to rounded() methods for<br>&gt; consistencies sake.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Chapter 3:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; At this point, I felt a bit like a Sneetch (Dr Seuss). I was basically<br>&gt; shuffling empty parens around my code base to make the new version<br>&gt; happy.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I realize it can probably never be black and white, but is there at<br>&gt; least some guidelines as to when a property ought to be a niladic<br>&gt; method, and when a niladic method ought to be a property?<br></p><p>These were the (unfortunately somewhat fuzzy) conclusions of the Swift<br>API guidelines working group when we tried to tackle the issue, FWIW:<br></p><p>https://gist.github.com/dabrahams/b6b79f19c2bf9b2a0083<br></p><p>HTH,<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
