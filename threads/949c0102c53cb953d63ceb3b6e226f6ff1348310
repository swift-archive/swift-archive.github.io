Re: your comment about labels &lt;https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1613?focusedCommentId=14864&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14864&gt;:<br></p><p>&gt; By the way, I&#39;m curious for your thoughts on the swift-3.0 label, which I introduced in https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-corelibs-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160516/000662.html. I&#39;ve seen you &quot;curate&quot; labels in the past, so I hope I didn&#39;t step on your toes by creating one. I tagged this task as &quot;swift-3.0&quot; because it&#39;s a sub-task of SR-710 &lt;https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-710&gt;, which is also marked &quot;swift-3.0&quot; – we want to be able to generate tests lists before shipping corelibs-xctest.<br></p><p><br>I knocked the &quot;swift-3.0” label off because this was the first time I’d seen it in a non-corelibs issue, and because I wasn’t sure we had committed to doing this particular subtask in Swift 3—or rather, I wasn’t sure the SourceKit team had committed to doing this in Swift 3. I feel weird having release labels assigned by people working in other parts of the project because it feels like forcing the SourceKit engineers to fix it. I know that (a) wasn’t your intention, and (b) is probably accurate—as in, if this alternate solution hadn’t come up someone would have had to do something—but I reacted to it anyway and removed the label.<br></p><p>I do think now it was a bit of a knee-jerk reaction, so I apologize. As you noted, I’ve generally been the one adding labels, and removing or standardizing some of the ad hoc ones input by issue reporters; in this particular case that led to an instinct to remove a label I hadn’t seen rather than thinking about it. Certainly active contributors should be able to introduce new labels they find useful.<br></p><p>SR-1613 is resolved, so it’s kind of a moot point now, but do feel free to add useful labels in the future. If it matches one I’ve seen before I might standardize it, but I won’t remove them. Or if I do I’ll at least comment about it. :-)<br></p><p>Jordan<br></p><p>P.S. “swift-3.0” also doesn’t match my naming convention for labels, which is UpperCamelCase, but given that I didn’t write it down anywhere or tell anybody I can hardly complain!<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-corelibs-dev/attachments/20160526/949c8310/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f921fa5d507b31ef6984fd3d77ae710c?s=50"></div><header><strong>JIRA labels (no worries)</strong> from <string>Brian Gesiak</string> &lt;modocache at gmail.com&gt;<p>May 27, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Hey Jordan,<br></p><p>Thanks for the email!
