For example, web servers are often built in Java using these techniques. You define a (plain) class that represents a service, whose methods represent individual request endpoints:<br></p><p>@Service(root=&quot;/my/sub/webapp/&quot;)<br>class<br>MyWebapp<br>{<br>    @Get(path=&quot;users/{id}/&quot;)<br>    func getUsers(@Param(&quot;id&quot;) userID inUserID: Int)<br>	-&gt; [String:AnyObject]?<br>    {<br>	//  return dictionary for user with ID inUserID<br>    }<br>}<br></p><p>The container uses introspection to find all classes annotated with &quot;Service.&quot; It pulls the values of the parameters out of the Service annotation using introspection. It then does a similar thing on the methods in the Service class, etc.<br></p><p>Is there any work being done along these lines?<br></p><p><br>-- <br>Rick Mann<br>rmann at latencyzero.com<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>Java-style annotations (attributes?)</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>September 27, 2016 at 08:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Sep 27, 2016, at 5:02 PM, Rick Mann via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I did a little googling, but didn&#39;t find this specific question being asked.
