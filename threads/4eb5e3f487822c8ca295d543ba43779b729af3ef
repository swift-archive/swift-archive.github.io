This will allow for server architecture to transmit binary archives across the wire. This will mean that we will want to have the encoded class names from the application scope to be encoded as the non mangled name but with the namespace. However this presents a problem; Foundation will have a namespace which will need to be inferred both for encoding and decoding.

It might be good to mock up a swift translation layer for these APIs to simulate what it would be like on Darwin if we altered these to be renamed in swift and presented with a better interface via the SDK overlays. Note: this will have to go through our evolution proposal system and be weighed in by the component owners of NSKeyedArchiver and the API teams associated with that to make such a change.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In my opinion since AnyClass should be unique it by nature should be Hashable - however I am not certain we can actually do that without language changes.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Perhaps for the time being we could alter the signatures to be:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; public func decodeObjectOfClasses(classes: [AnyClass], forKey key: String) -&gt; AnyObject?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; public var allowedClasses: [AnyClass]?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Dec 25, 2015, at 2:01 AM, Luke Howard via swift-corelibs-dev &lt;swift-corelibs-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Looking at decodeObjectOfClasses/allowedClasses – what is the element type in the set of allowed classes?
