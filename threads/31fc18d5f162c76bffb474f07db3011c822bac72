None of<br>this needs a Mac.<br></p><p>https://github.com/AE9RB/SwiftGL<br></p><p>If you simply want to make iPhone apps then buying a Mac is the only<br>option. But if you wanted to play with graphics on Swift before committing<br>to a purchase, SwiftGL can give you a taste. Although the *Kit libraries<br>from Apple are far more comprehensive than SwiftGL which is an unfunded<br>one-man show right now.<br></p><p>-david<br></p><p>On Sat, Feb 13, 2016 at 10:09 AM, Rich De Steno via swift-users &lt;<br>swift-users at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; I have created and circulated over years several games for Windows written<br>&gt; in the C++ language.
