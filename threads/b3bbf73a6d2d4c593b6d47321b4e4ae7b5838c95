While it sounds like what&#39;s there now hasn&#39;t been<br>kept up to date for a while[1], that brought up the question if there could<br>ever be a dedicated repository for vim support under the apple github<br>organization.<br></p><p>Many vim plugin managers expect a specific folder structure[2] in order to<br>work correctly. So the current nesting of the vim support in the main repo<br>isn&#39;t ideal. I think it would be hugely beneficial to the members of the<br>community who would prefer to use vim over any other editor, for there to be a<br>first party repo similar to rust&#39;s[3].<br></p><p>I&#39;m not particularly suggesting that this plugin would be supported by the<br>swift core team. As there are at least a few community swift vim plugins<br>now[4][5] I would hope that as a community we would be willing and able to<br>support this plguin. Personally I would love to be part of a unified effort<br>towards better vim support for Swift!<br></p><p><br>Thoughts?

It provides a bunch of features like compiling and running the current file when you press âŒ˜R. It&#39;s not entirely up-to-date yet (e.g. I haven&#39;t updated it to allow string literals inside of string interpolations) but it works pretty well. It also doesn&#39;t have custom indentation support (I&#39;m using autoindent and smartindent), but it works pretty well for most things except switch cases.<br></p><p>That said, I did recently stop using it in favor of the one in the Swift repo for the simple reason that my plugin isn&#39;t compatible with .gyb files (my plugin defines a complex nested syntax hierarchy, which allows it to detect a lot of invalid syntax, but the gyb syntax can&#39;t work with that). I have been thinking about switching back to mine for normal files and only using the Swift repo one for .gyb files though.<br></p><p>In any case, I also support the notion of having an &quot;official&quot; plugin in its own repo, and I would suggest that using something like mine as the base might be nice.<br></p><p>-Kevin Ballard<br></p><p>On Thu, Dec 31, 2015, at 08:32 PM, Harlan Haskins via swift-dev wrote:<br>&gt; I love vim and would love to see static analyzer and SPM-aware vim support. +1 from me.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; On Dec 31, 2015, at 6:11 PM, Dmitri Gribenko via swift-dev &lt;swift-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; On Thu, Dec 31, 2015 at 10:09 PM, Keith Smiley via swift-dev<br>&gt; &gt; &lt;swift-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Hey all,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; <br>&gt; &gt;&gt; When swift was open sourced a few of us noticed that there was some existing<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; vim highlighting support[0].
