Would this be something useful for others then me?<br></p><p>   It seems the technical issue is solvable by adding a switch to the <br>git-notifier:<br>&quot;--allchanges &lt;branches&gt;<br>    Lists branches for which /all/ changes made to them should be mailed<br>    out as straight diffs to their previous state, independent of<br>    whether the corresponding commit has already been reported in the<br>    past. For merge commits, the mails include the full diff (i.e.,<br>    git&#39;s diff -m). This might for example make sense for master if one<br>    wants to closely track any modification applied. &lt;branches&gt; is a<br>    list of comma-separated names of heads to treat this way.  &quot;<br></p><p>Vassil<br>On 22/06/16 00:53, Slava Pestov wrote:<br>&gt; Hi Vassil,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Since a merge commit has two parents you might potentially want to diff against, I&#39;m assuming the tool is not smart enough to know which one is the PR and which one is trunk.
