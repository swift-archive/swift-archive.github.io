I would *much* rather keep this stuff corralled<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a single namespace where it can all be found.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; See? That, I totally get.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you represented it just fine, thanks... I just don&#39;t think<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you&#39;re accounting for the big picture.  These APIs are not like “map,”<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “filter,” and “Dictionary.”  They&#39;re specialty items that you should<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only reach for when performing unsafe operations, mostly inside the guts<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of higher-level constructs.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -- <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dave<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Would you like me to edit it and flip the proposal then? Put the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; MemoryLayout in as primary, mine as secondary, and add in text to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; explain that the motivation is less usability than serving an unsafe<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; API with minimal surface area?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Well, the review has already started, so I don&#39;t think we ought to go<br>&gt;&gt; inverting the proposal now.  Let&#39;s see how the discussion plays out.  If<br>&gt;&gt; at the end, you agree with my point-of-view, you can say so and the<br>&gt;&gt; review manager and core team will take that into account.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; No, I&#39;d do edits on a gist page not in-place<br></p><p>Then feel free, of course!
