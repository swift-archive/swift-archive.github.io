A lot of us have not encountered an<br>issue with the current behaviour. We end up with more concise code because<br>of it. Those who are worried about this behaviour can follow a practice of<br>adding `self.` in front of all their instance members. This is no different<br>from having confusingly named functions or variables.<br></p><p>* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes in the sense that it errs on the side of greater safety. But leaning<br>too much in that direction can lead to unnecessary changes with very small<br>upsides. I don&#39;t think the problem is big enough to warrant a language<br>change.<br></p><p>* If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar feature,<br>how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>I have not, but I have enjoyed having `self.` be optional in the Swift code<br>I&#39;ve written so far.<br></p><p>* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading,<br>or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>I have quickly reviewed the arguments on the two sides by going through the<br>archives.<br></p><p>Hirad<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151216/ee14f347/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
