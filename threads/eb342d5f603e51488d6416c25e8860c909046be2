To do that reliably I want to be able to measure how long it takes to execute specific methods.<br></p><p>On OSX I&#39;m using mach_absolute_time() that I&#39;ve wrapped in a struct for easier interaction and it works fine. Now I&#39;d like to do the same tests on a copy of my actual platform that runs Ubuntu 15.10.<br></p><p>Mach0 library that I use is not available on Linux, instead I could use gettimeofday or clock_gettime. For that I would have to expose time.h to my swift code, however I&#39;m unsure how to do it exactly.<br>I have started putting my timing struct in a swift package as a first step. Now I&#39;m stuck and here are my questions:<br>    * How exactly do I use clang&#39;s modulemap with package manager?<br>    * How do I make modulemap include time.h only on Linux?<br>    * Is it necessary to include full path to time.h header or I can omit it in case of system headers?<br></p><p>Here is a link to my package for future reference (no linux code there for now).<br>https://github.com/michalkalinowski-/Timer<br></p><p>Also, if anyone is aware of a package that uses C library in place of OSX C method to work cross-platform please let me know. It would be a great guidance for me as I have a very vague idea of how package manager and C libs import work.<br></p><p>Regards,<br>M.
