IIUC,<br>one of the primary reasons the Swift core team accepted SE-0029 (remove<br>implicit tuple splat) is because it adds a lot of complexity to the<br>typechecker.  That was my experience too, having implemented a hobby<br>language several years ago where every function took a single tuple<br>argument.  It made it very difficult to reason about the types in the<br>program, because a function type held no intrinsic type information, and<br>the only way to typecheck it was to know how the function was defined and<br>see whether that was compatible with how it was invoked.  That, in turn,<br>made first-class functions and separate module compilation very difficult:<br>you had to carry around full information about the arity of the tuple, each<br>of its types, whether the types were generic type variables, whether they<br>had typeclass (protocol in Swift) constraints, whether the typeclasses<br>themselves had associated types, etc.  And then when you try to *infer*<br>types, each of these become cases in the inference engine, and interacted<br>combinatorially.<br></p><p>I&#39;d start by trying to write down the type of the splat operator.  Can it<br>be expressed within the normal Swift type system?  I&#39;m not sure...I&#39;m not<br>familiar enough with the intricacies of Swift tuple types to know.<br></p><p>If it can&#39;t, I have a strong preference against the options (#1 &amp; #2) that<br>look like normal function call syntax.  Because you won&#39;t be able to do<br>several things that you&#39;re accustomed to with functions: assign them to<br>variables, store them in containers, pass them as parameters to other<br>functions.<br></p><p>This is less of a problem with explicit language syntax, because you could<br>have a rule in the typechecker that says &quot;If the expression being splatted<br>is a tuple of type (A, B, x: C), then it must be applied to a function of<br>type (A, B, C) -&gt; Ret, with the result type of the call being Ret.&quot;  I<br>think you can also get around many of the type inference pitfalls as well,<br>because in most cases the types of the function and tuple are unlikely to<br>need inferring (occasionally this will require explicit type annotations on<br>tuple components, but it seems like most of the time they will have already<br>been inferred when the tuple was declared).  And it&#39;s much easier to do<br>&quot;partial splat&quot; operations, where, for example, you may want to pass the<br>first couple arguments of a function explicitly but splat the rest.<br></p><p>Note that there&#39;s a loss of expressiveness through *not* making the splat<br>operator first-class; a number of interesting Haskell combinators come out<br>of using $ (the function-application operator) as a function that can<br>itself be passed around.  But it&#39;s also a question of how much complexity<br>you want to add to the language for the sake of conceptual purity.

Many of those edge cases can be avoided by saying &quot;This is a<br>simple syntactic feature, it *looks* like this but all it does is construct<br>a closure that&#39;s syntactic sugar for applying this function to each of the<br>components of its tuple-based argument.&quot;  But then if it looks like a<br>method, people are going to wonder why they can&#39;t pass it to a function or<br>store it in a data-structure.<br></p><p>I *did* consider adding a fourth option, that of annotating parameters as<br>&gt; converting n-ary functions to tuple-taking equivalents, but I didn&#39;t feel<br>&gt; like I had a good enough idea of how that would work to really suggest it.<br>&gt; Roughly, an `apply(_:to:)` function would look something like this:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         func apply&lt;In, Out&gt;(function: @splatting In -&gt; Out, to params: In)<br>&gt; -&gt; Out {<br>&gt;                 // `function` is of type `In -&gt; Out`, where In is a tuple<br>&gt; containing the types<br>&gt;                 // of the parameters of the function that was passed.<br>&gt; Essentially, the generic system<br>&gt;                 // implicitly wraps the function in a trampoline that<br>&gt; takes a tuple of compatible arguments.<br>&gt;                 return function(params)<br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; But this starts getting deep into type checker and generic system<br>&gt; territory, which I don&#39;t understand well enough to feel comfortable<br>&gt; proposing.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; If it can&#39;t, I have a strong preference against the options (#1 &amp; #2)<br>&gt; that look like normal function call syntax.  Because you won&#39;t be able to<br>&gt; do several things that you&#39;re accustomed to with functions: assign them to<br>&gt; variables, store them in containers, pass them as parameters to other<br>&gt; functions.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I think this feature has to be able to make a first-class, tuple-taking<br>&gt; closure, and all three alternatives I presented are intended to do that.<br>&gt; That&#39;s what the second example for each syntax (the one where I map it over<br>&gt; an array of tuples) is meant to show.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This is less of a problem with explicit language syntax, because you<br>&gt; could have a rule in the typechecker that says &quot;If the expression being<br>&gt; splatted is a tuple of type (A, B, x: C), then it must be applied to a<br>&gt; function of type (A, B, C) -&gt; Ret, with the result type of the call being<br>&gt; Ret.&quot;  I think you can also get around many of the type inference pitfalls<br>&gt; as well, because in most cases the types of the function and tuple are<br>&gt; unlikely to need inferring (occasionally this will require explicit type<br>&gt; annotations on tuple components, but it seems like most of the time they<br>&gt; will have already been inferred when the tuple was declared).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As long as the splatting is explicit—that is, the parser can tell whether<br>&gt; you&#39;re making a normal call or a tuple call—I don&#39;t think the overload<br>&gt; resolution on a splatted version of a function is any more difficult than<br>&gt; the non-splatted version. Possibly even easier, depending on how we handle<br>&gt; default arguments.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; And it&#39;s much easier to do &quot;partial splat&quot; operations, where, for<br>&gt; example, you may want to pass the first couple arguments of a function<br>&gt; explicitly but splat the rest.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I haven&#39;t really considered how to do this kind of thing, but I think it&#39;s<br>&gt; probably better represented by constructing a single tuple containing all<br>&gt; of the arguments. I believe there was another thread recently that<br>&gt; discussed tuple combining operators.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>I saw that, briefly.

What happens if a protocol defines &quot;func apply(to:)&quot;?  Is that legal?  Would function types automatically conform to the protocol?<br></p><p>For `apply(to:)`, it really would just be a method available on function types. You could put an `apply(to:)` method on any other type, and it wouldn&#39;t have any effect on things. You could declare a protocol with `apply(to:)`, but it wouldn&#39;t do anything to any function types. Conceptually, there would only be a few special things about them:<br></p><p>1. The compiler generates the `apply(to:)` methods automatically. We could, perhaps, have it generate a conformance to an `Applicable` protocol like this one, but that&#39;s probably overkill:<br></p><p>	protocol Applicable {<br>		typealias ReturnValue<br>		typealias ArgumentTuple<br>		func apply(to: ArgumentTuple) -&gt; ReturnValue<br>	}<br></p><p>(Actually, as I think about this, I wonder if `Applicable` could give us the `@splatting` property for free: take a generic parameter on Applicable and someone can specify a bare function, but you can&#39;t call it directly, only through its `apply(to:)` method.)<br></p><p>2. If `fn` is overloaded, `fn.apply(x)` will end up selecting an `fn` overload based on the type of `x`.
