But do you guys think we could remove this<br>&quot;subscript&quot; prefix? Could we actually bring subscripts closer to<br>computed properties by doing something like &quot;var self[externaName<br>internalName : ParamType] : ElemenType&quot;? That could also support the<br>idea of creating named subscripts by replacing self with another name.<br></p><p>L<br></p><p><br>On 20 July 2016 at 14:17, Jose Cheyo Jimenez via swift-evolution<br>&lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Jul 20, 2016, at 7:51 AM, Vladimir.S via swift-evolution<br>&gt; &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; +1 to clean up the syntax of subscripts. They acts as properties, not<br>&gt; methods, so it is natural to express them with `:` and not with `-&gt;`.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Actually, I&#39;d prefer additional change to use [] instead of () in<br>&gt; declaration like:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; subscript[externalName internalName: ParamType] : ElementType {<br>&gt;    get { â€¦ }<br>&gt;    set { â€¦ }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I got to second this suggestion. To me this is an elegant solution.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If subscripts are so special that Swift decided to give it its own name (as<br>&gt; oppose to just making it two functions),<br>&gt; why not declare it in a special way like the above?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I think that in addition to replacing -&gt; with : if we replaced () with []<br>&gt; then it would be much clearer that this is not a function or property.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; subscript[externalName internalName: ParamType] : ElementType {<br>&gt;    get { â€¦ }<br>&gt;    set { â€¦ }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I donâ€™t see another place in the language where [] would make more sense<br>&gt; than here:<br>&gt; Otherwise I donâ€™t see  replacing -&gt; with : as a big win like Dmitri Gribenko<br>&gt; said down thread -&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I think by changing subscripts to use colons we would end in the opposite,<br>&gt; but<br>&gt; totally symmetrical situation compared to what we have now.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; especially if thinking about &quot;Future directions&quot; and confusion with<br>&gt; parameterised accessor syntax(both declared with `()` but first used with<br>&gt; `[]` and second with `()`).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On 20.07.2016 8:50, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The review of &quot;SE-0122: Use colons for subscript declarations &quot; begins now<br>&gt; and runs through July 24.
