Is there any reason this *wouldn’t* be feasible?<br>&gt;     _______________________________________________<br>&gt;     swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;     swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;     https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
