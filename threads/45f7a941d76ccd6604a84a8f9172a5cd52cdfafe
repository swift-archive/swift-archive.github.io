C-family<br>languages, at least per documentation. One specific example--this<br>statement in C:<br>```<br>v = v + (v &gt;&gt; 4) &amp; 0x0F0F0F0F;<br>```<br>is evaluated in a different order (at least, per documentation) from<br>this statement in Swift:<br>```<br>v = v &amp;+ (v &gt;&gt; 4) &amp; 0x0F0F0F0F<br>```<br></p><p>In C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Perl, Scala (these are the ones I&#39;ve just<br>checked), infix + has higher precedence than infix bitwise &amp;, but in<br>Swift the bitwise &amp; operator has multiplicative precedence 150 while +<br>has precedence 140. Meanwhile, bitshift operators &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; are<br>documented to have exponentiative precedence 160 in Swift, higher than<br>* / + -, which is not seen in other languages. Is this an intentional<br>deviation with some rationale not documented somewhere? Can we change<br>it back? [I know I can change it on a per-file basis, but the point<br>here is that, for a C-style language, having different results for<br>innocuous-looking statements with these operators seems to be a little<br>too easy a pitfall to step in.]<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>Standard operator precedence</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>February 13, 2016 at 08:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Feb 13, 2016, at 6:32 AM, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Not sure if this is intentional, a bug, and/or a topic for evolution:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In Swift, bitwise operators seem to have a different precedence in<br>&gt; relation to other operators than they do in (all other?)

It&#39;s not a feature anyone would clamor for, more a product of the<br>&gt; foolish consistency hobgoblin. Rationale: it is possible in JavaScript (for<br>&gt; instance) to evaluate true * true, but not in Swift. [I&#39;m aware that<br>&gt; implicit casting is taking place in JavaScript, and that the return type<br>&gt; isn&#39;t a Boolean.] It comes into play in exactly one scenario I can think of:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Student: &quot;Why is &amp; a multiplicative operation?&quot;<br>&gt; Teacher: &quot;Well, because for two bits A and B, A &amp; B == A * B.&quot;<br>&gt; Student: &quot;That&#39;s interesting, let me try it with the only type I know that<br>&gt; represents a single bit of data.&quot;<br>&gt; [At this point the student should, IMO, be able to actually evaluate A * B<br>&gt; where A and B are booleans.]<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Analogous rationale for defining &amp;+ and &amp;- on booleans.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Mon, Feb 15, 2016 at 12:20 PM Chris Lattner &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; On Feb 14, 2016, at 10:25 AM, Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Some further study has been helpful.

(However, those languages<br>&gt;&gt; also seem to lack documentation on how they arrived at this set of<br>&gt;&gt; precedence levels.)<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; - It is quite evident why &lt;&lt; is considered exponentiative.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; - Dennis Ritchie has explained &lt;<br>&gt;&gt; http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/dmr-on-or.html&gt; why &amp; has lower precedence<br>&gt;&gt; than == in C, and why in hindsight that is better off changed. This change<br>&gt;&gt; has been implemented in Swift/Go/Erlang and also in other languages like<br>&gt;&gt; Python.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; - &amp; is considered multiplicative because for two bits A and B, A &amp; B == A<br>&gt;&gt; * B.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; - ^ and | should have equal precedence to - and +, respectively, by<br>&gt;&gt; analogous reasoning.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; - It also happens to be rational for &amp; to have higher precedence than |<br>&gt;&gt; by analogy with &amp;&amp; and ||.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Yep, this is all right.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; It&#39;s a bit of a bummer, if this line of reasoning was indeed used in<br>&gt;&gt; arriving at these operator precedence levels, that Swift will not allow<br>&gt;&gt; evaluation of true * true (etc.) without casting. I would expect true &amp;<br>&gt;&gt; true == true * true.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I’m not sure what you mean here.  You want multiplication defined on<br>&gt;&gt; booleans?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; -Chris<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160215/3d35440d/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
