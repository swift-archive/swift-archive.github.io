He makes Clojure look<br>so obvious, wonderful and simple (not easy!). He also makes the<br>conventional languages/ways look so unnecessarily complex, convoluted and<br>bad.<br>Like in this talk:<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSdnJDO-xdg<br>My favorite part is Death by Specificity ~49 minutes in.<br></p><p>I&#39;d like to see more things like that for Swift, showing off the language<br>and motivating its design decisions. There&#39;s of course the great WWDC 2015<br>talk Protocol Oriented Programming in Swift by Dave Abrahams. And the other<br>one about value types. I&#39;ve also seen a few very interesting talks and<br>articles about SIL and optimization, etc. But any pointers to more such<br>material would be highly appreciated.<br></p><p>It would also be interesting to hear people on this list compare the design<br>of Swift to that of some other new languages (eg Clojure, Elm or Rust).<br></p><p>For example:<br></p><p>Why didn&#39;t Swift go with S-expressions / homoiconicity? What would the<br>cost/benefits have been?<br></p><p>How does Swift tackle the problem of Death by Specificity mentioned in the<br>talk above?<br></p><p>/Jens<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160206/04ffdc80/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
