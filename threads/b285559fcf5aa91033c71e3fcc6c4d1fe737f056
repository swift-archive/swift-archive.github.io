The proposal is available here:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0052-iterator-post-nil-guarantee.md<br></p><p><br>• What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>I&#39;m -1.<br></p><p>I agree with Patrick Pijnappel that it is too easy to write code that assumes that iterators end with nil for good, and breaks when this assumption happens to be false.<br></p><p>I agree as well that the precondition that when calling next(), no preceding call to next() should have returned nil is not observed enough.<br></p><p>I agree that algorithms need guarantees and API contracts.<br></p><p>Yet I have three arguments against the proposal:<br></p><p>1. Obscurity argument: Both the existing precondition, and the proposed convention are non-enforceable, non-testable, not well-known enough, and generally too weak to be efficient in any way. People don&#39;t write custom iterators often enough, and I don&#39;t expect those rules to eventually percolate through Swift culture.<br></p><p>2. Social argument: when a user complains that my library crashes when fed with a third-party iterator that does not behave, I, as a library author, have better make my code robust and accept non-conforming iterators than whining about the third-party. It&#39;s just faster and more efficient.<br></p><p>3. Iterator autonomy argument : Iterator is easily seen as a type that exists to support Sequence. In this case, we&#39;d like Iterator to end for good (finite sequence), or never end (infinite sequence). However, one could argue that Iterator is an autonomous type that happens to support Sequence, but may have other uses, like message queues. In such a context, requiring post-nil guarantees has no meaning.<br></p><p>I&#39;d thus remove the existing precondition, and support the following alternatives:<br></p><p>- the FuseIterator Patrick&#39;s proposal (and we could discuss its name).<br>- a new StoppingIterator protocol which does explicitly provide the post-nil guarantee. Algorithms could then use this guarantee.<br></p><p><br>• Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes, because algorithms need guarantees and API contracts. I&#39;m totally with the proposal author here. But I don&#39;t think the proposed changes are the right solution.<br></p><p><br>• If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>This proposal has opened my eyes on a subtle problem with iterators that had not yet bitten me in any language I have used before. Or if it had, I guess just made my code more robust without much second thought.<br></p><p><br>• How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>The best I could to expose my points :-)<br></p><p>Gwendal Roué<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160429/c0a31720/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a06dd7924588141b9c907543798c2524?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0052: Change IteratorType post-nil guarantee</strong> from <string>Gwendal Roué</string> &lt;gwendal.roue at gmail.com&gt;<p>April 29, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Le 29 avr. 2016 à 08:18, Gwendal Roué &lt;gwendal.roue at gmail.com&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The review of &quot;SE-0052: Change IteratorType post-nil guarantee&quot; begins now and runs through May 3. The proposal is available here:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0052-iterator-post-nil-guarantee.md &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0052-iterator-post-nil-guarantee.md&gt;<br>&gt; I&#39;d thus […] support the following alternatives:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - the FuseIterator Patrick&#39;s proposal (and we could discuss its name).<br>&gt; - a new StoppingIterator protocol which does explicitly provide the post-nil guarantee. Algorithms could then use this guarantee.<br></p><p>Actually, a StoppingIterator protocol is not a good idea, because this concept should go up the type hierarchy up to Collection in order to let sequence and collection methods use static type information in order to choose the correct iterator algorithm.<br></p><p>I&#39;d prefer a FuseIterator that eventually returns nil forever as soon as it underlying iterator returns nil. Yes, fuseIterator would not apply the &quot;when calling next(), no preceding call to next() should have returned nil&quot; precondition. This precondition would be removed from the Iterator documentation. The FuseIterator would be the easy-going iterator, the one that has no surprise, and makes it easy to write algorithms.<br></p><p>When one needs a &quot;simple&quot; iterator, one just has to derive a FuseIterator from it. Its implementation could look like:<br></p><p>struct FuseIterator&lt;Element&gt; : Iterator {<br>    let baseNext: () -&gt; Element?<br>    var ended: Bool = false<br>    init&lt;I: Iterator where G.Element == Element&gt;(_ baseIterator: I) {<br>        var baseIterator = baseIterator<br>        baseNext = { baseIterator.next() }<br>    }<br>    mutating func next() -&gt; Element? {<br>        if ended {<br>            return nil<br>        } else if let element = baseNext() {<br>            return element<br>        } else {<br>            ended = true<br>            return nil<br>        }<br>    }<br>}<br></p><p>We would maybe also need a FuseSequence, in order to iterate a wild base iterator with a `for` loop until its first nil.<br></p><p>Last, forgive my non-native English, but when I look at &quot;fuse&quot; in a Thesaurus, I don&#39;t quite see the meaning of &quot;consume until first exhaustion&quot;. It looks like any one of &quot;BoundedIterator&quot;, &quot;ClosedIterator&quot;, &quot;CompactIterator&quot;, &quot;TerminatingIterator&quot; would better communicate its nature. &quot;ClosedIterator&quot; looks like the new &quot;ClosedRange&quot; types introduced by SE-0065 and is my current favorite.<br></p><p>Gwendal Roué<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160429/1f909b31/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0052: Change IteratorType post-nil guarantee</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>April 29, 2016 at 05:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>I think it&#39;s a good idea.<br></p><p>This is a particularly sharp edge in the standard library: people have a completely reasonable expectation about `next()`&#39;s behavior which is usually, but not always, borne out.

I saw the gist that was used to come up with this 25% number. But I do have to ask, does the 25% increase still hold when talking about String.UTF8View, or is that significant speedup only shown when using the UTF8 type to transcode? And similarly, what&#39;s the effect on performance for non-ASCII input?<br></p><p>Similarly, do we have any numbers for the effect on performance for a custom Iterator that now has to track state which it otherwise wouldn&#39;t? TakeWhileIterator would be a good candidate for testing, except it hasn&#39;t been implemented yet (though it shouldn&#39;t be hard to whip up a sample implementation for that).<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. The current defined behavior is pretty much the worst of all options since it encourages library authors to deliberately crash, and yet no stdlib type actually does crash, so it makes it easy to write code that works for stdlib iterators but will fail when given a third-party iterator.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>Rust&#39;s equivalent Iterator type is defined such that after a previous call to next() has returned None, Iterators are allowed to return either None or Some(Item) from subsequent calls to next() (but shouldn&#39;t crash). And Rust has a FuseIterator (and a corresponding .fuse() method). This matches the first alternative in the proposal. And with this approach, it&#39;s true that it&#39;s extremely rare for people to call .fuse() (but this just demonstrates that very few people write code where post-nil behavior matters), but it does simplify many Iterator implementations, and AFAIK nobody&#39;s complained about this behavior.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review?

All<br>&gt; reviews should be sent to the swift-evolution mailing list at<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;       https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; or, if you would like to keep your feedback private, directly to the<br>&gt; review manager.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; What goes into a review?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review<br>&gt; through constructive criticism and, eventually, determine the direction of<br>&gt; Swift. When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to<br>&gt; answer in your review:<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;       * What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I was originally strongly -1 on this (as can be seen from my previous<br>&gt; messages on this ML about this topic), both for the reasons that Gwendal<br>&gt; Roué wrote as well as my belief that the vast majority of users never even<br>&gt; write code that hits this case at all and my own experience in that it&#39;s<br>&gt; actually more common for me as an author of a custom Iterator to have to<br>&gt; worry about meeting this guarantee than it is for anyone using my Iterator<br>&gt; to rely on the behavior.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; However, if there really is a 25% speedup on UTF-8 decoding for ASCII<br>&gt; input, that&#39;s a pretty significant point in favor of the change. I saw the<br>&gt; gist that was used to come up with this 25% number. But I do have to ask,<br>&gt; does the 25% increase still hold when talking about String.UTF8View, or is<br>&gt; that significant speedup only shown when using the UTF8 type to transcode?<br>&gt; And similarly, what&#39;s the effect on performance for non-ASCII input?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Similarly, do we have any numbers for the effect on performance for a<br>&gt; custom Iterator that now has to track state which it otherwise wouldn&#39;t?<br>&gt; TakeWhileIterator would be a good candidate for testing, except it hasn&#39;t<br>&gt; been implemented yet (though it shouldn&#39;t be hard to whip up a sample<br>&gt; implementation for that).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;       * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a<br>&gt; change to Swift?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes. The current defined behavior is pretty much the worst of all options<br>&gt; since it encourages library authors to deliberately crash, and yet no<br>&gt; stdlib type actually does crash, so it makes it easy to write code that<br>&gt; works for stdlib iterators but will fail when given a third-party iterator.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;       * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;       * If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar<br>&gt; feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Rust&#39;s equivalent Iterator type is defined such that after a previous call<br>&gt; to next() has returned None, Iterators are allowed to return either None or<br>&gt; Some(Item) from subsequent calls to next() (but shouldn&#39;t crash). And Rust<br>&gt; has a FuseIterator (and a corresponding .fuse() method). This matches the<br>&gt; first alternative in the proposal. And with this approach, it&#39;s true that<br>&gt; it&#39;s extremely rare for people to call .fuse() (but this just demonstrates<br>&gt; that very few people write code where post-nil behavior matters), but it<br>&gt; does simplify many Iterator implementations, and AFAIK nobody&#39;s complained<br>&gt; about this behavior.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;       * How much effort did you put into your review?
