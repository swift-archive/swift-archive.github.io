Foundation could also an extension on String which converts Range&lt;String.Index&gt; &lt;-&gt; NSRange so you can do explicit “bridging&quot;, since NSRange is a Foundation type. That’s what it currently does for NSRange&lt;Int&gt;?.<br></p><p>It would make life much easier for people only in Swift, and at the boundary with Obj-C — okay, it’s not really bridging as such, but is it really any more or less convenient to call a method than to perform an “as” cast? You might argue that it’s even more convenient to call a method, since you get code-completion telling you which Obj-C types you can bridge to (and possibly explaining why it’s unexpectedly an optional).<br></p><p>Karl<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160630/a07b644f/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecdb231117dda838340bfcbb8873d28e?s=50"></div><header><strong>Partial list of open Swift 3 design topics</strong> from <string>Paul Cantrell</string> &lt;cantrell at pobox.com&gt;<p>June 24, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>Way back when, there was an unresolved discussion was about whether it’s a bug or a feature that $0 sometimes captures a single arg and sometimes captures all args as a tuple:<br></p><p>    http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution/3915/<br>    https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-586<br></p><p>I mention this because it would be a breaking change to make $0 consistently capture the first arg, and I wonder whether that should be in the Swift 3?<br></p><p>(If anybody wants to comment on the question, I recommend catching up on the discussion in the links above first.)<br></p><p>Cheers, P<br></p><p><br>&gt; On Jun 22, 2016, at 8:07 PM, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hi everyone,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Here is a partial list of the open topics that the core team would like to get resolved in Swift 3.
