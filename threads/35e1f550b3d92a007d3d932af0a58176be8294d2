You could do this something like so:<br></p><p>// Reintroduce these methods that were lost in the new indexing API<br>protocol ForwardStep { func successor()? -&gt; Self }<br>protocol BackwardStep : ForwardStep { func predecessor()? -&gt; Self }<br></p><p>// Enable conversion of ranges<br>extend ClosedRange where Self.Bound : ForwardStep {<br>	func toOpenRange() -&gt; Range&lt;Self.Bound&gt;? {<br>		guard let upperBound = self.upperBound.successor() else { return nil }<br>		return self.lowerBound ..&lt; upperBound<br>	}<br>}<br>extend Range where Self.Bound : BackwardStep {<br>	func toClosedRange() -&gt; ClosedRange&lt;Self.Bound&gt;? {<br>		guard let upperBound = self.upperBound.predecessor() else { return nil }<br>		return self.lowerBound ... upperBound<br>	}<br>}<br>extend ClosedRange where Self.Bound : BackwardStep {<br>	init(_ openRange:Range&lt;Self.Bound&gt;)? {<br>		guard let closedRange = openRange.toClosedRange() else { return nil }<br>		self = closedRange<br>	}<br>}<br>extend Range where Self.Bound : ForwardStep {<br>	init(_ closedRange:Range&lt;Self.Bound&gt;)? {<br>		guard let openRange = closedRange.toClosedRange() else { return nil }<br>		self = openRange<br>	}<br>}<br></p><p>I&#39;ve rushed this a bit so forgive any glaring errors, but this is essentially how I&#39;d bolt this on right now myself. Basically it reintroduces some of the flexibility, but with the safety of optionals to avoid the previous problem of incrementing a maximum value, this shouldn&#39;t be a problem for performance since it&#39;s just being used for conversion.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160906/4bb37b71/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
