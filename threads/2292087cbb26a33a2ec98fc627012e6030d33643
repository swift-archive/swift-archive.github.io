And it&#39;s not something that will ever reasonably apply to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; anything except #file and #line. This feature is only ever intended to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; be used by tools that auto-generate source files. The most important<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; concerns here really should just be that whatever we use is trivial to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; generate correctly by even the simplest of tools and is readable. And<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; since this won&#39;t ever apply to anything beyond #file and #line,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; there&#39;s no need to try to generalize this feature at all.&quot;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; +1 for the idea, but...<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think we should make this change without also making the feature<br>&gt;&gt; useful for things like gyb, which has to use its own home-brew line<br>&gt;&gt; directive machinery because #line is AFAIK currently useless for any<br>&gt;&gt; known application.  The way it currently works you can only put the<br>&gt;&gt; directive at grammatical boundaries in the program where #if would also<br>&gt;&gt; work.  For #if this is a feature, but for #resetfilecontext it&#39;s a bug.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Isn&#39;t it the case that making this feature useful would require a lot<br>&gt;&gt; more than the simple syntactic shuffle being proposed here?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I completely disagree with this approach.  Making the existing feature<br>&gt; “more useful” is orthogonal from repainting it.  Getting the paint<br>&gt; right is a high priority for Swift 3, but making it “more useful” is<br>&gt; low priority.<br></p><p>Fair enough.  I suppose as long as it&#39;s useless any further changes<br>won&#39;t break much code anyhow ;-)<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
