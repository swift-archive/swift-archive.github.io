You are now allowed to declare static stored properties in classes, which have global storage and are lazily initialized on first access (like global variables). Protocols now declare type requirements as static requirements instead of declaring them as class requirements. (17198298)<br></p><p>If even the Swift team itself has difficulties in picking one from the<br>two and had to revert its initial decision after several revisions, we<br>know these keywords are indeed confusing.<br></p><p>So now protocols use `static` to declare type methods, when a class<br>adapts such protocols, should it implement those static methods, as<br>static methods or class methods?<br></p><p>But static means final, right? Does it mean we can not override these<br>methods in subclasses of the conforming class?<br></p><p>These kinds of unnecessary confusion and hesitation should be<br>resolved, and could if this proposal is implemented.<br></p><p>### Unnecessary and inconsistent differentiation<br></p><p>The `class` keyword is only used in classes. In the current<br>implementation of Swift the differences between `class` and `static`<br>are:<br></p><p>1. Class properties can only be calculated properties but not stored properties.<br>2. Class methods(also calculated properties) are dynamically<br>dispatched while static ones are statically dispatched.<br></p><p>If we can eliminate the differences or find better ways to<br>differentiate we can use one unified keyword instead for declaring<br>type properties and methods.<br></p><p>Let’s see.<br></p><p>#### Class stored properties VS. static stored properties<br></p><p>If you use the `class` keyword to declare a stored property in a class<br>you will get this compiling error:<br>&gt; class stored properties not yet supported in classes; did you mean &#39;static&#39;?<br></p><p>So what are class stored properties? How are they different from<br>static stored properties?<br></p><p>As far as I know, class stored properties, if ever implemented in<br>Swift, “would be what Ruby calls ‘class instance<br>variables’”.&lt;sup&gt;[1](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/status/584104757117095936)&lt;/sup&gt;<br></p><p>So what are class instance variables?<br></p><p>The best explanation I can find is this<br>[one](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ClassInstanceVariable.html) from<br>Martin Fowler.<br></p><p>Do we really want this feature in Swift? “If we didn&#39;t already have<br>these, would we add them to Swift 3?&quot;<br></p><p>I strongly believe we won’t add it to Swift 3. Actually I believe we<br>will never add it to Swift, because its use cases are so rare which is<br>also why it hasn’t been implemented so far in Swift.<br></p><p>If we agree we are not going to support class stored properties, there<br>is and will be only one kind of stored properties for types and we<br>only need one keyword to declare such properties.<br></p><p>#### Class methods VS. static methods<br></p><p>*Since calculated properties are also methods in essence they are also<br>covered by this section.*<br></p><p>The only difference is how methods are dispatched.<br></p><p>Let’s see [how we handle it for instance<br>methods](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=27):<br></p><p>* Methods are overridable hence dynamically dispatched by default.<br>* In performance critical code use these techniques to restrict this<br>dynamic behavior when it isn’t needed to improve performance:<br></p><p>    1. Use the `final` keyword when we know that a declaration does<br>not need to be overridden.<br>    2. Infer `final` on declarations referenced in one file by<br>applying the `private` keyword.<br>    3. Use `Whole Module Optimization` to infer `final` on `internal`<br>declarations.<br></p><p>So why abandon this whole system to use another totally different one<br>for differentiating `static dispatch` and `dynamic dispatch` for type<br>methods?<br></p><p>If we reuse this system for type methods, not only can we have a<br>consistent design for both instance and type methods, but also we can<br>get rid of the last place where two keywords for type member<br>declarations are needed.<br></p><p>## Proposed solution<br></p><p>1. Use the keyword `type` to declare type properties and methods.<br>2. Type properties and methods are overridable hence dynamically<br>dispatched by default. Use the `final` keyword or inferred `final` to<br>make them final and statically dispatched, just like instance<br>properties and methods.<br>3. Type properties can be stored or calculated, just like instance properties.<br></p><p>As you can see, it is a very simple and elegant design:<br></p><p>* Just a single keyword `type` to differentiate type member<br>declarations from instance member declarations. `type` is a good<br>keyword because:<br></p><p>    1. It is consistent with the wording of the concepts of `type<br>properties` and `type methods`.<br>    2. It is never used as a keyword before in Swift, Objective-C or<br>C. There will be no conflicts or overloading of it meanings.<br>* Except for that, how things are declared, differentiated and<br>optimized are exactly the same in both type and instance world. Very<br>consistent.<br></p><p>## Comparison with current design<br></p><p>* Dynamic Dispatch VS. Static Dispatch<br></p><p>```swift<br>// Old<br>class Foo {<br>    func dynamicInstanceMethod() {}<br>    final func staticInstanceMethod() {}<br></p><p>    class func dynamicTypeMethod() {}<br>    static func staticTypeMethod() {}<br>}<br>```<br></p><p>```swift<br>// New<br>class Foo {<br>    func dynamicInstanceMethod() {}<br>    final func staticInstanceMethod() {}<br></p><p>    type func dynamicTypeMethod() {}<br>    final type func staticTypeMethod() {}<br>}<br>```<br></p><p>* Stored Properties VS. Calculated Properties<br></p><p>```swift<br>// Old<br>class Bar {<br>    static let i = 1<br></p><p>    class var j: Int {<br>        return 1<br>    }<br>}<br>```<br></p><p>```swift<br>// New<br>class Bar {<br>    type let i = 1<br></p><p>    type var j: Int {<br>        return 1<br>    }<br>}<br>```<br></p><p>* Struct Implementation VS. Class Implementation of Protocol<br></p><p>```swift<br>// Old<br>protocol P {<br>    static func foo()<br>}<br></p><p>struct S: P {<br>    static func foo() {}<br>}<br></p><p>class C: P {<br>    class func foo() {}<br>}<br>```<br></p><p>```swift<br>// New<br>protocol P {<br>    type func foo()<br>}<br></p><p>struct S: P {<br>    type func foo() {}<br>}<br></p><p>class C: P {<br>    type func foo() {}<br>}<br>```<br></p><p>## Impact on existing code<br></p><p>With the help of a good migration tool, there will be no impact on<br>existing code at all. And the migration rules are very clear and<br>simple:<br></p><p>* Map `static` to `type` in protocols.<br>* Map `static` to `type` in structs and enums.<br>* Map `class` to `type` and `static` to `final type` in classes.<br></p><p>One concern I can think of is: because type methods are dynamically<br>dispatched by default in the new design, will we forget to do the<br>`final` optimization so the general performance of Swift code become<br>worse?<br></p><p>I think it is probably true. But we also forget to do the `final`<br>optimization for instance methods from time to time. Since there are<br>way more instance methods than type methods in most code the<br>performance impact will be very small. Maybe this change is a good<br>opportunity to remind us to do the `final` optimization for instance<br>methods thus even results in a better general performance.<br></p><p>And don’t forget we have the tools to automatically infer `final` for<br>us in many cases if we write the proper code and use the proper<br>compiler features.<br></p><p>After all, it is mainly on us to write good code to produce good final<br>products. If the system is consistent we’ll have better chances to<br>master it and use it properly.<br></p><p>## Alternatives considered<br></p><p>Alternatively we could:<br>* Keep using `static` and `class` keywords.<br>* Keep the confusion when implementing `static` protocol requirements<br>using `class` properties and methods in conforming classes.<br>* Keep the inconsistency between type member declarations and instance<br>member declarations.<br>* Keep overloading meanings on the `static` keyword that is already<br>historically overloaded in C and Objective-C with which Swift must mix<br>and match.<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8d9dbc0dfeb74eab8dd9bbd9cbd84680?s=50"></div><header><strong>Unify `static` and `class` keywords</strong> from <string>Jose Cheyo Jimenez</string> &lt;cheyo at masters3d.com&gt;<p>December  7, 2015 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>ChrisLattner wrote:<br></p><p><br></p><p>We considered unifying the syntax (e.g. using &quot;type&quot; as the keyword), but<br>that doesn&#39;t actually simply things.

In the current<br>&gt;&gt; implementation of Swift the differences between `class` and `static`<br>&gt;&gt; are:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 1. Class properties can only be calculated properties but not stored<br>&gt;&gt; properties.<br>&gt;&gt; 2. Class methods(also calculated properties) are dynamically<br>&gt;&gt; dispatched while static ones are statically dispatched.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; If we can eliminate the differences or find better ways to<br>&gt;&gt; differentiate we can use one unified keyword instead for declaring<br>&gt;&gt; type properties and methods.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Let’s see.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; #### Class stored properties VS. static stored properties<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; If you use the `class` keyword to declare a stored property in a class<br>&gt;&gt; you will get this compiling error:<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; class stored properties not yet supported in classes; did you mean<br>&gt;&gt; &#39;static&#39;?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; So what are class stored properties? How are they different from<br>&gt;&gt; static stored properties?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; As far as I know, class stored properties, if ever implemented in<br>&gt;&gt; Swift, “would be what Ruby calls ‘class instance<br>&gt;&gt; variables’”.&lt;sup&gt;[1](<br>&gt;&gt; https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/status/584104757117095936)&lt;/sup&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; So what are class instance variables?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The best explanation I can find is this<br>&gt;&gt; [one](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ClassInstanceVariable.html) from<br>&gt;&gt; Martin Fowler.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Do we really want this feature in Swift? “If we didn&#39;t already have<br>&gt;&gt; these, would we add them to Swift 3?&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I strongly believe we won’t add it to Swift 3. Actually I believe we<br>&gt;&gt; will never add it to Swift, because its use cases are so rare which is<br>&gt;&gt; also why it hasn’t been implemented so far in Swift.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; If we agree we are not going to support class stored properties, there<br>&gt;&gt; is and will be only one kind of stored properties for types and we<br>&gt;&gt; only need one keyword to declare such properties.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; #### Class methods VS. static methods<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; *Since calculated properties are also methods in essence they are also<br>&gt;&gt; covered by this section.*<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The only difference is how methods are dispatched.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Let’s see [how we handle it for instance<br>&gt;&gt; methods](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=27):<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; * Methods are overridable hence dynamically dispatched by default.<br>&gt;&gt; * In performance critical code use these techniques to restrict this<br>&gt;&gt; dynamic behavior when it isn’t needed to improve performance:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     1. Use the `final` keyword when we know that a declaration does<br>&gt;&gt; not need to be overridden.<br>&gt;&gt;     2. Infer `final` on declarations referenced in one file by<br>&gt;&gt; applying the `private` keyword.<br>&gt;&gt;     3. Use `Whole Module Optimization` to infer `final` on `internal`<br>&gt;&gt; declarations.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; So why abandon this whole system to use another totally different one<br>&gt;&gt; for differentiating `static dispatch` and `dynamic dispatch` for type<br>&gt;&gt; methods?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; If we reuse this system for type methods, not only can we have a<br>&gt;&gt; consistent design for both instance and type methods, but also we can<br>&gt;&gt; get rid of the last place where two keywords for type member<br>&gt;&gt; declarations are needed.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ## Proposed solution<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 1. Use the keyword `type` to declare type properties and methods.<br>&gt;&gt; 2. Type properties and methods are overridable hence dynamically<br>&gt;&gt; dispatched by default. Use the `final` keyword or inferred `final` to<br>&gt;&gt; make them final and statically dispatched, just like instance<br>&gt;&gt; properties and methods.<br>&gt;&gt; 3. Type properties can be stored or calculated, just like instance<br>&gt;&gt; properties.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; As you can see, it is a very simple and elegant design:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; * Just a single keyword `type` to differentiate type member<br>&gt;&gt; declarations from instance member declarations. `type` is a good<br>&gt;&gt; keyword because:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     1. It is consistent with the wording of the concepts of `type<br>&gt;&gt; properties` and `type methods`.<br>&gt;&gt;     2. It is never used as a keyword before in Swift, Objective-C or<br>&gt;&gt; C. There will be no conflicts or overloading of it meanings.<br>&gt;&gt; * Except for that, how things are declared, differentiated and<br>&gt;&gt; optimized are exactly the same in both type and instance world. Very<br>&gt;&gt; consistent.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ## Comparison with current design<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; * Dynamic Dispatch VS. Static Dispatch<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt; // Old<br>&gt;&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;     func dynamicInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;     final func staticInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     class func dynamicTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;     static func staticTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt; // New<br>&gt;&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;     func dynamicInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;     final func staticInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     type func dynamicTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;     final type func staticTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; * Stored Properties VS. Calculated Properties<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt; // Old<br>&gt;&gt; class Bar {<br>&gt;&gt;     static let i = 1<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     class var j: Int {<br>&gt;&gt;         return 1<br>&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt; // New<br>&gt;&gt; class Bar {<br>&gt;&gt;     type let i = 1<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     type var j: Int {<br>&gt;&gt;         return 1<br>&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; * Struct Implementation VS. Class Implementation of Protocol<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt; // Old<br>&gt;&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt;&gt;     static func foo()<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; struct S: P {<br>&gt;&gt;     static func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; class C: P {<br>&gt;&gt;     class func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt; // New<br>&gt;&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt;&gt;     type func foo()<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; struct S: P {<br>&gt;&gt;     type func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; class C: P {<br>&gt;&gt;     type func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ## Impact on existing code<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; With the help of a good migration tool, there will be no impact on<br>&gt;&gt; existing code at all. And the migration rules are very clear and<br>&gt;&gt; simple:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; * Map `static` to `type` in protocols.<br>&gt;&gt; * Map `static` to `type` in structs and enums.<br>&gt;&gt; * Map `class` to `type` and `static` to `final type` in classes.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; One concern I can think of is: because type methods are dynamically<br>&gt;&gt; dispatched by default in the new design, will we forget to do the<br>&gt;&gt; `final` optimization so the general performance of Swift code become<br>&gt;&gt; worse?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I think it is probably true. But we also forget to do the `final`<br>&gt;&gt; optimization for instance methods from time to time. Since there are<br>&gt;&gt; way more instance methods than type methods in most code the<br>&gt;&gt; performance impact will be very small. Maybe this change is a good<br>&gt;&gt; opportunity to remind us to do the `final` optimization for instance<br>&gt;&gt; methods thus even results in a better general performance.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; And don’t forget we have the tools to automatically infer `final` for<br>&gt;&gt; us in many cases if we write the proper code and use the proper<br>&gt;&gt; compiler features.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; After all, it is mainly on us to write good code to produce good final<br>&gt;&gt; products. If the system is consistent we’ll have better chances to<br>&gt;&gt; master it and use it properly.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ## Alternatives considered<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Alternatively we could:<br>&gt;&gt; * Keep using `static` and `class` keywords.<br>&gt;&gt; * Keep the confusion when implementing `static` protocol requirements<br>&gt;&gt; using `class` properties and methods in conforming classes.<br>&gt;&gt; * Keep the inconsistency between type member declarations and instance<br>&gt;&gt; member declarations.<br>&gt;&gt; * Keep overloading meanings on the `static` keyword that is already<br>&gt;&gt; historically overloaded in C and Objective-C with which Swift must mix<br>&gt;&gt; and match.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151207/b329dc0c/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8d9dbc0dfeb74eab8dd9bbd9cbd84680?s=50"></div><header><strong>Unify `static` and `class` keywords</strong> from <string>Jose Cheyo Jimenez</string> &lt;cheyo at masters3d.com&gt;<p>December  7, 2015 at 10:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Hi Ling,<br></p><p>In April 2015 you said on your blog that &quot;I was not convinced so I filed an<br>radar.&quot; It would seem to me that you are not convinced now either, even<br>after Chris explained that what you are asking for was<br>implemented, reverted and ultimately rejected.

You are now allowed to declare static stored<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; properties in classes, which have global storage and are lazily initialized<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; on first access (like global variables).

Maybe this change is a good<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; opportunity to remind us to do the `final` optimization for instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; methods thus even results in a better general performance.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; And don’t forget we have the tools to automatically infer `final` for<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; us in many cases if we write the proper code and use the proper<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; compiler features.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; After all, it is mainly on us to write good code to produce good final<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; products.

So please bear with me.<br>&gt; You can read on github for a better reading experience:<br>&gt; https://github.com/an0/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/NNNN-unify-static-and-class-keywords.md &lt;https://github.com/an0/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/NNNN-unify-static-and-class-keywords.md&gt;.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ## Introduction<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The coexistence of `static` and `class` keywords for declaring type<br>&gt; properties and methods is confusing and causes inconsistency between<br>&gt; type and instance member declarations. This document reasons why we<br>&gt; don’t need both and suggests we unify them with a better keyword<br>&gt; `type`.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ## Motivation<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ### Confusion<br>&gt; <br>&gt; One “language enhancement” of [Swift<br>&gt; 1.2](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/RN-Xcode/Chapters/xc6_release_notes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001051-CH4-SW6 &lt;https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/RN-Xcode/Chapters/xc6_release_notes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001051-CH4-SW6&gt;)<br>&gt; is:<br>&gt; &gt; “static” methods and properties are now allowed in classes (as an alias for class final). You are now allowed to declare static stored properties in classes, which have global storage and are lazily initialized on first access (like global variables). Protocols now declare type requirements as static requirements instead of declaring them as class requirements. (17198298)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If even the Swift team itself has difficulties in picking one from the<br>&gt; two and had to revert its initial decision after several revisions, we<br>&gt; know these keywords are indeed confusing.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; So now protocols use `static` to declare type methods, when a class<br>&gt; adapts such protocols, should it implement those static methods, as<br>&gt; static methods or class methods?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; But static means final, right? Does it mean we can not override these<br>&gt; methods in subclasses of the conforming class?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; These kinds of unnecessary confusion and hesitation should be<br>&gt; resolved, and could if this proposal is implemented.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ### Unnecessary and inconsistent differentiation<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The `class` keyword is only used in classes. In the current<br>&gt; implementation of Swift the differences between `class` and `static`<br>&gt; are:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1. Class properties can only be calculated properties but not stored properties.<br>&gt; 2. Class methods(also calculated properties) are dynamically<br>&gt; dispatched while static ones are statically dispatched.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If we can eliminate the differences or find better ways to<br>&gt; differentiate we can use one unified keyword instead for declaring<br>&gt; type properties and methods.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Let’s see.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; #### Class stored properties VS. static stored properties<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you use the `class` keyword to declare a stored property in a class<br>&gt; you will get this compiling error:<br>&gt; &gt; class stored properties not yet supported in classes; did you mean &#39;static&#39;?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; So what are class stored properties? How are they different from<br>&gt; static stored properties?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; As far as I know, class stored properties, if ever implemented in<br>&gt; Swift, “would be what Ruby calls ‘class instance<br>&gt; variables’”.&lt;sup&gt;[1](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/status/584104757117095936 &lt;https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/status/584104757117095936&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; So what are class instance variables?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The best explanation I can find is this<br>&gt; [one](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ClassInstanceVariable.html &lt;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ClassInstanceVariable.html&gt;) from<br>&gt; Martin Fowler.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Do we really want this feature in Swift? “If we didn&#39;t already have<br>&gt; these, would we add them to Swift 3?&quot;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I strongly believe we won’t add it to Swift 3. Actually I believe we<br>&gt; will never add it to Swift, because its use cases are so rare which is<br>&gt; also why it hasn’t been implemented so far in Swift.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If we agree we are not going to support class stored properties, there<br>&gt; is and will be only one kind of stored properties for types and we<br>&gt; only need one keyword to declare such properties.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; #### Class methods VS. static methods<br>&gt; <br>&gt; *Since calculated properties are also methods in essence they are also<br>&gt; covered by this section.*<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The only difference is how methods are dispatched.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Let’s see [how we handle it for instance<br>&gt; methods](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=27 &lt;https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=27&gt;):<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * Methods are overridable hence dynamically dispatched by default.<br>&gt; * In performance critical code use these techniques to restrict this<br>&gt; dynamic behavior when it isn’t needed to improve performance:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     1. Use the `final` keyword when we know that a declaration does<br>&gt; not need to be overridden.<br>&gt;     2. Infer `final` on declarations referenced in one file by<br>&gt; applying the `private` keyword.<br>&gt;     3. Use `Whole Module Optimization` to infer `final` on `internal`<br>&gt; declarations.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; So why abandon this whole system to use another totally different one<br>&gt; for differentiating `static dispatch` and `dynamic dispatch` for type<br>&gt; methods?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If we reuse this system for type methods, not only can we have a<br>&gt; consistent design for both instance and type methods, but also we can<br>&gt; get rid of the last place where two keywords for type member<br>&gt; declarations are needed.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ## Proposed solution<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1. Use the keyword `type` to declare type properties and methods.<br>&gt; 2. Type properties and methods are overridable hence dynamically<br>&gt; dispatched by default. Use the `final` keyword or inferred `final` to<br>&gt; make them final and statically dispatched, just like instance<br>&gt; properties and methods.<br>&gt; 3. Type properties can be stored or calculated, just like instance properties.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; As you can see, it is a very simple and elegant design:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * Just a single keyword `type` to differentiate type member<br>&gt; declarations from instance member declarations. `type` is a good<br>&gt; keyword because:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     1. It is consistent with the wording of the concepts of `type<br>&gt; properties` and `type methods`.<br>&gt;     2. It is never used as a keyword before in Swift, Objective-C or<br>&gt; C. There will be no conflicts or overloading of it meanings.<br>&gt; * Except for that, how things are declared, differentiated and<br>&gt; optimized are exactly the same in both type and instance world. Very<br>&gt; consistent.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ## Comparison with current design<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * Dynamic Dispatch VS. Static Dispatch<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ```swift<br>&gt; // Old<br>&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;     func dynamicInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;     final func staticInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     class func dynamicTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;     static func staticTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ```swift<br>&gt; // New<br>&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;     func dynamicInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;     final func staticInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     type func dynamicTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;     final type func staticTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * Stored Properties VS. Calculated Properties<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ```swift<br>&gt; // Old<br>&gt; class Bar {<br>&gt;     static let i = 1<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     class var j: Int {<br>&gt;         return 1<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ```swift<br>&gt; // New<br>&gt; class Bar {<br>&gt;     type let i = 1<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     type var j: Int {<br>&gt;         return 1<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * Struct Implementation VS. Class Implementation of Protocol<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ```swift<br>&gt; // Old<br>&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt;     static func foo()<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; struct S: P {<br>&gt;     static func foo() {}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C: P {<br>&gt;     class func foo() {}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ```swift<br>&gt; // New<br>&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt;     type func foo()<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; struct S: P {<br>&gt;     type func foo() {}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class C: P {<br>&gt;     type func foo() {}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ## Impact on existing code<br>&gt; <br>&gt; With the help of a good migration tool, there will be no impact on<br>&gt; existing code at all.

You are now allowed to declare static stored properties in classes, which have global storage and are lazily initialized on first access (like global variables). Protocols now declare type requirements as static requirements instead of declaring them as class requirements. (17198298)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; If even the Swift team itself has difficulties in picking one from the<br>&gt;&gt; two and had to revert its initial decision after several revisions, we<br>&gt;&gt; know these keywords are indeed confusing.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; So now protocols use `static` to declare type methods, when a class<br>&gt;&gt; adapts such protocols, should it implement those static methods, as<br>&gt;&gt; static methods or class methods?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; But static means final, right? Does it mean we can not override these<br>&gt;&gt; methods in subclasses of the conforming class?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; These kinds of unnecessary confusion and hesitation should be<br>&gt;&gt; resolved, and could if this proposal is implemented.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; ### Unnecessary and inconsistent differentiation<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The `class` keyword is only used in classes. In the current<br>&gt;&gt; implementation of Swift the differences between `class` and `static`<br>&gt;&gt; are:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 1. Class properties can only be calculated properties but not stored properties.<br>&gt;&gt; 2. Class methods(also calculated properties) are dynamically<br>&gt;&gt; dispatched while static ones are statically dispatched.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; If we can eliminate the differences or find better ways to<br>&gt;&gt; differentiate we can use one unified keyword instead for declaring<br>&gt;&gt; type properties and methods.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Let’s see.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; #### Class stored properties VS. static stored properties<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; If you use the `class` keyword to declare a stored property in a class<br>&gt;&gt; you will get this compiling error:<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; class stored properties not yet supported in classes; did you mean &#39;static&#39;?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; So what are class stored properties? How are they different from<br>&gt;&gt; static stored properties?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; As far as I know, class stored properties, if ever implemented in<br>&gt;&gt; Swift, “would be what Ruby calls ‘class instance<br>&gt;&gt; variables’”.&lt;sup&gt;[1](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/status/584104757117095936 &lt;https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/status/584104757117095936&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; So what are class instance variables?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The best explanation I can find is this<br>&gt;&gt; [one](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ClassInstanceVariable.html &lt;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ClassInstanceVariable.html&gt;) from<br>&gt;&gt; Martin Fowler.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Do we really want this feature in Swift? “If we didn&#39;t already have<br>&gt;&gt; these, would we add them to Swift 3?&quot;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I strongly believe we won’t add it to Swift 3. Actually I believe we<br>&gt;&gt; will never add it to Swift, because its use cases are so rare which is<br>&gt;&gt; also why it hasn’t been implemented so far in Swift.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; If we agree we are not going to support class stored properties, there<br>&gt;&gt; is and will be only one kind of stored properties for types and we<br>&gt;&gt; only need one keyword to declare such properties.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; #### Class methods VS. static methods<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; *Since calculated properties are also methods in essence they are also<br>&gt;&gt; covered by this section.*<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The only difference is how methods are dispatched.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Let’s see [how we handle it for instance<br>&gt;&gt; methods](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=27 &lt;https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=27&gt;):<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; * Methods are overridable hence dynamically dispatched by default.<br>&gt;&gt; * In performance critical code use these techniques to restrict this<br>&gt;&gt; dynamic behavior when it isn’t needed to improve performance:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;     1. Use the `final` keyword when we know that a declaration does<br>&gt;&gt; not need to be overridden.<br>&gt;&gt;     2. Infer `final` on declarations referenced in one file by<br>&gt;&gt; applying the `private` keyword.<br>&gt;&gt;     3. Use `Whole Module Optimization` to infer `final` on `internal`<br>&gt;&gt; declarations.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; So why abandon this whole system to use another totally different one<br>&gt;&gt; for differentiating `static dispatch` and `dynamic dispatch` for type<br>&gt;&gt; methods?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; If we reuse this system for type methods, not only can we have a<br>&gt;&gt; consistent design for both instance and type methods, but also we can<br>&gt;&gt; get rid of the last place where two keywords for type member<br>&gt;&gt; declarations are needed.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; ## Proposed solution<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 1. Use the keyword `type` to declare type properties and methods.<br>&gt;&gt; 2. Type properties and methods are overridable hence dynamically<br>&gt;&gt; dispatched by default. Use the `final` keyword or inferred `final` to<br>&gt;&gt; make them final and statically dispatched, just like instance<br>&gt;&gt; properties and methods.<br>&gt;&gt; 3. Type properties can be stored or calculated, just like instance properties.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; As you can see, it is a very simple and elegant design:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; * Just a single keyword `type` to differentiate type member<br>&gt;&gt; declarations from instance member declarations. `type` is a good<br>&gt;&gt; keyword because:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;     1. It is consistent with the wording of the concepts of `type<br>&gt;&gt; properties` and `type methods`.<br>&gt;&gt;     2. It is never used as a keyword before in Swift, Objective-C or<br>&gt;&gt; C. There will be no conflicts or overloading of it meanings.<br>&gt;&gt; * Except for that, how things are declared, differentiated and<br>&gt;&gt; optimized are exactly the same in both type and instance world. Very<br>&gt;&gt; consistent.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; ## Comparison with current design<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; * Dynamic Dispatch VS. Static Dispatch<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt; // Old<br>&gt;&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;     func dynamicInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;     final func staticInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;     class func dynamicTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;     static func staticTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt; // New<br>&gt;&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;     func dynamicInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;     final func staticInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;     type func dynamicTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;     final type func staticTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; * Stored Properties VS. Calculated Properties<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt; // Old<br>&gt;&gt; class Bar {<br>&gt;&gt;     static let i = 1<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;     class var j: Int {<br>&gt;&gt;         return 1<br>&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt; // New<br>&gt;&gt; class Bar {<br>&gt;&gt;     type let i = 1<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;     type var j: Int {<br>&gt;&gt;         return 1<br>&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; * Struct Implementation VS. Class Implementation of Protocol<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt; // Old<br>&gt;&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt;&gt;     static func foo()<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; struct S: P {<br>&gt;&gt;     static func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; class C: P {<br>&gt;&gt;     class func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt; // New<br>&gt;&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt;&gt;     type func foo()<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; struct S: P {<br>&gt;&gt;     type func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; class C: P {<br>&gt;&gt;     type func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; ## Impact on existing code<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; With the help of a good migration tool, there will be no impact on<br>&gt;&gt; existing code at all. And the migration rules are very clear and<br>&gt;&gt; simple:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; * Map `static` to `type` in protocols.<br>&gt;&gt; * Map `static` to `type` in structs and enums.<br>&gt;&gt; * Map `class` to `type` and `static` to `final type` in classes.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; One concern I can think of is: because type methods are dynamically<br>&gt;&gt; dispatched by default in the new design, will we forget to do the<br>&gt;&gt; `final` optimization so the general performance of Swift code become<br>&gt;&gt; worse?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I think it is probably true. But we also forget to do the `final`<br>&gt;&gt; optimization for instance methods from time to time. Since there are<br>&gt;&gt; way more instance methods than type methods in most code the<br>&gt;&gt; performance impact will be very small. Maybe this change is a good<br>&gt;&gt; opportunity to remind us to do the `final` optimization for instance<br>&gt;&gt; methods thus even results in a better general performance.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; And don’t forget we have the tools to automatically infer `final` for<br>&gt;&gt; us in many cases if we write the proper code and use the proper<br>&gt;&gt; compiler features.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; After all, it is mainly on us to write good code to produce good final<br>&gt;&gt; products. If the system is consistent we’ll have better chances to<br>&gt;&gt; master it and use it properly.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; ## Alternatives considered<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Alternatively we could:<br>&gt;&gt; * Keep using `static` and `class` keywords.<br>&gt;&gt; * Keep the confusion when implementing `static` protocol requirements<br>&gt;&gt; using `class` properties and methods in conforming classes.<br>&gt;&gt; * Keep the inconsistency between type member declarations and instance<br>&gt;&gt; member declarations.<br>&gt;&gt; * Keep overloading meanings on the `static` keyword that is already<br>&gt;&gt; historically overloaded in C and Objective-C with which Swift must mix<br>&gt;&gt; and match.<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151208/809be885/attachment-0001.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d5c03d71ebd1813a9c856bff896009b7?s=50"></div><header><strong>Unify `static` and `class` keywords</strong> from <string>Daniel Valls Estella</string> &lt;daniel at upzzle.com&gt;<p>December  8, 2015 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; `overridable` is unnecessary since we already have `final`.<br></p><p><br>Agree in part, but it’s to keep the current behaviour of being final by default, without anotating it, that maybe is a better aproach for shared properties.<br></p><p>&gt; El 8 des 2015, a les 16:51, Ling Wang &lt;an00na at gmail.com&gt; va escriure:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Yes, the `static` is badly overloaded with many different meanings:<br>&gt; 1. static storage (old, from C)<br>&gt; 2. static linking (old, from C)<br>&gt; 3. final (new in Swift)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That’s why I’m proposing we use a new keyword.

In the current<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; implementation of Swift the differences between `class` and `static`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; are:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Class properties can only be calculated properties but not stored properties.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Class methods(also calculated properties) are dynamically<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; dispatched while static ones are statically dispatched.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If we can eliminate the differences or find better ways to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; differentiate we can use one unified keyword instead for declaring<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; type properties and methods.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Let’s see.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; #### Class stored properties VS. static stored properties<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If you use the `class` keyword to declare a stored property in a class<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; you will get this compiling error:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; class stored properties not yet supported in classes; did you mean &#39;static&#39;?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; So what are class stored properties? How are they different from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; static stored properties?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as I know, class stored properties, if ever implemented in<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift, “would be what Ruby calls ‘class instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; variables’”.&lt;sup&gt;[1](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/status/584104757117095936 &lt;https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/status/584104757117095936&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; So what are class instance variables?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The best explanation I can find is this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; [one](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ClassInstanceVariable.html &lt;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ClassInstanceVariable.html&gt;) from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Martin Fowler.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Do we really want this feature in Swift? “If we didn&#39;t already have<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; these, would we add them to Swift 3?&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I strongly believe we won’t add it to Swift 3. Actually I believe we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; will never add it to Swift, because its use cases are so rare which is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; also why it hasn’t been implemented so far in Swift.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If we agree we are not going to support class stored properties, there<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; is and will be only one kind of stored properties for types and we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; only need one keyword to declare such properties.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; #### Class methods VS. static methods<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; *Since calculated properties are also methods in essence they are also<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; covered by this section.*<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The only difference is how methods are dispatched.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Let’s see [how we handle it for instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; methods](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=27 &lt;https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=27&gt;):<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Methods are overridable hence dynamically dispatched by default.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * In performance critical code use these techniques to restrict this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; dynamic behavior when it isn’t needed to improve performance:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     1. Use the `final` keyword when we know that a declaration does<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; not need to be overridden.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     2. Infer `final` on declarations referenced in one file by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; applying the `private` keyword.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     3. Use `Whole Module Optimization` to infer `final` on `internal`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; declarations.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; So why abandon this whole system to use another totally different one<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; for differentiating `static dispatch` and `dynamic dispatch` for type<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; methods?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If we reuse this system for type methods, not only can we have a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; consistent design for both instance and type methods, but also we can<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; get rid of the last place where two keywords for type member<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; declarations are needed.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ## Proposed solution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Use the keyword `type` to declare type properties and methods.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Type properties and methods are overridable hence dynamically<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; dispatched by default. Use the `final` keyword or inferred `final` to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; make them final and statically dispatched, just like instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; properties and methods.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Type properties can be stored or calculated, just like instance properties.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; As you can see, it is a very simple and elegant design:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Just a single keyword `type` to differentiate type member<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; declarations from instance member declarations. `type` is a good<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; keyword because:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     1. It is consistent with the wording of the concepts of `type<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; properties` and `type methods`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     2. It is never used as a keyword before in Swift, Objective-C or<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; C. There will be no conflicts or overloading of it meanings.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Except for that, how things are declared, differentiated and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; optimized are exactly the same in both type and instance world. Very<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; consistent.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ## Comparison with current design<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Dynamic Dispatch VS. Static Dispatch<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; // Old<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     func dynamicInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     final func staticInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     class func dynamicTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     static func staticTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; // New<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     func dynamicInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     final func staticInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     type func dynamicTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     final type func staticTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Stored Properties VS. Calculated Properties<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; // Old<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bar {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     static let i = 1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     class var j: Int {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         return 1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; // New<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bar {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     type let i = 1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     type var j: Int {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         return 1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Struct Implementation VS. Class Implementation of Protocol<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; // Old<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     static func foo()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; struct S: P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     static func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C: P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     class func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; // New<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     type func foo()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; struct S: P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     type func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C: P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     type func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ## Impact on existing code<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; With the help of a good migration tool, there will be no impact on<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; existing code at all. And the migration rules are very clear and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; simple:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Map `static` to `type` in protocols.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Map `static` to `type` in structs and enums.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Map `class` to `type` and `static` to `final type` in classes.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; One concern I can think of is: because type methods are dynamically<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; dispatched by default in the new design, will we forget to do the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; `final` optimization so the general performance of Swift code become<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; worse?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I think it is probably true. But we also forget to do the `final`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; optimization for instance methods from time to time. Since there are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; way more instance methods than type methods in most code the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; performance impact will be very small. Maybe this change is a good<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; opportunity to remind us to do the `final` optimization for instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; methods thus even results in a better general performance.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; And don’t forget we have the tools to automatically infer `final` for<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; us in many cases if we write the proper code and use the proper<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; compiler features.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; After all, it is mainly on us to write good code to produce good final<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; products. If the system is consistent we’ll have better chances to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; master it and use it properly.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ## Alternatives considered<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Alternatively we could:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Keep using `static` and `class` keywords.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Keep the confusion when implementing `static` protocol requirements<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; using `class` properties and methods in conforming classes.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Keep the inconsistency between type member declarations and instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; member declarations.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * Keep overloading meanings on the `static` keyword that is already<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; historically overloaded in C and Objective-C with which Swift must mix<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; and match.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt; <br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151208/820cf028/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a726de03bed3104ddaecca3fdcf59e19?s=50"></div><header><strong>Unify `static` and `class` keywords</strong> from <string>Ling Wang</string> &lt;an00na at gmail.com&gt;<p>December  8, 2015 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>I understand the intention to keep total compatibility with existing code.

You are now allowed to declare static stored properties in classes, which have global storage and are lazily initialized on first access (like global variables).

How are they different from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; static stored properties?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as I know, class stored properties, if ever implemented in<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift, “would be what Ruby calls ‘class instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; variables’”.&lt;sup&gt;[1](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/status/584104757117095936 &lt;https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/status/584104757117095936&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So what are class instance variables?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The best explanation I can find is this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [one](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ClassInstanceVariable.html &lt;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ClassInstanceVariable.html&gt;) from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Martin Fowler.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do we really want this feature in Swift? “If we didn&#39;t already have<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these, would we add them to Swift 3?&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I strongly believe we won’t add it to Swift 3. Actually I believe we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will never add it to Swift, because its use cases are so rare which is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also why it hasn’t been implemented so far in Swift.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If we agree we are not going to support class stored properties, there<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is and will be only one kind of stored properties for types and we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only need one keyword to declare such properties.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #### Class methods VS. static methods<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *Since calculated properties are also methods in essence they are also<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; covered by this section.*<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The only difference is how methods are dispatched.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let’s see [how we handle it for instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; methods](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=27 &lt;https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=27&gt;):<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Methods are overridable hence dynamically dispatched by default.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * In performance critical code use these techniques to restrict this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dynamic behavior when it isn’t needed to improve performance:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     1. Use the `final` keyword when we know that a declaration does<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not need to be overridden.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     2. Infer `final` on declarations referenced in one file by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; applying the `private` keyword.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     3. Use `Whole Module Optimization` to infer `final` on `internal`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; declarations.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So why abandon this whole system to use another totally different one<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for differentiating `static dispatch` and `dynamic dispatch` for type<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; methods?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If we reuse this system for type methods, not only can we have a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consistent design for both instance and type methods, but also we can<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get rid of the last place where two keywords for type member<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; declarations are needed.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ## Proposed solution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Use the keyword `type` to declare type properties and methods.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Type properties and methods are overridable hence dynamically<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dispatched by default. Use the `final` keyword or inferred `final` to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make them final and statically dispatched, just like instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; properties and methods.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Type properties can be stored or calculated, just like instance properties.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As you can see, it is a very simple and elegant design:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Just a single keyword `type` to differentiate type member<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; declarations from instance member declarations. `type` is a good<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keyword because:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     1. It is consistent with the wording of the concepts of `type<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; properties` and `type methods`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     2. It is never used as a keyword before in Swift, Objective-C or<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; C. There will be no conflicts or overloading of it meanings.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Except for that, how things are declared, differentiated and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; optimized are exactly the same in both type and instance world. Very<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consistent.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ## Comparison with current design<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Dynamic Dispatch VS. Static Dispatch<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // Old<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func dynamicInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     final func staticInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     class func dynamicTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     static func staticTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // New<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func dynamicInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     final func staticInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     type func dynamicTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     final type func staticTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Stored Properties VS. Calculated Properties<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // Old<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bar {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     static let i = 1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     class var j: Int {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         return 1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // New<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bar {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     type let i = 1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     type var j: Int {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         return 1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Struct Implementation VS. Class Implementation of Protocol<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // Old<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     static func foo()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; struct S: P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     static func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class C: P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     class func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // New<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     type func foo()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; struct S: P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     type func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class C: P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     type func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ## Impact on existing code<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With the help of a good migration tool, there will be no impact on<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; existing code at all. And the migration rules are very clear and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simple:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Map `static` to `type` in protocols.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Map `static` to `type` in structs and enums.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Map `class` to `type` and `static` to `final type` in classes.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One concern I can think of is: because type methods are dynamically<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dispatched by default in the new design, will we forget to do the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `final` optimization so the general performance of Swift code become<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; worse?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think it is probably true. But we also forget to do the `final`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; optimization for instance methods from time to time. Since there are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; way more instance methods than type methods in most code the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; performance impact will be very small. Maybe this change is a good<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opportunity to remind us to do the `final` optimization for instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; methods thus even results in a better general performance.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And don’t forget we have the tools to automatically infer `final` for<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; us in many cases if we write the proper code and use the proper<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compiler features.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After all, it is mainly on us to write good code to produce good final<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; products. If the system is consistent we’ll have better chances to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; master it and use it properly.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ## Alternatives considered<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Alternatively we could:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Keep using `static` and `class` keywords.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Keep the confusion when implementing `static` protocol requirements<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using `class` properties and methods in conforming classes.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Keep the inconsistency between type member declarations and instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; member declarations.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Keep overloading meanings on the `static` keyword that is already<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; historically overloaded in C and Objective-C with which Swift must mix<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and match.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt; <br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151208/c673f772/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>Unify `static` and `class` keywords</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>December  8, 2015 at 09:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Dec 8, 2015, at 7:51 AM, Ling Wang via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Yes, the `static` is badly overloaded with many different meanings:<br>&gt; 1. static storage (old, from C)<br>&gt; 2. static linking (old, from C)<br>&gt; 3. final (new in Swift)<br></p><p>static means something like 9 different things in C, including the little known C99 static array parameter size use.

You are now allowed to declare static stored<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; properties in classes, which have global storage and are lazily initialized<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on first access (like global variables). Protocols now declare type<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; requirements as static requirements instead of declaring them as class<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; requirements. (17198298)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If even the Swift team itself has difficulties in picking one from the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; two and had to revert its initial decision after several revisions, we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know these keywords are indeed confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So now protocols use `static` to declare type methods, when a class<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adapts such protocols, should it implement those static methods, as<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; static methods or class methods?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But static means final, right? Does it mean we can not override these<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; methods in subclasses of the conforming class?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These kinds of unnecessary confusion and hesitation should be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resolved, and could if this proposal is implemented.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ### Unnecessary and inconsistent differentiation<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The `class` keyword is only used in classes. In the current<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; implementation of Swift the differences between `class` and `static`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Class properties can only be calculated properties but not stored<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; properties.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Class methods(also calculated properties) are dynamically<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dispatched while static ones are statically dispatched.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If we can eliminate the differences or find better ways to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; differentiate we can use one unified keyword instead for declaring<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type properties and methods.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let’s see.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #### Class stored properties VS. static stored properties<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you use the `class` keyword to declare a stored property in a class<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you will get this compiling error:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; class stored properties not yet supported in classes; did you mean<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;static&#39;?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So what are class stored properties? How are they different from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; static stored properties?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as I know, class stored properties, if ever implemented in<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift, “would be what Ruby calls ‘class instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; variables’”.&lt;sup&gt;[1](<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/status/584104757117095936)&lt;/sup&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So what are class instance variables?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The best explanation I can find is this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [one](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ClassInstanceVariable.html) from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Martin Fowler.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do we really want this feature in Swift? “If we didn&#39;t already have<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these, would we add them to Swift 3?&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I strongly believe we won’t add it to Swift 3. Actually I believe we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will never add it to Swift, because its use cases are so rare which is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also why it hasn’t been implemented so far in Swift.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If we agree we are not going to support class stored properties, there<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is and will be only one kind of stored properties for types and we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only need one keyword to declare such properties.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #### Class methods VS. static methods<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *Since calculated properties are also methods in essence they are also<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; covered by this section.*<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The only difference is how methods are dispatched.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let’s see [how we handle it for instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; methods](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=27):<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Methods are overridable hence dynamically dispatched by default.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * In performance critical code use these techniques to restrict this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dynamic behavior when it isn’t needed to improve performance:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     1. Use the `final` keyword when we know that a declaration does<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not need to be overridden.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     2. Infer `final` on declarations referenced in one file by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; applying the `private` keyword.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     3. Use `Whole Module Optimization` to infer `final` on `internal`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; declarations.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So why abandon this whole system to use another totally different one<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for differentiating `static dispatch` and `dynamic dispatch` for type<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; methods?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If we reuse this system for type methods, not only can we have a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consistent design for both instance and type methods, but also we can<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get rid of the last place where two keywords for type member<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; declarations are needed.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ## Proposed solution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Use the keyword `type` to declare type properties and methods.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Type properties and methods are overridable hence dynamically<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dispatched by default. Use the `final` keyword or inferred `final` to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make them final and statically dispatched, just like instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; properties and methods.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Type properties can be stored or calculated, just like instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; properties.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As you can see, it is a very simple and elegant design:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Just a single keyword `type` to differentiate type member<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; declarations from instance member declarations. `type` is a good<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keyword because:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     1. It is consistent with the wording of the concepts of `type<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; properties` and `type methods`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     2. It is never used as a keyword before in Swift, Objective-C or<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; C. There will be no conflicts or overloading of it meanings.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Except for that, how things are declared, differentiated and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; optimized are exactly the same in both type and instance world. Very<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consistent.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ## Comparison with current design<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Dynamic Dispatch VS. Static Dispatch<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // Old<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func dynamicInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     final func staticInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     class func dynamicTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     static func staticTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // New<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func dynamicInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     final func staticInstanceMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     type func dynamicTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     final type func staticTypeMethod() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Stored Properties VS. Calculated Properties<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // Old<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bar {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     static let i = 1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     class var j: Int {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         return 1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // New<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bar {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     type let i = 1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     type var j: Int {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         return 1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Struct Implementation VS. Class Implementation of Protocol<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // Old<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     static func foo()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; struct S: P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     static func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class C: P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     class func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // New<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     type func foo()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; struct S: P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     type func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class C: P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     type func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ## Impact on existing code<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With the help of a good migration tool, there will be no impact on<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; existing code at all. And the migration rules are very clear and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simple:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Map `static` to `type` in protocols.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Map `static` to `type` in structs and enums.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Map `class` to `type` and `static` to `final type` in classes.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One concern I can think of is: because type methods are dynamically<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dispatched by default in the new design, will we forget to do the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `final` optimization so the general performance of Swift code become<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; worse?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think it is probably true. But we also forget to do the `final`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; optimization for instance methods from time to time. Since there are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; way more instance methods than type methods in most code the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; performance impact will be very small. Maybe this change is a good<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opportunity to remind us to do the `final` optimization for instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; methods thus even results in a better general performance.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And don’t forget we have the tools to automatically infer `final` for<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; us in many cases if we write the proper code and use the proper<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compiler features.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; After all, it is mainly on us to write good code to produce good final<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; products. If the system is consistent we’ll have better chances to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; master it and use it properly.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ## Alternatives considered<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Alternatively we could:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Keep using `static` and `class` keywords.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Keep the confusion when implementing `static` protocol requirements<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using `class` properties and methods in conforming classes.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Keep the inconsistency between type member declarations and instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; member declarations.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * Keep overloading meanings on the `static` keyword that is already<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; historically overloaded in C and Objective-C with which Swift must mix<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and match.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151208/2278da8c/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>Unify `static` and `class` keywords</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>December  7, 2015 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Dec 7, 2015, at 8:13 AM, an0 via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; The coexistence of `static` and `class` keywords for declaring type<br>&gt; properties and methods is confusing and causes inconsistency between<br>&gt; type and instance member declarations.

But you misunderstood my proposal. I&#39;ll restate my points about “type properties”:<br></p><p>1. Stored class properties(let’s call them “class instance variables” for better discussion about “stored type properties” below) are not very useful or needed. So we are not likely to add them to Swift. This one we both agree. So there is only one kind of stored properties for types and they are stored like global variables, which are now called “static stored properties“. <br></p><p>2. `type` properties in my proposal covers both stored properties and calculated properties. Except for the `type` keyword, the way they are declared are exactly the same as that of instance properties:<br>```<br>class Foo {<br>    type let i = 1 // stored type property<br>    type var k: Int { // calculated type property<br>        return 1<br>    }<br>} <br>```<br></p><p>3. Since we’ve already excluded “class instance variables” in point 1, stored type properies in my proposal are certainly not “class instance variables”. They behave the same as the current “static stored properties”. This is where you misunderstood me. <br></p><p>So you don’t need the `final` keyword to make them “static”. If they are “stored”(VS calculated) they are “static”. We just don’t use `static` as the keyword.<br></p><p>Static storage is the implementation details. Just like global variable declarations don’t need `static` keyword though they use static storage, stored type property declarations don’t need `static` keyword to denote they use static storage. After all there is only one kind of stored type properties.<br></p><p>As you said most people expect type properties to be “static”, together with the fact that most people don’t know about “class instance variables”, stored type properties being “static” is simply the commonly accepted default behavior.<br></p><p>As to those who know about “class instance variables” we need to explain to them that stored type properties are not “class instance variables”.

In fact, instead of “static var x” you’d have to write “final type var x”, which would be an unfortunate regression.<br>&gt;&gt; When you said &quot;You list many complaints about class properties” you meant “class stored properties”, right?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; If so I don’t think I’ve ever complained about it because Swift doesn’t support class stored properties yet. My points about class stored properties are:<br>&gt;&gt; 1. Are they useful enough? Do we want it in Swift?<br>&gt;&gt; 2. Are we going to add it in Swift? If yes, when?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Perhaps, but they are very low priority. <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 3. If no, then we only have one kind of type stored properties, why do we need two keywords for them?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; You’re missing what I’m trying to say.  With your design:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;   type var x : Int<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This would be a stored class property, which isn’t supported and won’t be for the forseeable.  This would require people to write:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;   final type var x : Int<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This is a lot worse than:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; class Foo {<br>&gt;   static var x : Int<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ... both in terms of boilerplate noise, but also in that it leads them down the wrong path.  Many people would write “type var x : Int” wanting a static member, because they don’t understand how class variables work.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Your approach would make class members *more* prominent, not less.  We’ve tried this, this is not a theoretical concern.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Chris<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151207/073c8e94/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4fe988326eed161b989d0c5521cb105?s=50"></div><header><strong>Unify `static` and `class` keywords</strong> from <string>Jordan Rose</string> &lt;jordan_rose at apple.com&gt;<p>December  8, 2015 at 03:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Dec 7, 2015, at 19:12, Ling Wang via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Besides, we shouldn’t use `final` to denote storage at all for `final` is about inheritability/overridability not about storage.<br>&gt; <br></p><p>Please remember that stored properties can be overridden in Swift:<br></p><p>class Base {<br>  /*instance*/ var flag: Bool = true<br>}<br></p><p>class Sub : Base {<br>  override var flag: Bool {<br>    didSet {<br>      if flag { print(&quot;The flag was set!&quot;) }<br>    }<br>  }<br>}<br></p><p>This is theoretically possible at the class level as well, but doesn&#39;t really make sense for what&#39;s currently spelled &quot;static var&quot;, since you&#39;d be accessing the same storage in different ways.

To put it another way, if the base class&#39;s computed implementation stored values in a dictionary keyed by &#39;self&#39;, it would effectively be an implementation of true class properties.

But after the call of super setter, the value of this property accessed via subclasses(suppose them don’t overload get/set) does change. It means their properties are changed without their knowing it even though they explicitly define observers to observe the changes.                                                    <br>                                                                       ```                                                       var backingVarForFooI = 0                   <br>                   <br>class Foo {                   <br>    class var i: Int {                   <br>        get {                   <br>            return backingVarForFooI                   <br>        }                   <br>                           <br>        set {                   <br>            backingVarForFooI = newValue                   <br>            print(&quot;Foo.i.set \(newValue)&quot;)                   <br>        }                   <br>    }                   <br>}                   <br>                   <br>class Bar: Foo {                   <br>    override class var i: Int {                   <br>        didSet {                   <br>            print(&quot;Bar.i.didSet \(i)&quot;)                   <br>        }                   <br>    }                   <br>}                   <br>                   <br>print(Bar.i)                   <br>Foo.i = 3                   <br>print(Bar.i)                                                       ```                                                                      <br>                                                    If we think about it, it doesn’t matter whether the proper is stored or calculated. Storage is just the implementation details, it doesn’t affect the interface or the concept. Besides, even calculated properties need storage if they are mutable.                                                    <br>                                                    After super class changes a property, people expect to get the changed value when they access the property via their subclasses(suppose they don’t overload get/set) and expect the corresponding observers to get called. So the class object modal that I speculated sharing properties among all subclasses and super class and notifying them about property changes is the only sound modal in this aspect. So the concern about overloading stored type properties with observers is not only about stored type properties but about all type properties.                                                    <br>                                                    So there is nothing special to separate stored type properties from calculated type properties. It supports my proposal to unite them under a more general keyword.                                                    <br>                                                    - Ling                                                    <br>                                                                                           On Dec 9, 2015, at 10:23 AM, Ling Wang &lt;                    an00na at gmail.com&gt; wrote:                                      <br>                                                                                                      This is a legit concern that I didn’t consider before.                                                                <br>                                                                I think there are several options, from the most general to the most subtle:                                                                1. Stored type properties are implicit `final`, so behave exactly the same as the current static stored properties.                                                                2. Stored type vars are implicit `final`, as you suggested, so behave exactly the same as the current static stored vars. All other type properties(including stored type lets) are normally overridable.                                                                3. Store type vars are overridable but can not be observed.                                                                 <br>                                                                There could be a even more subtle option if my understanding of how classes exist in runtime is correct.                                                                <br>                                                                In my understanding, classes exist as singleton instances of their meta classes. If it is true, which I believe is the image in most people’s heads if they know about meta classes, then the class objects tree is exactly the same as the class hierarchy tree. Every subclass object contains(or points to) its super class object in its layout. The super class part is shared by all subclass objects and the super class object per se. So stored type properties are conceptually and naturally shared by the super class and all its subclasses, which behave exactly like the current static stored properties.                                                                <br>                                                                In this modal, the 4th option is:                                                                4. Stored type vars are overridable and observable. When they are assigned new values, all their property observers defined in the class hierarchy are called, calling order is not significant, the reason of which will be addressed later.                                                                <br>                                                                Unfortunately, there is one last catch: if more than one classes assign a value to the property within their didSet observer, the final result is undefined.                                                                <br>                                                                This issue can not even be resolved by ordering observer calls from top to bottom in the class hierarchy because we can not meaningfully define the order within the same level if there are more than one subclasses in it.                                                                <br>                                                                So one addition to option 4:                                                                4-1. Stored type vars’ didSet observers are not allowed to reassign value to the observed property.                                                                <br>                                                                But it is such a corner case that probably this limitation is acceptable.                                                                <br>                                                                What do you think?
