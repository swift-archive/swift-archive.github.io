What I said there was that it will require a lot of very careful language/type-checker design work.  Here, I’d like to identity another problem: the behavior of implicit conversions can be very confusing for non-experts to reason about, and in the context of a language with a fair amount of other subtle behaviors (e.g. due to overloading), that’s a very dangerous thing to bring in.

That surprises me.<br></p><p>It shouldn’t.  I am not aware of any languages in which = (or its equivalent) is just a normal overloaded operator.  Even in C++, (1) there are different formation rules for assignment operators, (2) assignment operators are often implicitly generated, (3) explicitly declared assignment operators can have subtle effects on formal language behavior, and (4) the resolution rules for assignment are different from the rules for other user-defined operators, even compound assignment.<br></p><p>Oh, and of course (5) the token “=&quot; doesn’t mean assignment in the contexts where it actually means initialization, which is something that was actually confused earlier in this thread, and which is probably the single most common point of confusion among even quite knowledgeable C++ programmers — and which is, by and large, a problem that we’ve defined away in Swift by not introducing this kind of semantic confusion around the behavior of =.<br></p><p>&gt; And it fails one of the basic principles that I&#39;ve always applied to software design:  The Principle of Least Astonishment.<br></p><p>In fact, in my experience, programmers tend to be quite astonished by the behavior of overloaded assignment.<br></p><p>Again, the feature you actually need for all of your examples is literal convertibility, which already exists; please look into it before writing off the language.<br></p><p>John.<br></p><p>&gt; Thanks for your response, even though it is quite disheartening to me.
