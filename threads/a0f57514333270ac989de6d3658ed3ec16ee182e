In my team we write “final class” a lot. We also do have a lot of internal frameworks and an ability to guide external frameworks uses is important for us. We have a lot of candidates in our frameworks that should be inheritable internally, but we do not recommend to extend them outside of framework.<br></p><p>My biggest worry with this proposal is already highlighted in a section &quot;Modifier spelling alternatives”. Proposal introduces a set of new keywords to express relatively similar concept as current `final` keyword. We currently have already an ability to limit inheritance by use `final`, but we can not define a scope. However we also have keywords to define an accessibility scope:<br>* public — accessible everywhere<br>* internal — accessible within a module<br>* private — accessible within a file<br></p><p>For example, by leveraging existing keywords we can write code like following:<br>final(internal) class Foo {<br>  final(private) func bar() {<br>  }<br>} <br>So the class `Foo` is inheritable within a module, but method bar is overridable only within same file. <br>There is also optional `final(public)` that literally means no limitations on inheritance that can be used to indicate that class or method is `final(public)` on purpose by design. We use the similar approach in our code base with `internal`, while it is default keyword for classes and functions we still write it to show that it is internal by design and no public / private keyword missing.<br></p><p>Also with suggestion above we can default `final` to `final(private)`to keep backwards compatibility. <br></p><p>Best,<br>Nikita Leonov<br></p><p>&gt; On Jul 5, 2016, at 4:11 PM, Chris Lattner &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The review of &quot;SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly&quot; begins now and runs through July 11.

To turn the tables a bit, one could argue<br>that, taken to the proposal&#39;s logical conclusion, writable properties<br>should not be publicly writable for safety&#39;s sake. Instead, they should<br>be required to be explicitly marked as publicly settable if needed as it<br>should be up to the author of that type to carefully consider how safe<br>it is for others to mutate the state of their types. Yet today both<br>sides of a property are given the same access level unless one<br>explicitly restricts the visibility of it&#39;s setter. The current behavior<br>(of properties specifically, and the access control feature as a whole)<br>achieves a balance of convenience, power, and safety that I am happy with.<br></p><p>The proposed change however sacrifices too much convenience for a<br>greater sense of safety and control by default. It&#39;s not possible to<br>accidentally override a method like it is in java or objective-c, so the<br>proposal won&#39;t help people who might accidentally override something. If<br>a developer tries to override a method or class they probably have a<br>specific reason in mind for doing so, and taking away the options that<br>this ability presents, by nature of it being the default behavior,<br>doesn&#39;t sit well with me as it has the potential to take away a good<br>tool from my toolbox.<br></p><p>I agree that API authors should have the power to restrict this<br>dimension of a type&#39;s usage, but I feel that it should be a conscious<br>choice to do so.<br></p><p>- Kevin<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>July  5, 2016 at 06:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>I think it&#39;s ultimately a good idea. Being noncommittal about subclassability/overridability—and thus forbidding it in public scope, but not making any promises about what the module does internally—is the alternative that preserves the most freedom for the module, and therefore the most appropriate default.<br></p><p>However, I don&#39;t like the `subclassable` and `overridable` keywords. They read like opposites of `final` with no implications for access level; I could easily imagine somebody marking an internal class `subclassable` assuming that it merely means it can be subclassed internally, and being very surprised (or even not noticing!) that the class has been made public. They&#39;re also long and cumbersome; that might be seen as a positive, but I think it will increase the inevitable backlash against this change.<br></p><p>I prefer the keyword `open`, which sounds like it could be a statement about the item&#39;s accessibility—and even sounds like it ought to be &quot;more public than public&quot;—and is short enough that it ought to be difficult to grumble about the change.

That improves code quality all-around.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yup<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yup, but I don’t like “subclassable class”. My preferences are:<br></p><p>#1 - “extendable class”    // explicitly clear about what I’m allowing<br>#2 - “open class”             // this is a bit vague - open how? How is it different from public?<br></p><p><br>&gt; 	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>I prefer this over “sealed”. Making classes extendable requires careful consideration, and should be explicit.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>I read through it a few times, and also the discussion last week.

Having to use a special keyword to allow a class to be subclassed from outside the module looks like the compiler has to perform some extra effort to add this &quot;subclassability feature&quot;.<br></p><p>It&#39;s not bad to allow sealing of classes. I don&#39;t see real value in it though. And `sealed` should not be the default. Either the class if final or not: for me that&#39;s a valuable distinction. &quot;sealed vs. unsealed&quot; is not.<br></p><p>The proposal is another try to prevent people from misusing the language. But misusing the language will always be possible and will always be easy. All these attempts will make the language just more complicated or harder to understand. I don&#39;t buy the performance argument either, i.e. that &quot;sealed by default&quot; will improve performance considerably for non-contrived use-cases. But I&#39;m sure you will find that out a few months after the proposal is implemented :-/<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>No<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>No, I don&#39;t think so.<br>If you have a ParentClass and a SubClass, and the ParentClass is sealed while the SubClass is subclassable.

The proposal is available here:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0117-non-public-subclassable-by-default.md<br>&gt; <br></p><p>I posted this somewhere else in another thread, but I still think a slightly different approach to all of the access namings might make more sense:<br></p><p>- everything is “sealed&quot; within its module by default, no keyword for this<br></p><p>- use “export” (formerly “public”) to mean “visible outside of the module, no subclassing or overriding externally, but overriding and subclasses allowed internally unless otherwise restricted”<br></p><p>- use “export(public)” to mean “visible outside of the module, can be subclassed or overridden externally”<br></p><p>- “export final” means that the class/method is also final within its own module<br></p><p>- using “export(public) final” *probably* doesn’t make sense, but would mean overriding/subclasses allowed externally, but not internally<br></p><p>My argument for “export” here is that it is the logical inverse of “import” which is how you get another module’s stuff into your module in the first place.<br></p><p>Then I would want to consider a rename of “internal” to “public” and “fileprivate” to “internal” so the complete list would be:<br></p><p>export - accessible outside of the module<br>public - accessible anywhere within the module<br>private - accessible only within the scope <br>internal - accessible within the same source file<br></p><p>In this way, there is nice symmetry between import/export, and then again between public/private. The source-file-based grouping of “internal” now has a name that is more unique and not immediately related to the other access keywords, either, which makes sense since it’s on a slightly different axis.<br></p><p>After all of this, the “export(public)” case rational would seem to be logical - you’re saying that the symbol is accessible outside of *this* module and subclassable/overridable within the “public” context of whatever module is importing it - hence using both “export” and “public”.<br></p><p>So anyway, I don’t know if this counts as a -1 vote or not or if this is even coherent, but this is my feedback at the moment. :)<br></p><p>l8r<br>Sean<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecdb231117dda838340bfcbb8873d28e?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Paul Cantrell</string> &lt;cantrell at pobox.com&gt;<p>July  6, 2016 at 03:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; * What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>+1, with bikeshedding.<br></p><p>To me, “subclassable” does not imply “public.” If I hadn’t read this proposal, I would be likely to declare an internal class subclassable, and then be shocked when it was exposed as public!<br></p><p>If it’s part of my public API, I want to see the word “public” on it. That should not be implicit under any circumstances. I strongly prefer any one of these to the standalone “subclassable:”<br></p><p>	• public(subclassable)<br>	• public(open)<br>	• public(extensible)<br></p><p>The extra verbosity is tolerable because subclassability by design is (should be!) the exception, not the rule.<br></p><p>&gt; * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes, it fits two patterns of Swift’s general design:<br></p><p>if one choice is the default, it is the safer one; and<br>consequential design decisions are explicit. Implicitness is reserved for obvious / redundant information that becomes noise and interferes with readability.<br></p><p>To that end…<br></p><p>&gt; * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>…open public classes run against general precedent in the language, so yes.<br></p><p>As programmers grow used to Swift, they will increasingly lean on the compiler to prompt them when there is an important type design issue to consider, or when they are doing something that compromises type safety. The absence of a compiler warning becomes important information.<br></p><p>This means that making open classes the default is not just aesthetically suboptimal; it is actively misleading.<br></p><p>&gt; * If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>No. In all the OO languages I’ve used, classes are open by default. That raises a question: is this really a good idea? Aren’t we ignoring established precedent? What about all the unauthorized subclassing we’ve done in the past?<br></p><p>I’m sympathetic to those accustomed to Objective-C, Ruby, Javascript, Python, and other languages with more fungible type systems who argue that it’s unreasonable to expect us all to use classes only as library authors intend. Monkey patching has saved many a day, they’d say. And it’s true, it has! I rely on it.<br></p><p>My counterargument: the ecosystem is changing.<br></p><p>In the era of increased open sourcing, easy forking, and more community-driven development, this concern is less severe than it used to be. I rarely use any closed-sourced libraries for iOS development. If I need to tweak some library and non-subclassibility is getting in the way, then I can fork it — and perhaps even contribute my changes back to improve the upstream project. In an open source world, “closed by default” makes a lot more sense.<br></p><p>The big exception to this is Apple itself, and the direction of this proposal implies a large cultural shift in how Apple deals with its developer community. Having the Swift language so aggressively prevent the dubious, brittle, bad-idea-but-it-gets-the-job-done workarounds that the Obj-C runtime allowed means that Apple’s platforms are going to have to be more consciously extensible, more transparent in their design decisions, and more responsive to unanticipated needs. This community right here is an exemplar.<br></p><p>Here’s thing: this big shift goes far, far beyond this proposal. Swift already rules out most any form of messing with a library’s assumptions about its own design. With or without the proposal, Apple is already getting on board with the new regime of stricter typing and more hermetically sealed libraries. They’re already going to have to make API design decisions about how and where extensibility is allowed with unprecedented caution.<br></p><p>This proposal hardly alters that tipping balance; it just removes a design inconsistency.<br></p><p>&gt; * How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>I read the proposal carefully, the discussion thread not at all.<br></p><p>Cheers,<br></p><p>Paul<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160706/e741430d/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d8867167dba9b648c6d0746a67bbc721?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Goffredo Marocchi</string> &lt;panajev at gmail.com&gt;<p>July  6, 2016 at 09:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Sent from my iPhone<br></p><p>&gt; On 6 Jul 2016, at 21:22, Paul Cantrell via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In the era of increased open sourcing, easy forking, and more community-driven development, this concern is less severe than it used to be.

It&#39;s not a slippery slope towards locking things down at a sub-library level because (1) we&#39;ve already considered and rejected the analogous sub-library-level proposal (as &quot;final by default&quot;) and (2) almost all of the justifications are tied to the specific problems that arise with library interfaces.<br></p><p>In general, Swift already treats library interfaces as a special point at which a lot of considerations change.  The most prominent example of that is access control, but there are a lot of other examples that will become more apparent as we complete the resilience model, solidify the ABI, and start really supporting binary distribution of libraries.  The basic idea is that library designers face a set of language problems that other programmers don&#39;t, and the language ought to understand that and provide a different set of features and defaults.  This is a language design that&#39;s made possible by Swift&#39;s relatively strong commitment to defining and enforcing library boundaries, as opposed to the languages you list.  To me, this is a great way to only get dogmatism when it&#39;s actually useful and necessary.<br></p><p>John.<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/831ba6eb600af4a6587f263373921bb2?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Tino Heth</string> &lt;2th at gmx.de&gt;<p>July  7, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt;  In an open source world, “closed by default” makes a lot more sense.<br>That sounds Orwellian to me: <br>War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength — and sealed is open?<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160707/170a2dd7/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d8867167dba9b648c6d0746a67bbc721?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Goffredo Marocchi</string> &lt;panajev at gmail.com&gt;<p>July  7, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>lol :)<br></p><p>On Thu, Jul 7, 2016 at 1:41 PM, Tino Heth via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;<br>&gt;  In an open source world, “closed by default” makes a lot more sense.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That sounds Orwellian to me:<br>&gt; War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength — and sealed is<br>&gt; open?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160707/7a29b004/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15ed660cd9d971062f9dd5084932a698?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>David Rönnqvist</string> &lt;david.ronnqvist at gmail.com&gt;<p>July  6, 2016 at 11:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt;   * What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>+1 (almost exclusively)<br></p><p>Writing good library code is hard and a lot of code isn&#39;t actually written to be externally subclasses (and trying to plan for subclassing can be difficult). Our team also writes &quot;final class&quot; in a lot of places and I don&#39;t like it (but wouldn&#39;t want final by default either).<br></p><p>This proposal feels like a sensible trade off to me. Having to intentionally mark classes for public subclassability leads to better safety (only classes being intended for external subclassing actually being subclassable), clarity (by documenting what&#39;s designed for subclassing/overriding), performance (by enabling optimizations if a class isn&#39;t subclasses internally) while still providing convenience within the module (enabling the authoring team to subclass and not having to put final throughout).<br></p><p>There is some negative with regards to limiting the ability to patch third party code, but I think the benefits of this proposal are worth that.<br></p><p>The behavior of Objective-C classes and @testablity are an important part of this proposal.<br></p><p>Bike sheding:<br></p><p>The subclassable/overridable pair read well on their own but it&#39;s not obvious to me that subclassable is also public and that it&#39;s not needed internally. This could be helped by requiring &quot;subclassable&quot; classes to also be marked &quot;public&quot; and making it an error to declare a class as &quot;internal subclassable&quot; or &quot;private subclassable&quot; (all 3 could have a simple fix-it).<br></p><p>I would also be fine with either &quot;open&quot; or &quot;extensible&quot; (although I could see &quot;extensible&quot; being interpreted as &quot;can have extensions&quot; instead of &quot;can be subclasses&quot;).<br></p><p>&gt;    * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt;    * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes.

It conflates different things and magically having different behavior inside and outside the module.

Of course C# has protected, which controls visibility to subclassers so you can mark things as internal protected virtual, then the overall type as public virtual. Someone can still subclass but it doesn’t matter because they can’t override anything as all the protected override points are internal… not that it was very common!<br></p><p>When you’re designing things for easy subclassing I found it much more useful to offer protected members as the override points without letting subclassers override the public interface. Much less opportunity for them to screw things up, forget to call super, etc. In the rare case where I wanted to allow them to skip super’s implementation I just added that as a parameter to the protected member.<br></p><p><br>Russ<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0a5152b275c43b493a94b5a6a868905?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Pyry Jahkola</string> &lt;pyry.jahkola at iki.fi&gt;<p>July  8, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Chris Lattner wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The review of &quot;SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly&quot; begins now and runs through July 11.

I&#39;m positive with making the subclassability of exported classes explicit, but I&#39;d reconsider the keywords proposed.<br></p><p>Given how the ecosystem has shaped up so far, there are very few cases where Swift classes could be realistically patched by subclassing and overriding. Instead, forking and recontributing open-source code is the better way to go. From my OOP in any programming languages, almost all unplanned (by library author) uses of subclassing have become terrible hacks that were hard to maintain in application code. And I don&#39;t want to imagine having to maintain a library that multiple users have patched by subclassing without a documentation of the contract between the superclass and its subclasses.<br></p><p>In Swift, classes seem to be most essentially about reference semantics and not so much about inheritance. With that, I think it&#39;s better that unlimited subclassing becomes a conscious choice by the library author, so that we also increase the probability of remembering to document what can be overridden and how. Originally, I would&#39;ve even supported making `final` the default, but adding the new &quot;sealed&quot; inheritance mode is a very good compromise that makes life easier when writing application code.<br></p><p>Sealed classes also open a new language design opportunity where `switch` cases can be proven total given a sealed class type as argument.<br></p><p>However, I also think we shouldn&#39;t merge the the `public` modifier with the newly proposed keywords. From the alternatives mentioned so far, I&#39;d give my +1 to `public open class/func` or the spelling `public(open) class`. In this position, I think it&#39;ll be unambiguous given context whether `open` acts as a keyword or not.<br></p><p>Alternatively, we could reuse the `super` keyword in this context; the only minor issue I can see in `public super class` (besides that &quot;superclass&quot; should be written without a space) is that public unsealed classes aren&#39;t the only publicly visible superclasses (sealed classes are also publicly superclasses of their public subclasses). Well, and that the &quot;superfunc&quot; in `public super func` would be an unfamiliar term, even if it&#39;s easily taught as the kind of function which you should consider calling as `super.foo(...)` somewhere in an override.<br></p><p>The proposal also left open whether the subclassability is inherited in subclasses. I think it&#39;s clear that the answer is &quot;no&quot;, and thus every subclass of a publicly subclassable superclass is only publicly subclassable if explicitly marked so.<br></p><p>&gt;    * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes, Swift should use language design opportunities like this to statically encourage thoughtful library design.<br></p><p>&gt;    * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes.

Also, the breakages in existing code would be more serious than usual.<br></p><p>The specifics:<br></p><p>Firstly, making a class public does not provide “two different” capabilities, it provides one: the class is now accessible outside the module. Using a class includes instantiating it, calling functions, accessing properties and also subclassing non final classes and methods. If you choose to make a method or class public you are already having to carefully consider its design perhaps adding guards for parameters validationetc. In this context, adding final is not really onerous.<br></p><p>Secondly, if you don’t want to go to the trouble of making your class work properly, you already have the option of making it final.<br></p><p>Thirdly, this is a huge breaking change. Not only is it a breaking change, but for a lot of people, the breakages will be outside of their control. Consider if I publish a module with a class with public methods and you subclass it in your code. Once this change is implemented, my code will still compile and pass its unit tests but your code is now broken and you are dependent on me changing my code to fix your code. <br></p><p>Fourthly, the optimisation point is a red herring. Premature optimisation is the root of all evil, they say. This is premature optimisation. In any program, the number of methods where eliminating dynamic dispatch would provide a visible benefit is tiny. In those cases, you can add the word final to the declaration (after proper performance testing).<br></p><p><br>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>The functionality to stop people subclassing and overriding where it would be dangerous to do so already exists and this coupled with the serious problem of breaking code where the fix is outside the developer’s control makes it a very bad change indeed.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>No. Swift feels to me like a really nice powerful language that is easy to program in.

However, it does point to a desire for public-and-not-subclassable classes; any other solution would either require the library author making more things public, or the compiler making it possible to accidentally call an unimplemented initializer.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I’ll send a separate message with my thoughts as the primary author of the Library Evolution model, to keep those discussions distinct. That one will have a bit more ideology in it. :-)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Jordan<br>&gt; <br>&gt; P.S. “Why not use protocols?” When a protocol has an initializer requirement, it still forces all subclasses of a conforming class to provide an implementation, i.e. the conforming class’s initializer still needs to be declared ‘required’. That means it’s subject to the same restriction: a required initializer must have as much access as the containing class.<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160709/59f4b75d/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4fe988326eed161b989d0c5521cb105?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Jordan Rose</string> &lt;jordan_rose at apple.com&gt;<p>July 10, 2016 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jul 8, 2016, at 23:47, L.

Thank you to both John and Javier. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I wanted to share a concrete use case that Daniel Dunbar relayed to me. He was working on a closed class hierarchy like the ones discussed here, where all of the subclasses are within a single module, but they are all public. The class also has a required initializer for dynamic construction, so that they could write something like this:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; internal struct ModelContext { /*…*/ }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; public class ModelBase {<br>&gt;&gt;   internal required init(context: ModelContext) { /*…*/ }<br>&gt;&gt;   // …<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; public class SimpleModel: ModelBase {<br>&gt;&gt;   internal required init(context: ModelContext) { /*…*/ }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; public class MoreComplicatedModel: ModelBase { /*…*/ }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; // (within some other type)<br>&gt;&gt; public func instantiateModelObject&lt;Model: ModelBase&gt;(_ type: Model) -&gt; Model {<br>&gt;&gt;   return type.init(context: self.context)<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; That is, a public entry point calls a required initializer with an internal argument type. This is the only way to instantiate Model objects, and the internal context type doesn’t leak out into the public API.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Then could it be that in the end it is the entire scaffolding that is poorly structured and in need of fixing, rather than altering the language to make the scaffolding work?<br></p><p>I’m afraid it isn’t my codebase, so I can’t speak to this directly, but I don’t see anything wrong with this pattern. Dynamic initialization is useful, and internal, component-specific context is hardly uncommon; if the library used either of these alone we would likely have no problem with it. Two features not composing well does sometimes indicate a flaw in the design.<br></p><p>Jordan<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160710/0c0c96ca/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d8867167dba9b648c6d0746a67bbc721?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Goffredo Marocchi</string> &lt;panajev at gmail.com&gt;<p>July  9, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>Sent from my iPhone<br></p><p>&gt; On 9 Jul 2016, at 05:39, Jordan Rose via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Of course, Swift doesn’t allow this.

The previous message shared a use case where public-but-non-subclassable made things work out much better with required initializers. This one has a bit more ideology in it.)<br></p><p>As many people have said already, this proposal is quite beneficial to library designers attempting to reason about their code, not just now but in the future as well. The model laid out in the Library Evolution document &lt;http://jrose-apple.github.io/swift-library-evolution/&gt; (often referred to as “resilience”) supports Swift libraries that want to preserve a stable binary and source interface.<br></p><p>In the Swift 2 model (and what’s currently described in that document), a public class must be final or non-final at the time it is published. It’s clearly not safe to add ‘final&#39; in a later version of the library, because a client might already have a subclass; it’s also not safe to remove ‘final’ because existing clients may have been compiled assuming there are no subclasses.<br></p><p>(Of course, we can remove this optimization, and make ‘final’ a semantic contract only. I’m deliberately avoiding most discussion of performance, but in this parenthetical I’ll note that Swift makes it possible to write code that is slower than Objective-C. This is considered acceptable because the compiler can often optimize it for a particular call site. For those who want more information about the current implementation of some of Swift’s features, I suggest watching the “Understanding Swift Performance &lt;https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/416/&gt;” talk from this year’s WWDC.)<br></p><p>With this proposal, a public class can be non-publicly-subclassable or publicly-subclassable. Once a class is publicly-subclassable (“open”), you can’t go back, of course. But a class that’s not initially open could become open in a future release of the library. All existing clients would already be equipped to deal with this, because there might be subclasses inside the library. On the other hand, the class can also be marked ‘final’, if the library author later realizes there will never be any subclasses and that both client authors and the compiler should know this.<br></p><p>One point that’s not covered in this proposal is whether making a class ‘open’ applies retroactively, i.e. if MagicLib 1.2 is the first version that makes the Magician class ‘open’, can clients deploy back to MagicLib 1.0 and expect their subclasses to work? My inclination is to say no; if it’s possible for a non-open method to be overridden in the future, a library author has to write their library as if it will be overridden now, and there’s no point in making it non-open in the first place. That would make ‘open’ a “versioned attribute &lt;http://jrose-apple.github.io/swift-library-evolution/#publishing-versioned-api&gt;” in the terminology of Library Evolution, whatever the syntax ends up being.<br></p><p>---<br></p><p>Okay, so why is this important?<br></p><p>It all comes down to reasoning about your program’s behavior. When you use a class, you’re relying on the documented behavior of that class. More concretely, the methods on the class have preconditions (“performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:) should not be called on a view controller that didn’t come from a storyboard”) and postconditions (“after calling loadViewIfNeeded(), the view controller’s view will be loaded”). When you call a method, you’re responsible for satisfying its preconditions so it can deliver on the postconditions.<br></p><p>I used UIViewController as an example, but it applies just as much to your own methods. When you call a method in your own module—maybe written by you, maybe by a coworker, maybe by an open source contributor—you’re expecting some particular behavior and output given the inputs and the current state of the program. That is, you just need to satisfy its preconditions so it can deliver on the postconditions. If it’s a method in your module, though, you might not have taken the trouble to formalize the preconditions and postconditions, since you can just go look at the implementation. Even if your expectations are violated, you’ll probably notice, because the conflict of understanding is within your own module.<br></p><p>Public overriding changes all this. While an overridable method may have particular preconditions and postconditions, it’s possible that the overrider will get that wrong, which means the library author can no longer reason about the behavior of their program. If they do a poor job documenting the preconditions and postconditions, the client and the library will almost certainly disagree about the expected behavior of a particular method, and the program won’t work correctly.<br></p><p>&quot;Doesn’t a library author have to figure out the preconditions and postconditions for a method anyway when making it public?&quot; Well, not to the same extent. It’s perfectly acceptable for a library author to document stronger preconditions and weaker postconditions than are strictly necessary. (Maybe &#39;performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:)’ has a mode that can work without storyboards, but UIKit isn’t promising that it will work.) When a library author lets people override their method, though, they&#39;re promising that the method will never be called with a weaker precondition than documented, and that nothing within their library will expect a stronger postcondition than documented.<br></p><p>(By the way, the way to look at overriding a method is the inverse of calling a method: you need to deliver on the postconditions, and you can assume the caller has satisfied the preconditions. If your understanding of those preconditions and postconditions is wrong, your program won’t work correctly, just like when you’re calling a method.)<br></p><p>This all goes double when a library author wants to release a new version of their library with different behavior. In order to make sure existing callers don’t break, they have to make sure all of the library’s documented preconditions are no stronger and postconditions are no weaker for public API. In order to make sure existing subclassers don’t break, they have to make sure all of the library’s documented preconditions are no weaker and postconditions are no stronger for overridable API.<br></p><p>(For a very concrete example of this, say you’re calling a method with the type &#39;(Int?) -&gt; Int’, and you’re passing nil. The new version of the library can’t decide to make the parameter non-optional or the return value optional, because that would break your code. Similarly, if you’re overriding a method with the type ‘(Int) -&gt; Int?’, and returning nil, the new version of the library can’t decide to make the parameter optional or the return value non-optional, because that would break your code.)<br></p><p>So, &quot;non-publicly-subclassable&quot; is a way to ease the burden on a library author. They should be thinking about preconditions and postconditions in their program anyway, but not having to worry about all the things a client might do for a method that shouldn’t be overridden means they can actually reason about the behavior—and thus the correctness—of their own program, both now and for future releases.<br></p><p>---<br></p><p>I agree with several people on this thread that non-publicly-subclassable-by-default is the same idea as internal-by-default: it means that you have to explicitly decide to support a capability before clients can start relying on it, and you are very unlikely to do so by accident. The default is “safe” in that a library author can change their mind without breaking existing clients.<br></p><p>I agree with John that even today, the entry points that happen to be public in the types that happen to be public classes are unlikely to be good entry points for fixing bugs in someone else&#39;s library. Disallowing overriding these particular entry points when a client already can&#39;t override internal methods, methods on structs, methods that use internal types, or top-level functions doesn’t really seem like a loss to me.<br></p><p>Library design is important. Controlling the public interface of a library allows for better reasoning about the behavior of code, better security (i.e. better protection of user data), and better maintainability. And whether something can be overridden is part of that interface.<br></p><p>Thanks again to Javier and John for putting this proposal together.<br>Jordan<br></p><p>P.S. There’s also an argument to be made for public-but-not-conformable protocols, i.e. protocols that can be used in generics and as values outside of a module, but cannot be conformed to.

(While you can get a similar effect using an enum, that’s a little less natural for code reuse via protocol extensions.)<br></p><p>P.P.S. For those who will argue against “better security”, you’re correct: this doesn’t prevent an attack, and I don’t have much expertise in this area.

The previous message shared<br>&gt; a use case where public-but-non-subclassable made things work out much<br>&gt; better with required initializers. This one has a bit more ideology in it.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As many people have said already, this proposal is quite beneficial to<br>&gt; library designers attempting to reason about their code, not just now but<br>&gt; in the future as well. The model laid out in the Library Evolution<br>&gt; document &lt;http://jrose-apple.github.io/swift-library-evolution/&gt; (often<br>&gt; referred to as “resilience”) supports Swift libraries that want to preserve<br>&gt; a stable binary and source interface.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In the Swift 2 model (and what’s currently described in that document), a<br>&gt; public class must be final or non-final at the time it is published. It’s<br>&gt; clearly not safe to *add* ‘final&#39; in a later version of the library,<br>&gt; because a client might already have a subclass; it’s also not safe to<br>&gt; *remove* ‘final’ because existing clients may have been compiled assuming<br>&gt; there are no subclasses.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (Of course, we can remove this optimization, and make ‘final’ a semantic<br>&gt; contract only. I’m deliberately avoiding most discussion of performance,<br>&gt; but in this parenthetical I’ll note that Swift makes it possible to write<br>&gt; code that is *slower* than Objective-C. This is considered acceptable<br>&gt; because the compiler can often optimize it for a particular call site. For<br>&gt; those who want more information about the current implementation of some of<br>&gt; Swift’s features, I suggest watching the “Understanding Swift Performance<br>&gt; &lt;https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/416/&gt;” talk from this<br>&gt; year’s WWDC.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; With this proposal, a public class can be non-publicly-subclassable or<br>&gt; publicly-subclassable. Once a class is publicly-subclassable (“open”), you<br>&gt; can’t go back, of course. But a class that’s not initially open could<br>&gt; *become* open in a future release of the library. All existing clients<br>&gt; would already be equipped to deal with this, because there might be<br>&gt; subclasses *inside* the library. On the other hand, the class can *also* be<br>&gt; marked ‘final’, if the library author later realizes there will never be<br>&gt; any subclasses and that both client authors and the compiler should know<br>&gt; this.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; One point that’s not covered in this proposal is whether making a class<br>&gt; ‘open’ applies retroactively, i.e. if MagicLib 1.2 is the first version<br>&gt; that makes the Magician class ‘open’, can clients deploy back to MagicLib<br>&gt; 1.0 and expect their subclasses to work?

The previous message shared a use case where public-but-non-subclassable made things work out much better with required initializers. This one has a bit more ideology in it.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; As many people have said already, this proposal is quite beneficial to library designers attempting to reason about their code, not just now but in the future as well. The model laid out in the Library Evolution document (often referred to as “resilience”) supports Swift libraries that want to preserve a stable binary and source interface.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In the Swift 2 model (and what’s currently described in that document), a public class must be final or non-final at the time it is published. It’s clearly not safe to add ‘final&#39; in a later version of the library, because a client might already have a subclass; it’s also not safe to remove ‘final’ because existing clients may have been compiled assuming there are no subclasses.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; (Of course, we can remove this optimization, and make ‘final’ a semantic contract only. I’m deliberately avoiding most discussion of performance, but in this parenthetical I’ll note that Swift makes it possible to write code that is slower than Objective-C. This is considered acceptable because the compiler can often optimize it for a particular call site. For those who want more information about the current implementation of some of Swift’s features, I suggest watching the “Understanding Swift Performance” talk from this year’s WWDC.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; With this proposal, a public class can be non-publicly-subclassable or publicly-subclassable. Once a class is publicly-subclassable (“open”), you can’t go back, of course. But a class that’s not initially open could become open in a future release of the library. All existing clients would already be equipped to deal with this, because there might be subclasses inside the library. On the other hand, the class can also be marked ‘final’, if the library author later realizes there will never be any subclasses and that both client authors and the compiler should know this.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; One point that’s not covered in this proposal is whether making a class ‘open’ applies retroactively, i.e. if MagicLib 1.2 is the first version that makes the Magician class ‘open’, can clients deploy back to MagicLib 1.0 and expect their subclasses to work? My inclination is to say no; if it’s possible for a non-open method to be overridden in the future, a library author has to write their library as if it will be overridden now, and there’s no point in making it non-open in the first place. That would make ‘open’ a “versioned attribute” in the terminology of Library Evolution, whatever the syntax ends up being.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ---<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Okay, so why is this important?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It all comes down to reasoning about your program’s behavior. When you use a class, you’re relying on the documented behavior of that class. More concretely, the methods on the class have preconditions (“performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:) should not be called on a view controller that didn’t come from a storyboard”) and postconditions (“after calling loadViewIfNeeded(), the view controller’s view will be loaded”). When you call a method, you’re responsible for satisfying its preconditions so it can deliver on the postconditions.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I used UIViewController as an example, but it applies just as much to your own methods. When you call a method in your own module—maybe written by you, maybe by a coworker, maybe by an open source contributor—you’re expecting some particular behavior and output given the inputs and the current state of the program. That is, you just need to satisfy its preconditions so it can deliver on the postconditions. If it’s a method in your module, though, you might not have taken the trouble to formalize the preconditions and postconditions, since you can just go look at the implementation. Even if your expectations are violated, you’ll probably notice, because the conflict of understanding is within your own module.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Public overriding changes all this. While an overridable method may have particular preconditions and postconditions, it’s possible that the overrider will get that wrong, which means the library author can no longer reason about the behavior of their program. If they do a poor job documenting the preconditions and postconditions, the client and the library will almost certainly disagree about the expected behavior of a particular method, and the program won’t work correctly.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &quot;Doesn’t a library author have to figure out the preconditions and postconditions for a method anyway when making it public?&quot; Well, not to the same extent. It’s perfectly acceptable for a library author to document stronger preconditions and weaker postconditions than are strictly necessary. (Maybe &#39;performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:)’ has a mode that can work without storyboards, but UIKit isn’t promising that it will work.) When a library author lets people override their method, though, they&#39;re promising that the method will never be called with a weaker precondition than documented, and that nothing within their library will expect a stronger postcondition than documented.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; (By the way, the way to look at overriding a method is the inverse of calling a method: you need to deliver on the postconditions, and you can assume the caller has satisfied the preconditions. If your understanding of those preconditions and postconditions is wrong, your program won’t work correctly, just like when you’re calling a method.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This all goes double when a library author wants to release a new version of their library with different behavior. In order to make sure existing callers don’t break, they have to make sure all of the library’s documented preconditions are no stronger and postconditions are no weaker for public API. In order to make sure existing subclassers don’t break, they have to make sure all of the library’s documented preconditions are no weaker and postconditions are no stronger for overridable API.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; (For a very concrete example of this, say you’re calling a method with the type &#39;(Int?) -&gt; Int’, and you’re passing nil. The new version of the library can’t decide to make the parameter non-optional or the return value optional, because that would break your code. Similarly, if you’re overriding a method with the type ‘(Int) -&gt; Int?’, and returning nil, the new version of the library can’t decide to make the parameter optional or the return value non-optional, because that would break your code.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; So, &quot;non-publicly-subclassable&quot; is a way to ease the burden on a library author. They should be thinking about preconditions and postconditions in their program anyway, but not having to worry about all the things a client might do for a method that shouldn’t be overridden means they can actually reason about the behavior—and thus the correctness—of their own program, both now and for future releases.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ---<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I agree with several people on this thread that non-publicly-subclassable-by-default is the same idea as internal-by-default: it means that you have to explicitly decide to support a capability before clients can start relying on it, and you are very unlikely to do so by accident. The default is “safe” in that a library author can change their mind without breaking existing clients.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I agree with John that even today, the entry points that happen to be public in the types that happen to be public classes are unlikely to be good entry points for fixing bugs in someone else&#39;s library. Disallowing overriding these particular entry points when a client already can&#39;t override internal methods, methods on structs, methods that use internal types, or top-level functions doesn’t really seem like a loss to me.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Library design is important. Controlling the public interface of a library allows for better reasoning about the behavior of code, better security (i.e. better protection of user data), and better maintainability.

Disallowing overriding<br>&gt; these particular entry points when a client already can&#39;t override internal<br>&gt; methods, methods on structs, methods that use internal types, or top-level<br>&gt; functions doesn’t really seem like a loss to me.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Library design is important. Controlling the public interface of a library<br>&gt; allows for better reasoning about the behavior of code, better security<br>&gt; (i.e. better protection of user data), and better maintainability. And<br>&gt; whether something can be overridden is part of that interface.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Thanks again to Javier and John for putting this proposal together.<br>&gt; Jordan<br>&gt;<br>&gt; P.S. There’s also an argument to be made for public-but-not-conformable<br>&gt; protocols, i.e. protocols that can be used in generics and as values outside<br>&gt; of a module, but cannot be conformed to. This is important for many of the<br>&gt; same reasons as it is for classes, and we’ve gotten a few requests for it.<br>&gt; (While you can get a similar effect using an enum, that’s a little less<br>&gt; natural for code reuse via protocol extensions.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; P.P.S. For those who will argue against “better security”, you’re correct:<br>&gt; this doesn’t prevent an attack, and I don’t have much expertise in this<br>&gt; area. However, I have talked to developers distributing binary frameworks<br>&gt; (despite our warnings that it isn’t supported) who have asked us for various<br>&gt; features to keep it from being easy.<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4fe988326eed161b989d0c5521cb105?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Jordan Rose</string> &lt;jordan_rose at apple.com&gt;<p>July 11, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jul 11, 2016, at 08:13, Leonardo Pessoa &lt;me at lmpessoa.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Jean, given this proposal it will be possible if the developer of the<br>&gt; library intends so.

The performance benefit also seems unnecessary for a lot of code, and if you need the performance, it’s easy enough to mark the class final.<br></p><p>Being able to subclass is critical not only to OOP design, but also Cocoa design. Making classes final by default will mean that a lot of classes will unnecessarily not support subclassing, which can complicate design.<br></p><p>This also strongly affects unit testing by getting rid of one of the easiest ways to mock input and output to a unit. It’s not enough to say third party code should be treated as black box. One of the best ways to test input and output from an object is to subclass the objects it communicates to and override the entry points. The biggest gaps I have in my code coverage are where I talk to non-virtual-by-default C++ methods and I can’t mock the output from those modules to hit all my cases.<br></p><p>As someone who writes an API for my day job, I am perfectly fine marking things as final by hand when necessary (when I finally get to jump to Swift.) It’s not inconvenient at all. I would much rather favor making public inheritance issues easier to surface in Swift. Public inheritance can be tricky, but this feels a bit like cutting off our noses to spite our own face. If you are a responsible public API vendor, you should be thinking about inheritance, or marking as final. And it’s wiping out one of Swift and Obj-C’s major advantages over C++.<br></p><p>The “final should be default because adding final after the fact is destructive” arguments are interesting, but ultimately not convincing to me. If you thought your class was safe for subclassing, but it ultimately wasn’t, this solves nothing. You’ll mark your class as subclassable, and you will ship it, and there will be issues, but it will still be too late to take things back. If you know your class is not safe for subclassing, you should mark it as final. There is no advantage here in that scenario.<br></p><p>This is all part of building a safe public API. Public API design can be difficult, but if you don’t understand safe subclassing designs, you are likely to miss the issues and mark your class as subclassable and ship it anyway. Again, the best way to tackle this is to find better ways to surface the issues. Making final the default still doesn’t solve the core issues of people not understanding the right design.<br></p><p>(I’d, ironically enough, be a lot more open to this proposal if Swift supported more dynamic things like proxies that could let you emulate subclassing without actually doing so. But I think that’s veering away from relatability of the language)<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e910871dda004717de19e83626308b5a?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Tony Allevato</string> &lt;allevato at google.com&gt;<p>July 11, 2016 at 07:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Tue, Jul 5, 2016 at 4:11 PM Chris Lattner &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The review of &quot;SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly&quot;<br>&gt; begins now and runs through July 11.

When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    * What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt;    * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt;    * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt;    * If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt;    * How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thank you,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Chris Lattner<br>&gt; Review Manager<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad5d998258bab37d23bc9555b0d6c237?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Max Desiatov</string> &lt;max.desiatov at gmail.com&gt;<p>July 12, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>-1. I strongly oppose this proposal and think that it adds substantial<br>complexity to the language with introduction of yet another set of keywords<br>that are similar to `final` and visibility modifiers, but work differently.<br>The proposal doesn&#39;t cover the behaviour of `final` and having `final` and<br>`overridable`/`subclassable` in the language at the same time would make it<br>more complex and harder to learn.<br></p><p>&gt; 06.07.2016 01:11 Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;:<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; The review of &quot;SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly&quot;<br>&gt; begins now and runs through July 11.
