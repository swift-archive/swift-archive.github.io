It would be entirely possible to have a GeneratorType whose behavior depends on some external signal and will return nil until such time as that external signal has data again. For example, you could have a GeneratorType that reads lines from stdin in a non-blocking fashion, and so it would return nil until the user has typed another line of text. Or you could have a GeneratorType that represents an atomic FIFO queue and returns nil if the queue is empty.<br></p><p>That&#39;s true, but you can still usefully test the common cases.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/969b04d28c02f951ccc03f615b9a92b3?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal] Change guarantee for GeneratorType.next() to always return nil past end</strong> from <string>Dmitri Gribenko</string> &lt;gribozavr at gmail.com&gt;<p>March  5, 2016 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Sat, Mar 5, 2016 at 5:40 PM, Brent Royal-Gordon via swift-evolution<br>&lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; In fact, I don&#39;t think the post-nil behavior of generators is even the biggest potential gotcha.

After all, if you&#39;re working with a generic sequence/generator, and the post-nil behavior is implementation-defined, then your generic code probably doesn&#39;t want to invoke post-nil behavior because it doesn&#39;t know what will happen. Defining post-nil behavior as always returning nil simply lets you skip this check in your StrictGenerator, but having post-nil behavior being implementation-defined certainly doesn&#39;t make testing this any harder.<br></p><p>And if you want to use this same StrictSequence/StrictGenerator when you&#39;re using a sequence/generator that you explicitly know defines post-nil behavior as something useful (or if you&#39;re writing a sequence/generator adaptor where your adaptor&#39;s post-nil behavior naturally matches the underlying generator&#39;s, and you want to test your code with clients that may be relying on specific post-nil behavior) then you can parameterize your StrictSequence/StrictGenerator with a flag that tells it whether to check the post-nil behavior. In fact, you may want to do that anyway to enable disabling of any of the checks, because it&#39;s certainly possible for a concrete SequenceType/GeneratorType implementation to relax any of these requirements you&#39;re checking. For example, a specific GeneratorType implementation could explicitly document that copying the generator is safe and both copies then yield the same sequence of elements.<br></p><p>-Kevin Ballard<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
