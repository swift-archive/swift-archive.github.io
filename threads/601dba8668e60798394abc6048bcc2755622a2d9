Are you talking about loop unrolling in the library?<br></p><p>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Could you add complexity clauses to all new documentation comments?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; We have discussed the names for these functions at length.  We felt<br>&gt;&gt; like the argument in &#39;rotate(firstFrom:)&#39; does not convey the<br>&gt;&gt; argument&#39;s role well.  Our suggestion is to use<br>&gt;&gt; &#39;rotate(shiftingToStart:)&#39; and &#39;rotated(shiftingToStart:)&#39;.  These<br>&gt;&gt; names emphasize that methods operate on the whole collection, shifting<br>&gt;&gt; all elements.  The argument is the index of the element that is moved<br>&gt;&gt; to the start index, and we tried to convey that by using the word<br>&gt;&gt; &#39;start&#39; instead of &#39;first&#39;.  In the standard library, &#39;first&#39; refers<br>&gt;&gt; to the element itself, not the index.  Indices use &#39;startIndex&#39; and<br>&gt;&gt; &#39;endIndex&#39;.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; We have considered a lot of alternative names, including<br>&gt;&gt; &#39;swapSubranges(boundedBy:)&#39;, &#39;rewind&#39;, &#39;splitAndSwap&#39;, &#39;swapHalves&#39;<br>&gt;&gt; and others, but they were not as good.  The problems are:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; - &#39;swapSubranges&#39; is mostly good, but &#39;subranges&#39; does not imply that<br>&gt;&gt; the two subranges cover the whole collection.  The user might<br>&gt;&gt; reasonably expect to pass two subranges that will be swapped.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; - &#39;Half&#39; implies that two parts make a whole, but it also implies that<br>&gt;&gt; two parts are of equal size, which is not the case for this API.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; - &#39;splitAndSwap&#39; implies that we are operating on the whole, but feels<br>&gt;&gt; a very roundabout way to describe the operation.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Agreed on all of this. The rotate name is hard to beat!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; For a non-mutating rotation we suggest defining separate types,<br>&gt;&gt; RotatedCollection, RotatedBidirectionalCollection, and<br>&gt;&gt; RotatedRandomAccessCollection, instead of returning a<br>&gt;&gt; FlattenCollection.  This has a few advantages.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; - We can change the non-mutating &#39;rotated()&#39; to just return the<br>&gt;&gt; collection instead of returning tuples of the collection and the<br>&gt;&gt; index.  The index of the former first element can be stored inside the<br>&gt;&gt; RotatedCollection in a property.  This change allows easier chaining<br>&gt;&gt; on &#39;.rotated()&#39;, and goes in line with the return value of the<br>&gt;&gt; mutating &#39;rotate()&#39; being discardable.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; - Using an array in the return type of &#39;rotated()&#39;<br>&gt;&gt; (FlattenCollection&lt;[Self.SubSequence]&gt;) would be less efficient than<br>&gt;&gt; it could be (extra allocation), and also feels like exposing too many<br>&gt;&gt; implementation details that we might want to change in future (for<br>&gt;&gt; example, if we get a CollectionOfTwo type).<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; - In future, when we have conditional protocol conformances in the<br>&gt;&gt; language, we would fold the three RotatedCollection types into one<br>&gt;&gt; type that conditionally conforms to collection protocols based on the<br>&gt;&gt; capabilities of the underlying collection.  We won&#39;t be able to do<br>&gt;&gt; that if some overloads return a FlattenCollection.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; For lazy &#39;rotated()&#39;, just like for non-mutating &#39;rotated()&#39;, we<br>&gt;&gt; recommend returning only one value, a LazyCollection that wraps an<br>&gt;&gt; appropriate RotatedCollection.  The RotatedCollection will store the<br>&gt;&gt; index of the former first element in a property.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Dmitri<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; -- <br>&gt;&gt; main(i,j){for(i=2;;i++){for(j=2;j&lt;i;j++){if(!(i%j)){j=0;break;}}if<br>&gt;&gt; (j){printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,i);}}} /*Dmitri Gribenko &lt;gribozavr at gmail.com&gt;*/<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5f463dd4e7af28b64ad8f0e032ee82dc?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0078: Implement a rotate algorithm, equivalent to std::rotate() in C++</strong> from <string>Nate Cook</string> &lt;natecook at gmail.com&gt;<p>May  6, 2016 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On May 6, 2016, at 3:18 PM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; on Thu May 05 2016, Nate Cook &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Thanks for the feedback, Dmitri &amp;co, this all looks excellent!
