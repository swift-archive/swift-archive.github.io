Some people are very<br>reluctant to do that, but I am not.  It benefits both efficiency and the<br>ability to reason about code.<br></p><p>&gt; The connection to the point you’re making here and the question is that adopting<br>&gt; this design style *will* lead to lots of optionals in lots of places.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         use an enum to reintroduce that value when necessary—than to `!`.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         I don’t think the above is an *improvement* over the proposal, but it’s<br>&gt;         a route<br>&gt;         that could have been taken.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     I believe it would be hard to make such a design work at all, and if you<br>&gt;     could make it work I think you&#39;d end up with exactly the problem this<br>&gt;     proposal aims to solve: references inside indices. So, I don&#39;t think<br>&gt;     it&#39;s even a possibility, really.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         To help illustrate the claim, here’s a strawman “safe” API—for<br>&gt;         illustration<br>&gt;         only, not advocacy!—that would be safer and thus perhaps more “Swift-y”:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         I think there&#39;s a prevalent misunderstanding (IOW, I don&#39;t mean to<br>&gt;         single out this post or this poster) about what “safe” means in Swift<br>&gt;         and what the features of a Swifty API are and should be. This<br>&gt;         is a big topic worthy of much more time than I can devote here, but<br>&gt;         here&#39;s a thought to start with:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         A Swifty API helps you reason effectively about the correctness of your<br>&gt;         code, and in part that means we provide enough preconditions on<br>&gt;         arguments to avoid complicating result types, and code to handle<br>&gt;         results, with optional-ness.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         -- <br>&gt;         Dave<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         _______________________________________________<br>&gt;         swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;         swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;         https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         _______________________________________________<br>&gt;         swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;         swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;         https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     -- <br>&gt;     Dave<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     _______________________________________________<br>&gt;     swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;     swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;     https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
