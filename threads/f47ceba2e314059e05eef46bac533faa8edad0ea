I suspect that Core Data is trying to follow this convention, but Swift doesn&#39;t generate setters using this pattern.<br></p><p>It would be nice if you could write something like this:<br></p><p>	var isFoo: Bool {<br>		get<br>		@objc(setFoo:) set<br>	}<br></p><p>But unfortunately you don&#39;t seem to be able to. Perhaps the simplest fix is to say:<br></p><p>	@objc(foo) var isFoo: Bool<br></p><p>And adjust your managed object model accordingly.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0a2c0bcff308a97d2617cdba339914c6?s=50"></div><header><strong>CoreData weirdness in development build</strong> from <string>Charles Lane</string> &lt;clane_47 at bellsouth.net&gt;<p>June  8, 2016 at 07:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>Thanks Brent, sounds reasonable. Although I don’t think this was a problem in pre-Swift 3.0 builds. I think I’ll just avoid using attributes beginning with ‘is’ in the managed object model!<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
