I would move the<br>expensive calculation into its own private method and rewrite your example<br>like this:<br></p><p>return cachedValue ?? calculatedValue()<br></p><p>In my opinion that would fit better with the single responsibility<br>principle and make unit testing easier.<br></p><p>John<br></p><p>&gt; -1 as there IMO some confusion between all these `not` and `else` and the<br>&gt; meaning of the expression at all is not obvious for me: &quot;check that not<br>&gt; allowed to assign _someExpensiveResult to some instance cachedValue,<br>&gt; otherwise return something&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This really looks nice, clean and obvious :<br>&gt;<br>&gt; guard cachedValue == nil else {<br>&gt; // here you need just to fast return unwrapped value of cachedValue<br>&gt; // so, IMO unwrapping it in this block is OK<br>&gt; return cachedValue!<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; // here you want to have cachedValue == nil, so you&#39;ll need to unwrap<br>&gt; it(after assignment) in any case.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What I can see as improvement in this direction, something like this:<br>&gt; guard cachedValue == nil else let cachedValue! {<br>&gt; // here you can use unwrapped cachedValue<br>&gt; return cachedValue<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hmm... Btw, what about improving in optional binding: It is common to<br>&gt; shadow optional value name with unwrapped value with same name:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; if let value = value {...} // too much noise<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What about introduce such syntax:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; if let value! {<br>&gt; // unwrapped value here<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Seems like clear and obvious about what does this mean. Opinions?

There is literally no other way to satisfy the guard<br>statement; our optional bindings only go one-way can’t be evaluated.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; What about if we introduced a “not” modifier to optional bindings?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; guard not let cachedValue = _someExpensiveResult else { return<br>cachedValue }<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; This obviously wouldn’t make sense for “if let…” switching, as the<br>variables get bound in the ‘else’ block and the code wouldn’t be very<br>readable. For the special case of a guard statement, though, which only has<br>an ‘else’ block, it does make some sense.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; If we had something like this, certainly in my code, I’d be able to<br>eliminate almost all (maybe even all) remaining force-unwraps of optionals;<br>that’s great! It’d be amazing if the language was expressive enough that<br>you could go without ever having to force-unwrap an optional. And it just<br>makes sense.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Thoughts?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Karl<br>&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; &gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; &gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160516/3b7f3a35/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
