You need to somehow convert a closure (a pointer to a bunch of captured variables with a pointer to a function embedded inside it) into a selector (a pointer to a table of selectors inside the Objective-C runtime, which does not do any normal memory management); I just don&#39;t see how you make that work. Saying &quot;let&#39;s do this thing&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s *possible* to do the thing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I get that they are different but I had the idea that the compiler could generate a unique name for each closure which when referenced by a selector it would invoke.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But this would be irrelevant if we moved towards closure Apis.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. What about other uses for selectors? addAction() is all well and good, but you also need removeAction(), and Swift closures don&#39;t have stable identities to test with.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I question when we use things such as removeAction? I&#39;ve only used addAction. But I guess again if we moved to closure Apis this point would be moot.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To me the only case that needs selectors is performSelector or Nsinvocation. The others can be replaced by closures and the selector api to be deprecated or to show a warning in swift :) (Xcode could even help migrate by moving it to a closure that calls the function the selector was pointing to)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not a compiler expert so I rely on the swift team to tell me what&#39;s possible (although at this early stage I think it&#39;s more important to figure out what we want and not be bound by what&#39;s possible right now)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How would the closure based API work with Interface Builder ?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/831ba6eb600af4a6587f263373921bb2?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Idea] Expression to retrieve the Objective-C selector of a method</strong> from <string>Tino Heth</string> &lt;2th at gmx.de&gt;<p>December 30, 2015 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Ah good point, in swift you can return a function as a closure (see that link) so interface builder could bind an action.<br>afaics this cannot work when myClass is nil:<br>The transponder chain might be invisible on iOS, but for OS X, it is vital.<br></p><p>Tino<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/674fead3bfff884c72fa02c35d68f258?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Idea] Expression to retrieve the Objective-C selector of a method</strong> from <string>James Campbell</string> &lt;james at supmenow.com&gt;<p>December 30, 2015 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>I&#39;m not as familiar with OS X but why is it vital there ? <br></p><p>Also for Linux this api is unneeded since there is no access to objective c <br></p><p>Sent from my iPhone<br></p><p>&gt; On 30 Dec 2015, at 16:06, Tino Heth &lt;2th at gmx.de&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Ah good point, in swift you can return a function as a closure (see that link) so interface builder could bind an action.<br>&gt; afaics this cannot work when myClass is nil:<br>&gt; The transponder chain might be invisible on iOS, but for OS X, it is vital.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Tino<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/831ba6eb600af4a6587f263373921bb2?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Idea] Expression to retrieve the Objective-C selector of a method</strong> from <string>Tino Heth</string> &lt;2th at gmx.de&gt;<p>December 30, 2015 at 09:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; I&#39;m not as familiar with OS X but why is it vital there ? <br></p><p>&gt; Do you have an example of use ?<br></p><p>If those questions are for me ;-):<br>Afair (have to do iOS most of the time now), &quot;Undo&quot; is the most prominent example.
