Attributes essentially function as adjectives, describing the declarations they are applied to. `nonescaping` and `nonreturning` are more adjective-like than `noescape` and `noreturn`, and thus are more appropriate names.<br></p><p>I don&#39;t find the term-of-art argument compelling for `noreturn`; it&#39;s a rarely used feature even in the languages that support it. But that&#39;s just me.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. This is the time to clean these things up.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. We are currently in a big push to rationalize Swift naming, and this move is compatible with that push.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>Most languages I&#39;ve used are not really very good at assigning parts of speech to different categories of language constructs.
