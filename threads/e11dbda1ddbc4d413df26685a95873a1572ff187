The<br>&gt;&gt; keepers of Cocoa APIs tell me that, since several years ago, they moved<br>&gt;&gt; away from adding prepositions to secondary selector pieces to make<br>&gt;&gt; things more sentence-like.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes, I’ve noticed that as well. <br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem I see is that there is a mixed bag of what &quot;good&quot; APIs<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; look like. And when push comes to shove, code wins. The libraries<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; exposed in code, even through the ObjC bridging, will be used as the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; basis of what determines what good Swift APIs look like more than a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; published doc.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Yep.  But a big part of the reason to publish the doc is so we can<br>&gt;&gt; decide what direction to push the library APIs.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I agree. And really, I find most of the doc fairly good.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The reason &quot;for&quot; is there is that otherwise you can&#39;t tell what the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; relationship between the observer and the keyPath is.  For example, if<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it had been &quot;at&quot; instead of &quot;for,&quot; it would completely change the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meaning. &quot;Of&quot; would probably be more descriptive, frankly.  But the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; example isn&#39;t trying to illustrate anything about that preposition or<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that relationship.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Right, but the argument is that the API is indeed better with the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;for&quot; preposition. I believe it is, I think you are also saying that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; it is.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Yes.  So... what are we arguing about?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; At the heart of it, that the guidelines don’t seem to help one down a<br>&gt; path to use prepositions, but rather only descriptive nouns.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So in one sense you are arguing to make things more English-like<br>&gt; because they read better at the call site, but on the other, you’ve<br>&gt; stated APIs reading more English-like is a non-goal. Basically, I<br>&gt; think the guideline tries to give some rules on how to get get APIs,<br>&gt; but doesn’t talk much about what a good API is.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This is the closest guideline that I think attempts to address it:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Clarity at the point of use is your most important goal. Code is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read far more than it is written.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; But the clarity here is, ironically, inherently ambiguous. Clarity<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; could mean to make the weak type information known. Clarity could be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; about intention of how the parameter could be used. Clarity could<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; simply be a more verbose name that provides additional context. I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; think it would be clear to have guidelines that actually describe what<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; you think make up a good call site.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; We intend that to mean &quot;clarity of semantics.&quot;  Would that change, um,<br>&gt;&gt; clear this up for you?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Maybe so.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; thing.strideTo(10, stride: 1) // clear<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; thing.strideTo(10, by: 1)     // clear and linguistically better<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; thing.strideTo(10, 1)         // not clear<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Actually I think the first is unclear simply because the word &quot;stride&quot;<br>&gt;&gt; takes two different roles, one as a noun and one as a verb.  It&#39;s<br>&gt;&gt; possible to misinterpret the 1 as being an expression of the word in the<br>&gt;&gt; base name, or at least it&#39;s possible to be confused by that until you<br>&gt;&gt; work out all the reasons that it doesn&#39;t make sense.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Both provide some amount clarity at the call site as the value of 1 is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; quite clear what it means. So in one sense, I agree that the defaults<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; of the language today push you towards clarity.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; To me, the guidelines, as I understand them, lead us to the first<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; option when I believe the intent is to actually get to the second<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; usage.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Yes, IMO that is the intent!  But why do you think they lead us to the<br>&gt;&gt; first option?  Because they explicitly mention using nouns to clarify<br>&gt;&gt; roles?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yeah. I don’t think you actually mean descriptive nouns.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; However, indeed someone thinks that we should use &quot;at&quot;, but based on<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; the guidelines, it&#39;s really hard to understand why:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -  mutating func insert(newElement: Iterator.Element, atIndex i: Int)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; +  mutating func insert(newElement: Iterator.Element, at i: Int)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, I agree that &quot;at&quot; reads better at the call site. However, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t provide any real clarity over the default &quot;index&quot; (sidenote: i<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; is still a bad choice ;)), <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; It all depends on what it does for the doc comment.  IMO there&#39;s nothing<br>&gt;&gt; wrong with “Inserts `newElement` before the `i`th element, or at the end<br>&gt;&gt; if `i == count`”.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hmm… we disagree on that point. If I need to go the documentation to<br>&gt; get basic clarification of the parameter, I’m not really sure what the<br>&gt; point of the label is then.<br></p><p>I don&#39;t understand your point.  The argument label (“at”) appears at the<br>use-site.  The parameter name (“i”) appears only at the declaration<br>site.  I&#39;m saying the name of the parameter should be chosen to make the<br>documentation comment read well.  Are you arguing that it shouldn&#39;t?<br></p><p>Or are you arguing that<br></p><p>  /// Inserts `newElement` before the `i`th element, or at the end<br>  /// if `i == count`<br>  mutating func insert(newElement: Iterator.Element, at i: Int)<br></p><p>would read better with a different name in place of `i`?<br></p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; I actually really hard pressed to come up with a definitive example as<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; to why that should be allowed. The best I can argue is that &quot;add&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; itself is too generic and could be confused on the implementing type<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; that may also have an &quot;add&quot; function. However, the additional label<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; information helps with that.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; You have to consider how this protocol is going to be used; it&#39;s a<br>&gt;&gt; mix-in that will be broadly applied to many things that could add an<br>&gt;&gt; NSObject for many purposes.  Unfortunately, as hard as we tried, we were<br>&gt;&gt; unable to come up with guidelines that actually make API design easy!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Agreed. API design isn’t easy. =)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; However, I absolutely believe that the &quot;strideTo/strideThrough&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; example is clearly on the side of really being part of the argument<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; label. In both cases we are striding, the difference is on where we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; stop.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; extension Strideable {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -  public func stride(to end: Self, by stride: Stride) -&gt; StrideTo&lt;Self&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; +  public func strideTo(end: Self, by stride: Stride) -&gt; StrideTo&lt;Self&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; extension Strideable {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -  public func stride(through end: Self, by stride: Stride) -&gt; StrideThrough&lt;Self&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; +  public func strideThrough(end: Self, by stride: Stride) -&gt; StrideThrough&lt;Self&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This change seems to be simply because the usage of labelled first<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; parameters are frowned up, not because it&#39;s actually a better place to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; describe what is going on.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I can&#39;t argue with you here.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So the question is this though: what is the better Swift API? I think<br>&gt; examples like these and reasons as to why one is chosen over the other<br>&gt; at least help with the guidelines being more inclusive. <br></p><p>Yeah, the rationales that led to the guidelines specifying #2 may be<br>hard to appreciate.  I&#39;m going to lay them out here so we can talk about<br>whether and how to incorporate them in the document (assuming that the<br>guidelines&#39; ruling on that API won&#39;t change):<br></p><p>* Simple guidelines are better than complex guidelines.<br></p><p>* Guidelines with exceptions and special cases are more complex.<br></p><p>* We don&#39;t have a clear rule for deciding that one API needs/doesn&#39;t<br>  need a first argument label.<br></p><p>* Even if we come up with such a rule, if it can&#39;t be *automated* in the<br>  importer, Cocoa will fail to follow the guideline in Swift.  So for<br>  any rule that considers high-level concepts like the “semantic<br>  connection between parameters,” there needs to at least be a heuristic<br>  that manages to approximate it when applied to Cocoa APIs.<br></p><p>* If we say “do it where it makes sense,” programmers will waste<br>  countless hours arguing about whether it makes sense in a given case.<br>  One great value of API guidelines is that they prevent that kind of<br>  rat-holing.<br></p><p>&gt; I agree that it’s very hard to generalize something as subjective as a<br>&gt; “good API”. So in light of that, I think more examples of some of the<br>&gt; boundaries edges at least give people some reference to compare ask,<br>&gt; “is my API more like this or more like that?”<br></p><p>...so in many ways, the choice to ban first argument labels is not about<br>what&#39;s good for a particular API, but about what&#39;s good for the whole<br>surface area of our code, and what&#39;s good for programmers using the<br>guidelines.<br></p><p>I&#39;m still hopeful, actually, that we may be able to come up with a<br>better rule for first argument labels, but the points above are what<br>we&#39;re up against, and I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s an appropriate place in the<br>guidelines document to spell them out.<br></p><p>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m trying to, but we&#39;re not really following the ObjC guidelines<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; either. At least on paper. I think you keep talking about readable<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; APIs, but I feel the guidelines keep talking more about<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; descriptive. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The difference is subtle, I agree. But I think it&#39;s the difference<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; between these two APIs:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; items.insert(12, atIndex: 2)  // or items.insert(12, at: 2)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; items.insert(12, index: 2)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, it&#39;s about which is supposed to be &quot;canonical&quot; Swift.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; OK, I&#39;ll try to come up with some wording adjustments that sort this out.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Thanks for your patience,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Thanks for being willing to listen and discuss!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -David<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/012bc4c5e7b0c2829fff88611143c108?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0023 API Design Guidelines</strong> from <string>David Owens II</string> &lt;david at owensd.io&gt;<p>January 27, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jan 26, 2016, at 1:32 PM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It all depends on what it does for the doc comment.
