It?s pretty straightforward to call C APIs from Swift. You just need to learn your way around a few glue classes like UnsafePointer*. The best reference for now would be Apple?s book Using Swift With Cocoa And Objective-C. I don?t think that book is part of the open-source drop, but you can get it for free from the iBooks store.<br></p><p>?Jens<br></p><p>* Just be careful to encapsulate all the unsafe parts of the code into a class or module that exposes a safe API, then use that API in your app code itself. If you go sprinkling unsafe stuff all over your app, it?s going to be really nasty to debug...<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20151203/8b65784e/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/edbd5f1c2f535b14165ae883fa7c3f37?s=50"></div><header><strong>IDE for Linux</strong> from <string>Jens Alfke</string> &lt;jens at mooseyard.com&gt;<p>December  3, 2015 at 03:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Dec 3, 2015, at 3:32 PM, Joe Groff &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Developing iPhone apps will likely only ever be officially supported on Macs running Xcode. You won&#39;t be able to build iPhone apps using Swift on Linux.<br></p><p>Yup. The Linux version of Swift is for building code that runs on Linux. If you wanted it to build code that runs on iOS there are a bajillion other things you?d need that aren?t included ? ARM cross-compilation, Mach-O executable generation, integrating with Apple?s Objective-C ABIs, a full set of headers for the iOS frameworks, and so on.<br></p><p>?Jens<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20151203/a2bb93d8/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
