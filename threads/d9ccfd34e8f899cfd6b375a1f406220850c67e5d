Here is an example of<br>&gt;&gt; a real-work scenario app developers might walk into:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 1) A class is developed without subclassing in mind by one developer.<br>&gt;&gt; 2) After the original developer is gone another developer adds some<br>&gt;&gt; subclasses without stopping to think about whether the original developer<br>&gt;&gt; designed for subclassing, thereby introducing subtle bugs into the app.<br>&gt;&gt; 3) After the second developer is gone the bugs are discovered, but by<br>&gt;&gt; this time there are nontrivial dependencies on the subclasses.<br>&gt;&gt; 4) A third developer who probably has little or no context for the<br>&gt;&gt; decisions made by previous developers is tasked with fixing the bugs.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; This can be quite a knot to untangle, especially if there are problems<br>&gt;&gt; modifying the superclass to properly support the subclasses (maybe this<br>&gt;&gt; breaks the contract the superclass has with its original clients).<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; It may have been possible to avoid the whole mess if the second developer<br>&gt;&gt; was required to add &#39;inheritable&#39; and &#39;overrideable&#39; keywords or similar.<br>&gt;&gt; They are already required to revisit the source of it while adding the<br>&gt;&gt; keywords which may lead to consideration of whether the implementation is<br>&gt;&gt; sufficient to support inheritance in their currently intended manner.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Implementation inheritance is a blunt tool that often leads to<br>&gt;&gt; unanticipated problems.  IMO a modern language should steer developers away<br>&gt;&gt; from it and strive to reduce the cases where it is necessary or more<br>&gt;&gt; convenient.  Making final the default would help to do this.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Supporting sealed classes and methods that can only be subclassed or<br>&gt;&gt; overridden within the same module is not in conflict with final by<br>&gt;&gt; default.  Both are good ideas IMO and I would like to see both in Swift.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I hope the core team is willing to revisit this decision with community<br>&gt;&gt; input.

I also believe use of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; subclasses and overrides in ways the library author may not have intended<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; to is a fragile technique that is likely to eventually cause as many<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; problems as it solves.  I have been programming a long time and have never<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; run into a case where this technique was the only way or even the best way<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; to accomplish the task at hand.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One additional motivation for making final the default that has not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; been discussed yet is the drive towards making Swift a protocol oriented<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; language.  IMO protocols should be the first tool considered when dynamic<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; polymorphism is necessary.  Inheritance should be reserved for cases where<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; other approaches won&#39;t work (and we should seek to reduce the number of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; problems where that is the case).  Making final the default for classes and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; methods would provide a subtle (or maybe not so subtle) hint in this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; direction.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I know the Swift team at Apple put a lot of thought into the defaults<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; in Swift.  I agree with most of them.  Enabling subclassing and overriding<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; by default is the one case where I think a significant mistake was made.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Our current intent is that public subclassing and overriding will be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; locked down by default, but internal subclassing and overriding will not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; be.  I believe that this strikes the right balance, and moreover that it is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; consistent with the general language approach to code evolution, which is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; to promote “consequence-free” rapid development by:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  (1) avoiding artificial bookkeeping obstacles while you’re hacking up<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; the initial implementation of a module, but<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  (2) not letting that initial implementation make implicit source and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; binary compatibility promises to code outside of the module and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  (3) providing good language tools for incrementally building those<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; initial prototype interfaces into stronger internal abstractions.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; All the hard limitations in the defaults are tied to the module<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; boundary because we assume that it’s straightforward to fix any problems<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; within the module if/when you decided you made a mistake earlier.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; So, okay, a class is subclassable by default, and it wasn’t really<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; designed for that, and now there are subclasses in the module which are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; causing problems.  As long as nobody&#39;s changed the default (which they<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; could have done carelessly in either case, but are much less likely to do<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; if it’s only necessary to make an external subclass), all of those<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; subclasses will still be within the module, and you still have free rein to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; correct that initial design mistake.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; John.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; --<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Javier Soto _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; --<br>&gt; Javier Soto<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; --<br>Javier Soto<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151218/8657a261/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e9b374b9587bd8da1a1a027c8716ac0d?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>Rod Brown</string> &lt;rodney.brown6 at icloud.com&gt;<p>December 18, 2015 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>That’s definitely a fair point.<br></p><p>The issue though is that this proposal would be a rather heavy handed change to make on the bet that Swift frameworks would all be designed that way.

As long as nobody&#39;s changed the default (which they could have done carelessly in either case, but are much less likely to do if it’s only necessary to make an external subclass), all of those subclasses will still be within the module, and you still have free rein to correct that initial design mistake.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; John.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -- <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Javier Soto  _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; -- <br>&gt;&gt; Javier Soto<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151217/f3db45b9/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f822334c2f6ebeafd3a41cd44c82a62b?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>Andrey Tarantsov</string> &lt;andrey at tarantsov.com&gt;<p>December 21, 2015 at 03:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>This is another proposal that&#39;s right on principle, but breaks down in real-world scenarios.<br></p><p>&gt; To play devils advocate, take for example UINavigationController in UIKit on iOS.<br></p><p>This.<br></p><p>Real iOS apps subclass and override things that were never supposed to be overridden, swizzle iOS internals and do a lot of other nasty stuff, because sometimes that&#39;s the only way to get the effect you want, and you get to test betas of future iOS releases anyway, so if something breaks, you&#39;ll catch it and release a fix.<br></p><p>I&#39;m really worried about the world where monkey-patching iOS internals is no longer possible.

Either way you may have design issues go unnoticed until someone needs to subclass to get the behavior they want. So when you reach that point, should the system error on the side of rigid safety or dangerous flexibility?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is a nice summary of the tradeoff.  I strongly prefer safety myself and I believe the preference for safety fits well with the overall direction of Swift.  If a library author discovers a design oversight and later decides they should have allowed for additional flexibility it is straightforward to allow for this without breaking existing client code.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Many of the examples cited in argument against final by default have to do with working around library or framework bugs.  I understand the motivation to preserve this flexibility bur don&#39;t believe bug workarounds are a good way to make language design decisions. I also believe use of subclasses and overrides in ways the library author may not have intended to is a fragile technique that is likely to eventually cause as many problems as it solves.  I have been programming a long time and have never run into a case where this technique was the only way or even the best way to accomplish the task at hand.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One additional motivation for making final the default that has not been discussed yet is the drive towards making Swift a protocol oriented language.  IMO protocols should be the first tool considered when dynamic polymorphism is necessary.  Inheritance should be reserved for cases where other approaches won&#39;t work (and we should seek to reduce the number of problems where that is the case).  Making final the default for classes and methods would provide a subtle (or maybe not so subtle) hint in this direction.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I know the Swift team at Apple put a lot of thought into the defaults in Swift.

I really don&#39;t understand how this would conflict with &quot;consequence-free&quot; rapid development.  It is a good thing to require people to stop and think before using inheritance.  Often there is a more appropriate alternative.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The assumption that it is straightforward to fix problems within a module if you later decide you made a mistake is true in some respects but not in others.  It is not uncommon for apps to be monolithic rather than being well factored into separate modules, with many developers contributing and the team changing over time.  While this is not ideal it is reality.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When you have the full source it is certainly *possible* to solve any problem but it is often not straightforward at all.  Here is an example of a real-work scenario app developers might walk into:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) A class is developed without subclassing in mind by one developer.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) After the original developer is gone another developer adds some subclasses without stopping to think about whether the original developer designed for subclassing, thereby introducing subtle bugs into the app.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) After the second developer is gone the bugs are discovered, but by this time there are nontrivial dependencies on the subclasses.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4) A third developer who probably has little or no context for the decisions made by previous developers is tasked with fixing the bugs.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This can be quite a knot to untangle, especially if there are problems modifying the superclass to properly support the subclasses (maybe this breaks the contract the superclass has with its original clients).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It may have been possible to avoid the whole mess if the second developer was required to add &#39;inheritable&#39; and &#39;overrideable&#39; keywords or similar.  They are already required to revisit the source of it while adding the keywords which may lead to consideration of whether the implementation is sufficient to support inheritance in their currently intended manner.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Implementation inheritance is a blunt tool that often leads to unanticipated problems.  IMO a modern language should steer developers away from it and strive to reduce the cases where it is necessary or more convenient.

I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really don&#39;t understand how this would conflict with &quot;consequence-free&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rapid development.  It is a good thing to require people to stop and think<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before using inheritance.  Often there is a more appropriate alternative.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The assumption that it is straightforward to fix problems within a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; module if you later decide you made a mistake is true in some respects but<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not in others.  It is not uncommon for apps to be monolithic rather than<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being well factored into separate modules, with many developers<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contributing and the team changing over time.  While this is not ideal it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is reality.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When you have the full source it is certainly *possible* to solve any<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem but it is often not straightforward at all.  Here is an example of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a real-work scenario app developers might walk into:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) A class is developed without subclassing in mind by one developer.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) After the original developer is gone another developer adds some<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; subclasses without stopping to think about whether the original developer<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; designed for subclassing, thereby introducing subtle bugs into the app.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) After the second developer is gone the bugs are discovered, but by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this time there are nontrivial dependencies on the subclasses.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4) A third developer who probably has little or no context for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; decisions made by previous developers is tasked with fixing the bugs.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This can be quite a knot to untangle, especially if there are problems<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; modifying the superclass to properly support the subclasses (maybe this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; breaks the contract the superclass has with its original clients).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It may have been possible to avoid the whole mess if the second<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; developer was required to add &#39;inheritable&#39; and &#39;overrideable&#39; keywords or<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; similar.  They are already required to revisit the source of it while<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adding the keywords which may lead to consideration of whether the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; implementation is sufficient to support inheritance in their currently<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intended manner.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Implementation inheritance is a blunt tool that often leads to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unanticipated problems.  IMO a modern language should steer developers away<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from it and strive to reduce the cases where it is necessary or more<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; convenient.  Making final the default would help to do this.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Supporting sealed classes and methods that can only be subclassed or<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; overridden within the same module is not in conflict with final by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; default.  Both are good ideas IMO and I would like to see both in Swift.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope the core team is willing to revisit this decision with community<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; input.  If not I will let it go, although I doubt I will ever agree with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the current decision.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Matthew<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sent from my iPad<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Dec 7, 2015, at 10:30 PM, John McCall &lt;rjmccall at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; On Dec 7, 2015, at 7:18 PM, Matthew Johnson via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Defaults of public sealed/final classes and final methods on a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class by default are a tougher call.

I strongly prefer safety<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; myself and I believe the preference for safety fits well with the overall<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; direction of Swift.  If a library author discovers a design oversight and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; later decides they should have allowed for additional flexibility it is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; straightforward to allow for this without breaking existing client code.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Many of the examples cited in argument against final by default have<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do with working around library or framework bugs.  I understand the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; motivation to preserve this flexibility bur don&#39;t believe bug workarounds<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are a good way to make language design decisions. I also believe use of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; subclasses and overrides in ways the library author may not have intended<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to is a fragile technique that is likely to eventually cause as many<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problems as it solves.  I have been programming a long time and have never<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; run into a case where this technique was the only way or even the best way<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to accomplish the task at hand.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One additional motivation for making final the default that has not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been discussed yet is the drive towards making Swift a protocol oriented<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; language.  IMO protocols should be the first tool considered when dynamic<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; polymorphism is necessary.  Inheritance should be reserved for cases where<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other approaches won&#39;t work (and we should seek to reduce the number of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problems where that is the case).  Making final the default for classes and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; methods would provide a subtle (or maybe not so subtle) hint in this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; direction.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I know the Swift team at Apple put a lot of thought into the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; defaults in Swift.  I agree with most of them.  Enabling subclassing and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; overriding by default is the one case where I think a significant mistake<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was made.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Our current intent is that public subclassing and overriding will be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; locked down by default, but internal subclassing and overriding will not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be.  I believe that this strikes the right balance, and moreover that it is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consistent with the general language approach to code evolution, which is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to promote “consequence-free” rapid development by:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  (1) avoiding artificial bookkeeping obstacles while you’re hacking<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up the initial implementation of a module, but<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  (2) not letting that initial implementation make implicit source and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; binary compatibility promises to code outside of the module and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  (3) providing good language tools for incrementally building those<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; initial prototype interfaces into stronger internal abstractions.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; All the hard limitations in the defaults are tied to the module<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; boundary because we assume that it’s straightforward to fix any problems<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; within the module if/when you decided you made a mistake earlier.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; So, okay, a class is subclassable by default, and it wasn’t really<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; designed for that, and now there are subclasses in the module which are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; causing problems.  As long as nobody&#39;s changed the default (which they<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could have done carelessly in either case, but are much less likely to do<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if it’s only necessary to make an external subclass), all of those<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; subclasses will still be within the module, and you still have free rein to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correct that initial design mistake.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; John.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; --<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Javier Soto  _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; --<br>&gt;&gt; Javier Soto<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -Dave<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151221/6b9bb79c/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/06c1dcc7dce6a93d194b9c013376e3f0?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>Joe Groff</string> &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt;<p>December 21, 2015 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Dec 21, 2015, at 10:04 AM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Dec 20, 2015, at 3:51 PM, Michael Buckley via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; +0.

Making it the default is less safety than suffering.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Brent Royal-Gordon<br>&gt; Architechies<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d53b7c5f9b5f5557b9082face9b632a0?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>Dave Abrahams</string> &lt;dabrahams at apple.com&gt;<p>December 21, 2015 at 10:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Dec 21, 2015, at 10:31 PM, Brent Royal-Gordon &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; In my considerable experience with C++, that is not at all where we are today.

Making final the default for classes and methods would provide a subtle (or maybe not so subtle) hint in this direction.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I know the Swift team at Apple put a lot of thought into the defaults in Swift.

I believe that this strikes the right balance, and moreover that it is consistent with the general language approach to code evolution, which is to promote “consequence-free” rapid development by:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  (1) avoiding artificial bookkeeping obstacles while you’re hacking up the initial implementation of a module, but<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  (2) not letting that initial implementation make implicit source and binary compatibility promises to code outside of the module and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  (3) providing good language tools for incrementally building those initial prototype interfaces into stronger internal abstractions.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; All the hard limitations in the defaults are tied to the module boundary because we assume that it’s straightforward to fix any problems within the module if/when you decided you made a mistake earlier.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; So, okay, a class is subclassable by default, and it wasn’t really designed for that, and now there are subclasses in the module which are causing problems.  As long as nobody&#39;s changed the default (which they could have done carelessly in either case, but are much less likely to do if it’s only necessary to make an external subclass), all of those subclasses will still be within the module, and you still have free rein to correct that initial design mistake.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; John.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -- <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Javier Soto  _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151217/da5ea8a7/attachment-0001.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d04f3c48ab68a1dd3e712dcab04004ce?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>Curt Clifton</string> &lt;curt at omnigroup.com&gt;<p>December 19, 2015 at 07:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>I&#39;m not sure how many minuses I have to give, but I&#39;d give them all to this proposal.<br></p><p>Anyone who tries to ship products on release day of Apple&#39;s operating system updates spends most of August and September writing horrible hacks so that their users are insulated from OS bugs as much as possible.

Here is an example of a real-work scenario app developers might walk into:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) A class is developed without subclassing in mind by one developer.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) After the original developer is gone another developer adds some subclasses without stopping to think about whether the original developer designed for subclassing, thereby introducing subtle bugs into the app.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) After the second developer is gone the bugs are discovered, but by this time there are nontrivial dependencies on the subclasses.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4) A third developer who probably has little or no context for the decisions made by previous developers is tasked with fixing the bugs.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This can be quite a knot to untangle, especially if there are problems modifying the superclass to properly support the subclasses (maybe this breaks the contract the superclass has with its original clients).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It may have been possible to avoid the whole mess if the second developer was required to add &#39;inheritable&#39; and &#39;overrideable&#39; keywords or similar.  They are already required to revisit the source of it while adding the keywords which may lead to consideration of whether the implementation is sufficient to support inheritance in their currently intended manner.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Implementation inheritance is a blunt tool that often leads to unanticipated problems.  IMO a modern language should steer developers away from it and strive to reduce the cases where it is necessary or more convenient.  Making final the default would help to do this.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Supporting sealed classes and methods that can only be subclassed or overridden within the same module is not in conflict with final by default.  Both are good ideas IMO and I would like to see both in Swift.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope the core team is willing to revisit this decision with community input.  If not I will let it go, although I doubt I will ever agree with the current decision.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Matthew<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sent from my iPad<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Dec 7, 2015, at 10:30 PM, John McCall &lt;rjmccall at apple.com &lt;mailto:rjmccall at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; On Dec 7, 2015, at 7:18 PM, Matthew Johnson via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Defaults of public sealed/final classes and final methods on a class by default are a tougher call.

I understand the motivation to preserve this flexibility bur don&#39;t believe bug workarounds are a good way to make language design decisions. I also believe use of subclasses and overrides in ways the library author may not have intended to is a fragile technique that is likely to eventually cause as many problems as it solves.

IMO protocols should be the first tool considered when dynamic polymorphism is necessary.

Making final the default for classes and methods would provide a subtle (or maybe not so subtle) hint in this direction.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I know the Swift team at Apple put a lot of thought into the defaults in Swift.  I agree with most of them.  Enabling subclassing and overriding by default is the one case where I think a significant mistake was made.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Our current intent is that public subclassing and overriding will be locked down by default, but internal subclassing and overriding will not be.  I believe that this strikes the right balance, and moreover that it is consistent with the general language approach to code evolution, which is to promote “consequence-free” rapid development by:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  (1) avoiding artificial bookkeeping obstacles while you’re hacking up the initial implementation of a module, but<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  (2) not letting that initial implementation make implicit source and binary compatibility promises to code outside of the module and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  (3) providing good language tools for incrementally building those initial prototype interfaces into stronger internal abstractions.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; All the hard limitations in the defaults are tied to the module boundary because we assume that it’s straightforward to fix any problems within the module if/when you decided you made a mistake earlier.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; So, okay, a class is subclassable by default, and it wasn’t really designed for that, and now there are subclasses in the module which are causing problems.  As long as nobody&#39;s changed the default (which they could have done carelessly in either case, but are much less likely to do if it’s only necessary to make an external subclass), all of those subclasses will still be within the module, and you still have free rein to correct that initial design mistake.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; John.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -- <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Javier Soto  _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151220/8911c1dd/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4fe988326eed161b989d0c5521cb105?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>Jordan Rose</string> &lt;jordan_rose at apple.com&gt;<p>December 21, 2015 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>Okay, so I probably shouldn&#39;t be putting this so bluntly, but the ship has already sailed on this. Supporting arbitrary code injection into someone else&#39;s framework is a non-goal for Swift, perhaps even an anti-goal.<br></p><p>- &#39;private&#39; and &#39;internal&#39; methods are not exposed outside of a library, so you can&#39;t call them, much less override them. Similar for &#39;private&#39; and &#39;internal&#39; classes: you cannot subclass them.<br></p><p>- Structs, enums, protocol extensions, and free functions are all not overrideable. (Similarly, neither are C functions or pretty much anything C++.)<br></p><p>- There&#39;s a difference between &quot;we&#39;re not going to optimize&quot; and &quot;we&#39;re not going to optimize now&quot;. Objective-C&#39;s &quot;everything uses objc_msgSend&quot; model is essentially unoptimizable. It&#39;s not that the developer can&#39;t work around that when performance is necessary; it&#39;s that the resulting code doesn&#39;t feel like Objective-C. Swift can do better, and even with its current semantics it does do better, for free. (And optimizations in frameworks are incredibly important. Where do you think your app spends most of its CPU time? I would guess for many many non-game apps, it&#39;s in framework code.)<br></p><p>- A major goal of Swift is safety. If you are writing a safe type built on unsafe constructs (like, say, Array), it is imperative that you have some control over your class invariants to guarantee safety. At the same time, your clients shouldn&#39;t have to know that you&#39;re built on unsafe constructs.<br></p><p>That last one is really the most important one. If you replace a method on someone else&#39;s class, you don&#39;t actually know what semantics they&#39;re relying on. Of course Apple code will have bugs in it. Trying to patch over these bugs in your own code is (1) obviously not an answer Apple would support, but also (2) fraught with peril, and (3) likely to break in the next OS release.<br></p><p>TLDR: It&#39;s already unsafe to do this with the existing set of Swift features.

As you say, there is hubris there in the suggestion “assume we’re right, and you can’t work around us.” I can see developer relations being inundated and unable to provide effective workarounds when the assumption is closed frameworks and finalised subclassing.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If they allow final in public frameworks, the default of “sealed” as mentioned by Jordan Rose makes sense. Closing an API further at a later date creates hell for those who subclass classes “hoping” that classes don’t become “finalised”. How do you handle such cases? It’s better than the alternatives.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; But that suggests that indeed there is a greater problem here. Final in end products makes sense. It provides clarity, and allows optimisations. But in frameworks? For those who rely on the frameworks, the ability to subclass to avoid a bug, or to add functionality, while unintended and potentially unsafe, is something we use to develop apps, and how we inspire development of the framework. I think this risks stifling creativity and blocking effective workarounds to bugs.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If we are to add finalisation to API for frameworks, it makes sense to do “Sealed” by default as discussed. But perhaps it needs to be examined if we really want this aggressive optimisation and restriction on frameworks at all.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On 20 Dec 2015, at 2:09 PM, Curt Clifton via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sure how many minuses I have to give, but I&#39;d give them all to this proposal.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Anyone who tries to ship products on release day of Apple&#39;s operating system updates spends most of August and September writing horrible hacks so that their users are insulated from OS bugs as much as possible. All software has bugs, frameworks included. Please don&#39;t take away our tools for working around those bugs. Making classes final by default assumes a level of perfection on the part of framework developers that is not achievable.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Yes, subclassing a class that wasn&#39;t designed to be subclassed has serious risks. Thoughtful developers sometimes take on those risks in order to serve their customers.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Frankly, I think having `final` in the language at all is a mistake. While I agree that we should prefer composition to inheritance*, declaring things final is hubris. The only reasonable use case I&#39;ve seen is for optimization, but that smacks of developers serving the compiler rather than the converse.

It&#39;s not that the developer can&#39;t work around that when performance is necessary; it&#39;s that the resulting code doesn&#39;t feel like Objective-C.

Where do you think your app spends most of its CPU time? I would guess for many many non-game apps, it&#39;s in framework code.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - A major goal of Swift is safety. If you are writing a safe type built on unsafe constructs (like, say, Array), it is imperative that you have some control over your class invariants to guarantee safety. At the same time, your clients shouldn&#39;t have to know that you&#39;re built on unsafe constructs.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That last one is really the most important one.

Sorry about that. That having been said:<br></p><p>There is a really big design difference between a library like Swift’s stdlib or Foundation, which have fairly straightforward interfaces and simple program flow in and out. (In both of these cases you generally call in, and any calls out to application code are explicit and mostly short-lived closures.) AppKit or UIKit, on the other hand, are incredibly porous and have quite complicated program flow between the framework and the application code. The framework design is more like a skeleton upon which the application code hangs, and which in turns moves the kit objects about, rather than a self-contained system with a lot of invariants. <br></p><p>I can’t prove any causation, but I would certainly argue that the dynamic nature and possible overridability of even things that Apple doesn’t specifically intend to allow overriding is one of the primary reasons why AppKit has survived for 20+ years and spawned arguably the most successful application framework in history in UIKit. On the other hand, efficiency and safety have rarely been major issues.<br></p><p>TLDR: I don’t think using the design trade-offs of Array (which is, after all, a value type and can’t be subclassed anyway) inside stdlib, can be very usefully broadened to apply to reference types in application frameworks. <br></p><p>	- Greg<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151221/331d3248/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7759950c169ff7ec3ad7b0d858402fb2?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>Roopesh Chander</string> &lt;roop at roopc.net&gt;<p>December 22, 2015 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; the dynamic nature and possible overridability of even things that Apple<br>doesn’t<br>&gt; specifically intend to allow overriding is one of the primary reasons why<br>AppKit has<br>&gt; survived for 20+ years and spawned arguably the most successful<br>application<br>&gt; framework in history in UIKit.<br></p><p>Aren&#39;t we mixing up two different issues here? &quot;Having a default final for<br>Swift classes&quot; should be treated as a separate issue from &quot;Apple frameworks<br>should stay overridable&quot;.<br></p><p>They are different issues because:<br></p><p> (a) Even if final was not the default, any framework vendor can mark its<br>classes final.

I<br>&gt;&gt; really don&#39;t understand how this would conflict with &quot;consequence-free&quot;<br>&gt;&gt; rapid development.  It is a good thing to require people to stop and think<br>&gt;&gt; before using inheritance.  Often there is a more appropriate alternative.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The assumption that it is straightforward to fix problems within a module<br>&gt;&gt; if you later decide you made a mistake is true in some respects but not in<br>&gt;&gt; others.  It is not uncommon for apps to be monolithic rather than being<br>&gt;&gt; well factored into separate modules, with many developers contributing and<br>&gt;&gt; the team changing over time.  While this is not ideal it is reality.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; When you have the full source it is certainly *possible* to solve any<br>&gt;&gt; problem but it is often not straightforward at all.  Here is an example of<br>&gt;&gt; a real-work scenario app developers might walk into:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 1) A class is developed without subclassing in mind by one developer.<br>&gt;&gt; 2) After the original developer is gone another developer adds some<br>&gt;&gt; subclasses without stopping to think about whether the original developer<br>&gt;&gt; designed for subclassing, thereby introducing subtle bugs into the app.<br>&gt;&gt; 3) After the second developer is gone the bugs are discovered, but by<br>&gt;&gt; this time there are nontrivial dependencies on the subclasses.<br>&gt;&gt; 4) A third developer who probably has little or no context for the<br>&gt;&gt; decisions made by previous developers is tasked with fixing the bugs.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; This can be quite a knot to untangle, especially if there are problems<br>&gt;&gt; modifying the superclass to properly support the subclasses (maybe this<br>&gt;&gt; breaks the contract the superclass has with its original clients).<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; It may have been possible to avoid the whole mess if the second developer<br>&gt;&gt; was required to add &#39;inheritable&#39; and &#39;overrideable&#39; keywords or similar.<br>&gt;&gt; They are already required to revisit the source of it while adding the<br>&gt;&gt; keywords which may lead to consideration of whether the implementation is<br>&gt;&gt; sufficient to support inheritance in their currently intended manner.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Implementation inheritance is a blunt tool that often leads to<br>&gt;&gt; unanticipated problems.  IMO a modern language should steer developers away<br>&gt;&gt; from it and strive to reduce the cases where it is necessary or more<br>&gt;&gt; convenient.  Making final the default would help to do this.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Supporting sealed classes and methods that can only be subclassed or<br>&gt;&gt; overridden within the same module is not in conflict with final by<br>&gt;&gt; default.  Both are good ideas IMO and I would like to see both in Swift.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I hope the core team is willing to revisit this decision with community<br>&gt;&gt; input.

Either way you may have design issues go<br>&gt;&gt; unnoticed until someone needs to subclass to get the behavior they want. So<br>&gt;&gt; when you reach that point, should the system error on the side of rigid<br>&gt;&gt; safety or dangerous flexibility?<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is a nice summary of the tradeoff.  I strongly prefer safety<br>&gt;&gt; myself and I believe the preference for safety fits well with the overall<br>&gt;&gt; direction of Swift.  If a library author discovers a design oversight and<br>&gt;&gt; later decides they should have allowed for additional flexibility it is<br>&gt;&gt; straightforward to allow for this without breaking existing client code.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Many of the examples cited in argument against final by default have<br>&gt;&gt; to do with working around library or framework bugs.  I understand the<br>&gt;&gt; motivation to preserve this flexibility bur don&#39;t believe bug workarounds<br>&gt;&gt; are a good way to make language design decisions. I also believe use of<br>&gt;&gt; subclasses and overrides in ways the library author may not have intended<br>&gt;&gt; to is a fragile technique that is likely to eventually cause as many<br>&gt;&gt; problems as it solves.  I have been programming a long time and have never<br>&gt;&gt; run into a case where this technique was the only way or even the best way<br>&gt;&gt; to accomplish the task at hand.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One additional motivation for making final the default that has not<br>&gt;&gt; been discussed yet is the drive towards making Swift a protocol oriented<br>&gt;&gt; language.  IMO protocols should be the first tool considered when dynamic<br>&gt;&gt; polymorphism is necessary.  Inheritance should be reserved for cases where<br>&gt;&gt; other approaches won&#39;t work (and we should seek to reduce the number of<br>&gt;&gt; problems where that is the case).  Making final the default for classes and<br>&gt;&gt; methods would provide a subtle (or maybe not so subtle) hint in this<br>&gt;&gt; direction.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I know the Swift team at Apple put a lot of thought into the defaults<br>&gt;&gt; in Swift.  I agree with most of them.  Enabling subclassing and overriding<br>&gt;&gt; by default is the one case where I think a significant mistake was made.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; Our current intent is that public subclassing and overriding will be<br>&gt;&gt; locked down by default, but internal subclassing and overriding will not<br>&gt;&gt; be.  I believe that this strikes the right balance, and moreover that it is<br>&gt;&gt; consistent with the general language approach to code evolution, which is<br>&gt;&gt; to promote “consequence-free” rapid development by:<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;  (1) avoiding artificial bookkeeping obstacles while you’re hacking up<br>&gt;&gt; the initial implementation of a module, but<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;  (2) not letting that initial implementation make implicit source and<br>&gt;&gt; binary compatibility promises to code outside of the module and<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;  (3) providing good language tools for incrementally building those<br>&gt;&gt; initial prototype interfaces into stronger internal abstractions.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; All the hard limitations in the defaults are tied to the module<br>&gt;&gt; boundary because we assume that it’s straightforward to fix any problems<br>&gt;&gt; within the module if/when you decided you made a mistake earlier.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; So, okay, a class is subclassable by default, and it wasn’t really<br>&gt;&gt; designed for that, and now there are subclasses in the module which are<br>&gt;&gt; causing problems.  As long as nobody&#39;s changed the default (which they<br>&gt;&gt; could have done carelessly in either case, but are much less likely to do<br>&gt;&gt; if it’s only necessary to make an external subclass), all of those<br>&gt;&gt; subclasses will still be within the module, and you still have free rein to<br>&gt;&gt; correct that initial design mistake.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; John.<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; --<br>&gt; Javier Soto  _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151220/c4822c16/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/831ba6eb600af4a6587f263373921bb2?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>Tino Heth</string> &lt;2th at gmx.de&gt;<p>December 20, 2015 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Frankly, I think having `final` in the language at all is a mistake.

I really don&#39;t understand how this would conflict with &quot;consequence-free&quot; rapid development.  It is a good thing to require people to stop and think before using inheritance.  Often there is a more appropriate alternative.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The assumption that it is straightforward to fix problems within a module if you later decide you made a mistake is true in some respects but not in others.  It is not uncommon for apps to be monolithic rather than being well factored into separate modules, with many developers contributing and the team changing over time.  While this is not ideal it is reality.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; When you have the full source it is certainly *possible* to solve any problem but it is often not straightforward at all.  Here is an example of a real-work scenario app developers might walk into:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1) A class is developed without subclassing in mind by one developer.<br>&gt; 2) After the original developer is gone another developer adds some subclasses without stopping to think about whether the original developer designed for subclassing, thereby introducing subtle bugs into the app.<br>&gt; 3) After the second developer is gone the bugs are discovered, but by this time there are nontrivial dependencies on the subclasses.<br>&gt; 4) A third developer who probably has little or no context for the decisions made by previous developers is tasked with fixing the bugs.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This can be quite a knot to untangle, especially if there are problems modifying the superclass to properly support the subclasses (maybe this breaks the contract the superclass has with its original clients).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It may have been possible to avoid the whole mess if the second developer was required to add &#39;inheritable&#39; and &#39;overrideable&#39; keywords or similar.  They are already required to revisit the source of it while adding the keywords which may lead to consideration of whether the implementation is sufficient to support inheritance in their currently intended manner.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Implementation inheritance is a blunt tool that often leads to unanticipated problems.  IMO a modern language should steer developers away from it and strive to reduce the cases where it is necessary or more convenient.  Making final the default would help to do this.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Supporting sealed classes and methods that can only be subclassed or overridden within the same module is not in conflict with final by default.  Both are good ideas IMO and I would like to see both in Swift.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I hope the core team is willing to revisit this decision with community input.  If not I will let it go, although I doubt I will ever agree with the current decision.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Matthew<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Sent from my iPad<br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Dec 7, 2015, at 10:30 PM, John McCall &lt;rjmccall at apple.com &lt;mailto:rjmccall at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; On Dec 7, 2015, at 7:18 PM, Matthew Johnson via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Defaults of public sealed/final classes and final methods on a class by default are a tougher call.

As long as nobody&#39;s changed the default (which they could have done carelessly in either case, but are much less likely to do if it’s only necessary to make an external subclass), all of those subclasses will still be within the module, and you still have free rein to correct that initial design mistake.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I think John summarized my position very well, so of course I&#39;m going to come in here and add more stuff. :-)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In working on the design for library evolution support (&quot;resilience&quot;), we&#39;ve come across a number of cases of &quot;should a library author be able to change this when they release v2 of their library?&quot; Many times, the answer is it&#39;s possible to do something in one direction, but not at all safe to go the other way. For example, you can always add public methods to a class, but you can&#39;t remove public methods because you don&#39;t know who&#39;s calling them. You can mark them deprecated, but that doesn&#39;t help with any client apps that have already been compiled and shipped.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; One of the things that came up was &quot;can you add &#39;final&#39; to a class?&quot; And of course you can&#39;t, because you don&#39;t know who may have already subclassed it. That&#39;s very unfortunate for a library author who simply forgot to add &#39;final&#39; when they were first writing the class.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The interesting thing about this is that the &quot;error of omission&quot;—of failing to think about whether a class should be final—is worse than the alternative. Ignoring optimizations for a minute, a class that starts out &#39;final&#39; can certainly become non-final later; it doesn&#39;t change how the class is currently used.* For a lot of library evolution questions, this is the preferred answer: the default should be safe, and the designer of the class can choose to be more aggressive later.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This is also the guiding principle behind the behavior of &#39;public&#39;. A number of people have asked for members of a public struct to implicitly be made public. But here again the &quot;error of omission&quot; is problematic: a helper function you add for your own use may now be depended on by client apps far and wide, just because you forgot to customize the access control. So Swift says you should explicitly consider the public interface of every type.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Why &#39;sealed&#39; instead of &#39;final&#39; as the default? Because inheritance is useful, and within your own code having to opt into it starts to feel like unnecessary clutter. This is a trade-off, just like defaulting to &#39;internal&#39; over &#39;private&#39;, but it&#39;s one that keeps life easy for a single developer with a single module: their app. (And the compiler can still do useful things with non-final classes if it can see the entire class hierarchy.) Additionally, limiting inheritance to the current file (a la &#39;private&#39;) is also potentially useful.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This direction separates &quot;limiting inheritance/overrides&quot; from &quot;has no subclasses/overrides&quot;. The former is about defining the limits of your API; the latter is a promise that can be used for performance. I think that&#39;s a good thing.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Jordan<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * Even without optimizations a &#39;final&#39; class cannot safely drop the &#39;final&#39;. If a class is &#39;final&#39;, it may have additional &#39;required&#39; initializers added in extensions.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151220/fc6637b4/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc3a9ea0c6c870343d9acb4ac3059cdc?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>Matthew Johnson</string> &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt;<p>December 21, 2015 at 08:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>As I mentioned earlier, Erica Sadun was kind enough to add a poll about this topic to her recent blog post (Naturally final classes in Swift — Erica Sadun &lt;http://ericasadun.com/2015/12/18/naturally-final-classes-in-swift/&gt;).  There have been 70 respondents so far: https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-FVQPXQ3J/ &lt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-FVQPXQ3J/&gt;.  This is obviously not a scientific sample and is not too large, but it is probably enough to give some sense of how inheritance is used by app developers as well as their opinions about final as default.<br></p><p>Here are some of the results I find especially worth noting:<br></p><p>&quot;What percent of the classes you write are subclasses of classes other than Apple provided framework or open source library classes?”<br></p><p>66.67% indicate such subclasses only comprise 0-20% of the classes they write.<br>14.49% indicate such subclasses comprise 20-40% of the classes they write.<br></p><p>We also asked the inverse question &quot;What percent of the classes you write are written with the intent that you will subclass them elsewhere in your app?”<br></p><p>80.00% indicate that only 0-20% of the classes they write are intended to be superclasses  (subclassed elsewhere in the app).<br>7.14% indicate that 20-40% of the classes they write are intended to be superclasses (subclassed elsewhere in the app).<br></p><p>72.73% believe that final should be the default behavior.<br></p><p>48.48% prefer an `inheritable` keyword when inheritance is intended.  An additional 15.15% prefer a `nonfinal` keyword for this behavior.  64.15% prefer one of the two.  Only 36.36% prefer the current state of using `final`.<br></p><p>Obviously there are slight differences between questions that are effectively asking the same thing.  My guess is that this can be attributed to misunderstanding of the question in some cases.  <br></p><p>The data points to a strong trend.  Most classes written by respondents at the app level are not intended to be subclassed.  Aligning with this trend in frequency, most of the respondents would prefer final to be the default behavior.<br></p><p>I have seen two arguments consistently emerge against making final the default.  <br></p><p>The first of those arguments is coming from a vocal group of app developers (possibly a vocal minority if the survey is any indication) who want to be able to subclass Apple frameworks to work around bugs.  This argument is effectively making a moot point if we are already moving towards a `sealed` default.  In any case, many of the framework classes are intended to be subclassed by developers and will be marked `inheritable` or similar allowing this to continue.  Furthermore, as Jordan noted it isn’t really safe to make a class `final` retroactively.  Because of this it is unlikely that current framework classes will be impacted by a change to `sealed` or `final` in the near term.  This is likely to be a long-term transition.<br></p><p>The other argument is that inheritance is a useful feature and requiring people to opt-in to it in their own code is going to be annoying.  I find this argument somewhat surprising in a language that values safety and clarity.  Safe use of inheritance requires thoughtful design.  Allowing inheritance by default is less safe.  It is also less clear because the code offers no indication of whether the author designed for inheritance or not.  This fact is recognized in &quot;error of omission” arguments for making `sealed` the default.  It applies no less to code within our own app or module.  Problems may be easier to fix in that case, but why not make them easier to avoid in the first place?<br></p><p>The comparison with access control is not a great one IMO, especially if the survey data is indicative of wider patterns.  I haven’t done any analysis, but my instinct is that internal is the correct access level more often  than private.  A reasonable debate could probably be held as to whether it is more problematic to access members that should be private elsewhere in the same module or to inherit from a class that wasn’t really designed for subclassing.  That said, my experience and intuition says inheritance is quite a bit more problematic.<br></p><p>IMHO reducing annoyance and bookkeeping in what is arguably a significant minority of cases is a pretty weak argument for sacrificing what I strongly believe is increased clarity and safety.  The argument is even weaker if a majority of developers would prefer the safety and clarity of making `final` the default.  Ironically, a default of `final` is actually less annoying and less bookkeeping for developers desire clarity in their code enough to add `final` where that is actually the intent if most of the classes they write are indeed leaves of the inheritance hierarchy. <br></p><p>It is my hope that the data gathered in the survey will have some influence on this discussion.  At a minimum I hope it encourages us to look deeper at this issue and gather additional data to find out whether the pattern identified by the survey holds more broadly.  <br></p><p>Matthew<br></p><p><br></p><p>&gt; On Dec 19, 2015, at 9:21 PM, Jordan Rose via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Dec 7, 2015, at 20:30 , John McCall via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Dec 7, 2015, at 7:18 PM, Matthew Johnson via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Defaults of public sealed/final classes and final methods on a class by default are a tougher call. Either way you may have design issues go unnoticed until someone needs to subclass to get the behavior they want. So when you reach that point, should the system error on the side of rigid safety or dangerous flexibility?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a nice summary of the tradeoff.  I strongly prefer safety myself and I believe the preference for safety fits well with the overall direction of Swift.  If a library author discovers a design oversight and later decides they should have allowed for additional flexibility it is straightforward to allow for this without breaking existing client code.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Many of the examples cited in argument against final by default have to do with working around library or framework bugs.  I understand the motivation to preserve this flexibility bur don&#39;t believe bug workarounds are a good way to make language design decisions. I also believe use of subclasses and overrides in ways the library author may not have intended to is a fragile technique that is likely to eventually cause as many problems as it solves.  I have been programming a long time and have never run into a case where this technique was the only way or even the best way to accomplish the task at hand.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; One additional motivation for making final the default that has not been discussed yet is the drive towards making Swift a protocol oriented language.  IMO protocols should be the first tool considered when dynamic polymorphism is necessary.  Inheritance should be reserved for cases where other approaches won&#39;t work (and we should seek to reduce the number of problems where that is the case).  Making final the default for classes and methods would provide a subtle (or maybe not so subtle) hint in this direction.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I know the Swift team at Apple put a lot of thought into the defaults in Swift.

I make no claims as to sound conclusions that can be drawn from the poll.  It is absolutely anecdotal.  I called out the unscientific nature of the poll right from the start.  You could be right about bias towards those who want final to be the default, but there are equally passionate people on the other side of this debate who may be motivated to respond as well.  It’s impossible to tell.<br></p><p>My conclusion states: &quot;at a minimum I hope it encourages us to look deeper at this issue and gather additional data to find out whether the pattern identified by the survey holds more broadly.”  I don’t go any further than that.  But I do think it is wise to do this.  A lot of people are moving away from heavy reliance on inheritance in their Swift code.  Anecdotal data confirming this seems to be enough to warrant a closer look IMO.<br></p><p>You are correct that we can use value types in many cases and value types do not allow inheritance.  However, any Swift application is necessarily going to have a lot of classes as the Cocoa frameworks require apps to subclass framework classes in many instances.  Even when we are not required to subclass a framework class they often require our types to be a class, for example when we are providing a delegate to a Cocoa class.  These requirements of the frameworks result in a lot of classes in Swift applications that are not ever intended to be subclassed.<br></p><p>You ask why I don’t think `inheritable` should be the default.  I believe I have addressed that by making a case that it is less clear and less safe as a default.  Swift prioritizes safety and clarity so I believe the defaults should be influenced by those priorities.  If you have specific criticisms of the argument I presented I would like to know what they are.  Specifically, if you believe `inheritable` is a safer or more clear default I am very curious to hear why you believe that.<br></p><p>Thanks,<br>Matthew<br></p><p><br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151221/75d6a0f2/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/831ba6eb600af4a6587f263373921bb2?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>Tino Heth</string> &lt;2th at gmx.de&gt;<p>December 21, 2015 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>oh, cool - discussion ;-)<br></p><p>&gt; However, any Swift application is necessarily going to have a lot of classes as the Cocoa frameworks require apps to subclass framework classes in many instances.

So when you reach that point, should the system<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; error on the side of rigid safety or dangerous flexibility?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a nice summary of the tradeoff.  I strongly prefer safety<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; myself and I believe the preference for safety fits well with the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; overall direction of Swift.  If a library author discovers a design<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; oversight and later decides they should have allowed for additional<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; flexibility it is straightforward to allow for this without breaking<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; existing client code.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Many of the examples cited in argument against final by default have<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; to do with working around library or framework bugs.  I understand<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; the motivation to preserve this flexibility bur don&#39;t believe bug<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; workarounds are a good way to make language design decisions. I also<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; believe use of subclasses and overrides in ways the library author<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; may not have intended to is a fragile technique that is likely to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; eventually cause as many problems as it solves.  I have been<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; programming a long time and have never run into a case where this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; technique was the only way or even the best way to accomplish the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; task at hand.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; One additional motivation for making final the default that has not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; been discussed yet is the drive towards making Swift a protocol<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; oriented language.  IMO protocols should be the first tool<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; considered when dynamic polymorphism is necessary.  Inheritance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; should be reserved for cases where other approaches won&#39;t work (and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; we should seek to reduce the number of problems where that is the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; case).  Making final the default for classes and methods would<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; provide a subtle (or maybe not so subtle) hint in this direction.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I know the Swift team at Apple put a lot of thought into the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; defaults in Swift.  I agree with most of them. Enabling subclassing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; and overriding by default is the one case where I think a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; significant mistake was made.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Our current intent is that public subclassing and overriding will<br>&gt;&gt; be locked down by default, but internal subclassing and overriding<br>&gt;&gt; will not be.  I believe that this strikes the right balance, and<br>&gt;&gt; moreover that it is consistent with the general language approach<br>&gt;&gt; to code evolution, which is to promote “consequence-free” rapid<br>&gt;&gt; development by:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; (1) avoiding artificial bookkeeping obstacles while you’re hacking up<br>&gt;&gt; the initial implementation of a module, but<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; (2) not letting that initial implementation make implicit source and<br>&gt;&gt; binary compatibility promises to code outside of the module and<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; (3) providing good language tools for incrementally building those<br>&gt;&gt; initial prototype interfaces into stronger internal abstractions.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; All the hard limitations in the defaults are tied to the module<br>&gt;&gt; boundary because we assume that it’s straightforward to fix any<br>&gt;&gt; problems within the module if/when you decided you made a mistake<br>&gt;&gt; earlier.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; So, okay, a class is subclassable by default, and it wasn’t really<br>&gt;&gt; designed for that, and now there are subclasses in the module which<br>&gt;&gt; are causing problems.  As long as nobody&#39;s changed the default (which<br>&gt;&gt; they could have done carelessly in either case, but are much less<br>&gt;&gt; likely to do if it’s only necessary to make an external subclass),<br>&gt;&gt; all of those subclasses will still be within the module, and you<br>&gt;&gt; still have free rein to correct that initial design mistake.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I think John summarized my position very well, so of course I&#39;m going<br>&gt; to come in here and add more stuff. :-)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In working on the design for library evolution support (&quot;resilience&quot;),<br>&gt; we&#39;ve come across a number of cases of &quot;should a library author be<br>&gt; able to change this when they release v2 of their library?&quot; Many<br>&gt; times, the answer is it&#39;s *possible* to do something in one direction,<br>&gt; but not at all safe to go the other way. For example, you can always<br>&gt; add public methods to a class, but you can&#39;t *remove* public methods<br>&gt; because you don&#39;t know who&#39;s calling them. You can mark them<br>&gt; deprecated, but that doesn&#39;t help with any client apps that have<br>&gt; already been compiled and shipped.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; One of the things that came up was &quot;can you add &#39;final&#39; to a class?&quot;<br>&gt; And of course you can&#39;t, because you don&#39;t know who may have already<br>&gt; subclassed it. That&#39;s very unfortunate for a library author who simply<br>&gt; forgot to add &#39;final&#39; when they were first writing the class.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The interesting thing about this is that the &quot;error of omission&quot;—of<br>&gt; failing to think about whether a class should be final—is worse than<br>&gt; the alternative. Ignoring optimizations for a minute, a class that<br>&gt; *starts out* &#39;final&#39; can certainly become non-final later; it doesn&#39;t<br>&gt; change how the class is currently used.* For a lot of library<br>&gt; evolution questions, this is the preferred answer: *the default should<br>&gt; be safe,* and the designer of the class can choose to be more<br>&gt; aggressive later.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This is also the guiding principle behind the behavior of &#39;public&#39;. A<br>&gt; number of people have asked for members of a public struct to<br>&gt; implicitly be made public. But here again the &quot;error of omission&quot; is<br>&gt; problematic: a helper function you add for your own use may now be<br>&gt; depended on by client apps far and wide, just because you forgot to<br>&gt; customize the access control. So Swift says you should explicitly<br>&gt; consider the public interface of every type.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Why &#39;sealed&#39; instead of &#39;final&#39; as the default? Because inheritance is<br>&gt; useful, and within your *own* code having to opt into it starts to<br>&gt; feel like unnecessary clutter. This is a trade-off, just like<br>&gt; defaulting to &#39;internal&#39; over &#39;private&#39;, but it&#39;s one that keeps life<br>&gt; easy for a single developer with a single module: their app. (And the<br>&gt; compiler can still do useful things with non-final classes if it can<br>&gt; see the entire class hierarchy.) Additionally, limiting inheritance to<br>&gt; the *current* file (a la &#39;private&#39;) is also potentially useful.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This direction separates &quot;limiting inheritance/overrides&quot; from &quot;has no<br>&gt; subclasses/overrides&quot;. The former is about defining the limits of your<br>&gt; API; the latter is a promise that can be used for performance. I think<br>&gt; that&#39;s a good thing.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Jordan<br>&gt;<br>&gt; * Even without optimizations a &#39;final&#39; class cannot safely drop the<br>&gt;   &#39;final&#39;. If a class is &#39;final&#39;, it may have additional &#39;required&#39;<br>&gt;   initializers added in extensions.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151221/1bca4405/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2861bfeb71de9de58206bb6ae750bc2f?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>ilya</string> &lt;ilya.nikokoshev at gmail.com&gt;<p>December  8, 2015 at 07:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>If you design a module and want to create a public interface for an object<br>which isn&#39;t supposed to be subclassed, wouldn&#39;t exposing an opaque<br>constructor function and a protocol be a more expressive choice (compared<br>to exposing a sealed class)?<br></p><p>On Tue, Dec 8, 2015 at 04:13 David Waite via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; A typical class intermingle several implicit concepts in their design:<br>&gt; - The public interface for external modules using the class<br>&gt; - The internal workings and state of the implementation<br>&gt; - The interface describing what behavior can and can’t be customized<br>&gt; safely by subclasses, and how<br>&gt; - Possibly an interface for privileged code (“internal” in Swift) to not<br>&gt; expose publicly<br>&gt;<br>&gt; public/private/internal, as well as final and the proposed sealed are<br>&gt; rough tools to help in making these more explicit.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What I’m getting at is that in the absence of a completely well-designed<br>&gt; class which takes all of these into account, the defaults affect what a<br>&gt; typical class looks like.<br>&gt; - A choice of internal by default means that the class may accidentally<br>&gt; not be exposed outside the module for public use, while a public default<br>&gt; means that implementation details may be exposed accidentally<br>&gt; - A sealed class/final method by default means that a class may not be<br>&gt; able to be customized in behavior, making the whole framework less useful.<br>&gt; Non sealed by default means that classes can be customized, possibly<br>&gt; without instruction in ways that are unsafe<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Internal by default seems like a clear cut win - compiler errors or an<br>&gt; example program will show classes which were meant to be exposed but were<br>&gt; not.

The only example I know of kind-of this is C++, where<br>methods have to be specified &quot;virtual&quot; (even though that doesn&#39;t have quite<br>the same semantics).<br>I dislike the term &quot;virtual&quot; because it conveys implementation details,<br>rather than developer intention. Ideally the keywords would communicate &quot;I<br>meant for this class to be subclassable, and these are the methods that you<br>can / must override &quot;, and users of Swift shouldn&#39;t have to know what a<br>v-table is.<br></p><p>I don&#39;t have great ideas for keywords.

This is a tough question, and I find myself torn. I’m sympathetic to both lines of argument.<br></p><p>It’s not entirely true that “you can never take back” overridability — you can make a breaking API change with a new major version, of course — but it’s a compelling point nonetheless. One default is clearly safer than the other, at least for the library author. “Safe by default” is indeed the Swift MO. (Well, except for array subscripting. And any public API involving tuples, for which any change, even type widening, is a breaking change. And….OK, it’s not absolute, but “safe by default” is the MO 95% of the time.) “Final by default” just seems more Swift-like to me.<br></p><p>Despite that, Joe, I have to agree with Brent on his central point: the perspective that comes from spending a lot of time _writing_ libraries is very different from one who spend more time _using_ them. Yes, UIKit is not going to be rewritten in Swift anytime soon, but Brent is rightly imagining a future where the Swift way is The Way.<br></p><p>I weigh the safety argument against the many long hours I’ve spent beating my head against library behaviors, wishing I could read UIKit’s source code, wishing I could tweak that one little thing that I can’t control, and being grateful for the dubious workaround that saves the day — yes, even when a subsequent OS update breaks it. I know what I’m getting into when I solve a problem with a hack, and if the hack ships, it’s only because I weighed the risks and benefits. We app developers rely on swizzling, dubious subclassing, and (especially) undocumented behavior far more often than any of us would like. It is just part of the reality of making things ship — and an important part of the success of Apple’s app ecosystem.<br></p><p>This debate reminds me of something that often happens when a humans-and-paper process moves to software. When the software starts rigorously enforcing all the rules the humans were theoretically following all along, and it turns out that quite a lot of in-the-moment nuanced human judgement was crucial to making everything work. With nuance removed, things fall apart — and instead of things at last achieving the rigor that seemed so desirable in theory, the process has to explicitly loosen. (At the local coffee shop, a new iPad-based POS system suddenly made it an “uh let me get the manager” moment when I want to get the off-menu half-sized oatmeal I’ve always got for my toddler.)<br></p><p>I’m not totally opposed to final by default. Joe’s arguments sway me in principle. In practice, if Swift does indeed moves us toward “less wiggle room, less hackable” by default, then that wiggle room _will_ have to come from somewhere else: perhaps more open sourcing and more forking, or faster turnaround on fixes from library authors, or a larger portion of time spent by library authors explicitly exposing and documenting customization points. The new effort involved for library authors is nothing to sneeze at.<br></p><p>Cheers,<br></p><p>Paul<br></p><p><br>&gt; On Dec 22, 2015, at 9:46 AM, Joe Groff via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I think a lot of people in this thread are conflating &quot;final by default&quot; or &quot;sealed by default&quot; with &quot;sealed everywhere&quot;.

The proposals that every single method should be explicitly marked as overridable are even worse; frankly, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to use Swift if you forced me to put a `virtual` keyword on every declaration.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I worry that the team&#39;s use of Swift to build the standard library, and their close association with teams building OS frameworks, is biasing the language a little bit. I think that, in all likelihood, most Swift code is in individual applications, and most libraries are not published outside of a single team. If I&#39;m right, then most Swift code will probably be quite tolerant of small but technically &quot;breaking&quot; ABI changes, such as making a class `final`, or (as mentioned in another thread) making a closure `@noescape`.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That won&#39;t be true of published library code, of course. But published library code is a small minority of the Swift code people will write, and it already will require greater scrutiny and more careful design. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; There is already a good opportunity to reflect on whether or not an API should be `final`.

We app developers rely on swizzling, dubious subclassing, and (especially) undocumented behavior far more often than any of us would like. It is just part of the reality of making things ship — and an important part of the success of Apple’s app ecosystem.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This debate reminds me of something that often happens when a humans-and-paper process moves to software. When the software starts rigorously enforcing all the rules the humans were theoretically following all along, and it turns out that quite a lot of in-the-moment nuanced human judgement was crucial to making everything work. With nuance removed, things fall apart — and instead of things at last achieving the rigor that seemed so desirable in theory, the process has to explicitly loosen. (At the local coffee shop, a new iPad-based POS system suddenly made it an “uh let me get the manager” moment when I want to get the off-menu half-sized oatmeal I’ve always got for my toddler.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I’m not totally opposed to final by default. Joe’s arguments sway me in principle. In practice, if Swift does indeed moves us toward “less wiggle room, less hackable” by default, then that wiggle room _will_ have to come from somewhere else: perhaps more open sourcing and more forking, or faster turnaround on fixes from library authors, or a larger portion of time spent by library authors explicitly exposing and documenting customization points. The new effort involved for library authors is nothing to sneeze at.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Paul<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Dec 22, 2015, at 9:46 AM, Joe Groff via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think a lot of people in this thread are conflating &quot;final by default&quot; or &quot;sealed by default&quot; with &quot;sealed everywhere&quot;. No matter what the default is, the frameworks aren&#39;t going to suddenly rewrite themselves in Swift with final everything; Objective-C will still be what it is. Furthermore, we&#39;re only talking about language defaults; we&#39;re not taking away the ability for frameworks to make their classes publicly subclassable or dynamically overrideable. That&#39;s a policy decision for framework authors to make. The goal of &quot;sealed by default&quot; is to make sure the language doesn&#39;t make promises on the developer&#39;s behalf that they weren&#39;t ready to keep. ObjC&#39;s flexibility is valuable, and Apple definitely takes advantage of it internally all over place; Apple also has an army of compatibility engineers to make sure framework changes work well with existing software. Not every developer can afford that maintenance burden/flexibility tradeoff, though, so that flexibility is something you ought to opt in to. You can always safely add public subclassability and dynamic overrideability in new framework versions, but you can never take them back.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Dec 22, 2015, at 12:31 AM, Brent Royal-Gordon via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just imagine going through UIKit and marking every class inheritable *by hand*—no cheating with a script—and you&#39;ll have some idea of the additional burden you&#39;ll be imposing on developers as they write their code. The proposals that every single method should be explicitly marked as overridable are even worse; frankly, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to use Swift if you forced me to put a `virtual` keyword on every declaration.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I worry that the team&#39;s use of Swift to build the standard library, and their close association with teams building OS frameworks, is biasing the language a little bit. I think that, in all likelihood, most Swift code is in individual applications, and most libraries are not published outside of a single team. If I&#39;m right, then most Swift code will probably be quite tolerant of small but technically &quot;breaking&quot; ABI changes, such as making a class `final`, or (as mentioned in another thread) making a closure `@noescape`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That won&#39;t be true of published library code, of course. But published library code is a small minority of the Swift code people will write, and it already will require greater scrutiny and more careful design. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is already a good opportunity to reflect on whether or not an API should be `final`. It&#39;s when you put the `public` keyword on it. I think programmers will have a better, easier time writing their code if, in this case, we put a little bit of trust in them, rather than erecting yet another hoop they must jump through.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps we could even provide a &quot;strict interfaces&quot; mode that published frameworks can turn on, which would require you to declare the heritability of every class and member. But even that may not be a good idea, because I also suspect that, in the field, most published libraries probably have to be extended in ways the library&#39;s author did not expect or anticipate. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This means doing some dangerous overriding, yes. But a UI that breaks after an iOS upgrade is not nearly as dangerous to my business as a three-month delay while I reimplement half of UIKit because someone in Cupertino thought they knew what I need better than I do and turned off—or even worse, *left turned off without a single thought*—subclassing of UIBarButtonItem.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The bottom line is this: Your users like Swift&#39;s strictures when they&#39;re helpful. *This stricture is not helpful.* Library users don&#39;t accidentally subclass things, and with the `override` keyword in Swift, they don&#39;t accidentally override them either. And where it truly is important, for safety or for speed, to prevent subclassing, we already have `final`. Making it the default is less safety than suffering.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/831ba6eb600af4a6587f263373921bb2?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>Tino Heth</string> &lt;2th at gmx.de&gt;<p>December 22, 2015 at 09:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Whether the language has final-by-default/sealed-by-default doesn&#39;t really affect this in any way.

Which when we’re dealing with human developers, isn’t necessarily going to be the case.<br>&gt; <br></p><p>Please read the post I just sent regarding 3rd party frameworks and libraries and comment there if you disagree.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151223/a1fc28ec/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f822334c2f6ebeafd3a41cd44c82a62b?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>Andrey Tarantsov</string> &lt;andrey at tarantsov.com&gt;<p>December 24, 2015 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Isn&#39;t this proposal solving a problem that in practice doesn&#39;t exist or isn&#39;t common enough to be worth a language level fix?<br></p><p>Well I have a TextExpander macro that inserts &quot;// override point&quot; when I type ;overp.

Many classes in UIKit are designed to handle subclassing, but some classes are not designed to handle that, and are explicitly documented as saying that you shouldn&#39;t subclass them because they won&#39;t work right. Assuming a future in which UIKit is reimplemented in Swift, every class today that is not explicitly documented as saying &quot;don&#39;t subclass this&quot; would presumably be marked as inheritable. And the classes that say &quot;don&#39;t subclass this&quot; may very well be final/sealed, and that&#39;s perfectly OK because subclassing them doesn&#39;t work properly anyway.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Whether the language has final-by-default/sealed-by-default doesn&#39;t really affect this in any way. I guarantee you that once Apple starts putting Swift code in their frameworks, every single framework class Apple releases is going to make an explicit decision about being final/sealed vs inheritable, and the language defaults won&#39;t affect that one bit.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The only thing that final-by-default/sealed-by-default is going to affect is third-party code that is released without carefully thinking about this issue. And really, any code that is released that doesn&#39;t explicitly think about this issue is likely to have issues with subclassing anyway (because the developer didn&#39;t give any thought to whether subclasses would be allowed and likely made assumptions in various places that it wouldn&#39;t, even if they didn&#39;t consciously think about it). That said, I do think it&#39;s a really good idea for anyone releasing libraries to make an explicit decision about whether the class should be final/sealed or inheritable.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; One benefit I haven&#39;t seen mentioned about this proposal is it makes it obvious when the author has made an explicit decision. Today there&#39;s no keyword for inheritable, so if a class doesn&#39;t say `final` you can&#39;t know if that was explicit or implicit. But with this proposal, we&#39;ll have to gain an `inheritable` keyword (and presumably a `sealed` keyword if we get sealed behavior), which means every single class can be annotated with a keyword indicating an explicit decision was made. Sure, people could still leave off the keyword when they explicitly choose the default behavior, but we could encourage a habit of always adding the keyword even if it&#39;s for the default behavior just to indicate that this decision was intentional.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Kevin Ballard<br></p><p>Thanks for this Kevin.  I have been trying to make these arguments throughout the thread but maybe haven’t been as eloquent as you are here.  The value of documenting the author&#39;s “statement of intent” and the value of knowing there cannot be any subclasses when no annotation exists should not be underestimated.<br></p><p>I’ve been following the thread very closely and have noticed six primary arguments against final by default:<br></p><p>1) Workarounds for framework “bugs”.  I put “bugs” in quotes because I think it is likely that sometimes it is not exactly a bug, but misunderstood or disliked behavior that is being “worked around&quot;.  No need to rehash this.  It’s been beaten to death.  It’s also irrelevant as it’s clear that the default is almost certainly going to be at least `sealed`.  It’s also irrelevant because Apple’s frameworks are currently written in Objective-C, not Swift, and when Apple begins writing frameworks in Swift they are very likely to be thinking carefully about subclassing as part of the API contract decision.<br></p><p>2) Flexibility.  If I don’t need inheritance when I first write a type and later realize I do need it, I have to revisit the type and add an `inheritable` annotation later.

If you don’t you are asking for trouble as inheritance was not considered when it was written.  Adding an `inheritable` annotation is trivial when compared to the analysis that should be performed when it becomes a superclass.<br></p><p>3) Annoyance.  Some consider it to be annoying to have to annotate a class declaration in order to inherit from it.  People stating this argument either are either writing a lot of superclasses or are so bothered by the need to annotate their type declarations that they avoid `final` and its related benefits when that is really the right thing for their class.  For me personally, `final` is the right thing for most classes I write.  I also think adding a `final` annotation is the right thing to do if you’re not sure whether it will be a superclass or not.  The need to modify the annotation will remind you that you haven’t fully considered inheritance in your design yet.<br></p><p>4) Testing.  This is solvable with behavior similar to @testable.

This should also not influence the decision about what the default is for production code.  I would not have a problem with a prototyping environment allowing `inheritable` by default (maybe a Playground mode?).  There could even be a tool that migrates the prototype to a real project and adds the `inheritable` annotation where necessary.  Regardless of what happens here, the prototyping problem can and should be solved independently of the production language and should not influence the default is used in and impacts production code.<br></p><p>6) Education.

This is a tough question, and I find myself torn. I’m sympathetic to both lines of argument.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; It’s not entirely true that “you can never take back” overridability — you can make a breaking API change with a new major version, of course — but it’s a compelling point nonetheless. One default is clearly safer than the other, at least for the library author. “Safe by default” is indeed the Swift MO. (Well, except for array subscripting.

I know what I’m getting into when I solve a problem with a hack, and if the hack ships, it’s only because I weighed the risks and benefits. We app developers rely on swizzling, dubious subclassing, and (especially) undocumented behavior far more often than any of us would like. It is just part of the reality of making things ship — and an important part of the success of Apple’s app ecosystem.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; This debate reminds me of something that often happens when a humans-and-paper process moves to software. When the software starts rigorously enforcing all the rules the humans were theoretically following all along, and it turns out that quite a lot of in-the-moment nuanced human judgement was crucial to making everything work. With nuance removed, things fall apart — and instead of things at last achieving the rigor that seemed so desirable in theory, the process has to explicitly loosen.

Joe’s arguments sway me in principle. In practice, if Swift does indeed moves us toward “less wiggle room, less hackable” by default, then that wiggle room _will_ have to come from somewhere else: perhaps more open sourcing and more forking, or faster turnaround on fixes from library authors, or a larger portion of time spent by library authors explicitly exposing and documenting customization points.

No matter what the default is, the frameworks aren&#39;t going to suddenly rewrite themselves in Swift with final everything; Objective-C will still be what it is. Furthermore, we&#39;re only talking about language defaults; we&#39;re not taking away the ability for frameworks to make their classes publicly subclassable or dynamically overrideable. That&#39;s a policy decision for framework authors to make. The goal of &quot;sealed by default&quot; is to make sure the language doesn&#39;t make promises on the developer&#39;s behalf that they weren&#39;t ready to keep. ObjC&#39;s flexibility is valuable, and Apple definitely takes advantage of it internally all over place; Apple also has an army of compatibility engineers to make sure framework changes work well with existing software. Not every developer can afford that maintenance burden/flexibility tradeoff, though, so that flexibility is something you ought to opt in to. You can always safely add public subclassability and dynamic overrideability in new framework versions, but you can never take them back.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Dec 22, 2015, at 12:31 AM, Brent Royal-Gordon via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Just imagine going through UIKit and marking every class inheritable *by hand*—no cheating with a script—and you&#39;ll have some idea of the additional burden you&#39;ll be imposing on developers as they write their code. The proposals that every single method should be explicitly marked as overridable are even worse; frankly, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to use Swift if you forced me to put a `virtual` keyword on every declaration.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I worry that the team&#39;s use of Swift to build the standard library, and their close association with teams building OS frameworks, is biasing the language a little bit. I think that, in all likelihood, most Swift code is in individual applications, and most libraries are not published outside of a single team. If I&#39;m right, then most Swift code will probably be quite tolerant of small but technically &quot;breaking&quot; ABI changes, such as making a class `final`, or (as mentioned in another thread) making a closure `@noescape`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; That won&#39;t be true of published library code, of course. But published library code is a small minority of the Swift code people will write, and it already will require greater scrutiny and more careful design. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; There is already a good opportunity to reflect on whether or not an API should be `final`. It&#39;s when you put the `public` keyword on it. I think programmers will have a better, easier time writing their code if, in this case, we put a little bit of trust in them, rather than erecting yet another hoop they must jump through.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps we could even provide a &quot;strict interfaces&quot; mode that published frameworks can turn on, which would require you to declare the heritability of every class and member. But even that may not be a good idea, because I also suspect that, in the field, most published libraries probably have to be extended in ways the library&#39;s author did not expect or anticipate. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This means doing some dangerous overriding, yes. But a UI that breaks after an iOS upgrade is not nearly as dangerous to my business as a three-month delay while I reimplement half of UIKit because someone in Cupertino thought they knew what I need better than I do and turned off—or even worse, *left turned off without a single thought*—subclassing of UIBarButtonItem.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The bottom line is this: Your users like Swift&#39;s strictures when they&#39;re helpful. *This stricture is not helpful.* Library users don&#39;t accidentally subclass things, and with the `override` keyword in Swift, they don&#39;t accidentally override them either. And where it truly is important, for safety or for speed, to prevent subclassing, we already have `final`. Making it the default is less safety than suffering.<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151223/c1a3d48e/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecdb231117dda838340bfcbb8873d28e?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>Paul Cantrell</string> &lt;cantrell at pobox.com&gt;<p>December 23, 2015 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>An omission in Matthey’s summary:<br></p><p>____<br></p><p>While tentatively supporting the proposal, some on the thread express a concern about its implications:<br></p><p>A shift toward more defensive programming in libraries prevents ad hoc workarounds in client projects.

ObjC&#39;s flexibility is valuable, and Apple definitely takes advantage of it internally all over place; Apple also has an army of compatibility engineers to make sure framework changes work well with existing software. Not every developer can afford that maintenance burden/flexibility tradeoff, though, so that flexibility is something you ought to opt in to.

But a UI that breaks after an iOS upgrade is not nearly as dangerous to my business as a three-month delay while I reimplement half of UIKit because someone in Cupertino thought they knew what I need better than I do and turned off—or even worse, *left turned off without a single thought*—subclassing of UIBarButtonItem.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The bottom line is this: Your users like Swift&#39;s strictures when they&#39;re helpful. *This stricture is not helpful.* Library users don&#39;t accidentally subclass things, and with the `override` keyword in Swift, they don&#39;t accidentally override them either. And where it truly is important, for safety or for speed, to prevent subclassing, we already have `final`. Making it the default is less safety than suffering.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151223/44f0daf0/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc3a9ea0c6c870343d9acb4ac3059cdc?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>Matthew Johnson</string> &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt;<p>December 23, 2015 at 08:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Dec 23, 2015, at 11:36 AM, Paul Cantrell &lt;cantrell at pobox.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; An omission in Matthey’s summary:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ____<br>&gt; <br>&gt; While tentatively supporting the proposal, some on the thread express a concern about its implications:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; A shift toward more defensive programming in libraries prevents ad hoc workarounds in client projects. Clients of Objective-C libraries commonly work around bugs, shortcomings, and feature gaps with swizzling and dubious subclassing. These hacks, while undesirable in principle, are part of the current Apple development culture and ecosystem. Mechanisms that prevent such hacks, including but not limited to “final by default” or “sealed by default,” must be accompanied by a shift in how library authors think about their API design, and how they interact with their community. This shift will impose a new burden on library authors.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ___<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Matthew assures me off-list that this is distinct from his #1, which was meant only as a comment on Apple’s policies being independent of this proposal.<br>&gt; <br></p><p>I want to thank Paul for pointing out an omission in the list I posted this morning.

If the authors agree in theory, but don’t want to do the implementation work of designing a proper superclass, do the work yourself and make a contribution.<br>4. If the authors disagree they would probably be using final if it wasn’t the default.  You can still fork the project and make any changes you desire, including allowing inheritance.

I put “bugs” in quotes because I think it is likely that sometimes it is not exactly a bug, but misunderstood or disliked behavior that is being “worked around&quot;.  No need to rehash this.  It’s been beaten to death.  It’s also irrelevant as it’s clear that the default is almost certainly going to be at least `sealed`.  It’s also irrelevant because Apple’s frameworks are currently written in Objective-C, not Swift, and when Apple begins writing frameworks in Swift they are very likely to be thinking carefully about subclassing as part of the API contract decision.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 2) Flexibility.  If I don’t need inheritance when I first write a type and later realize I do need it, I have to revisit the type and add an `inheritable` annotation later.  This is closely related to argument #2 and mostly relevant during prototyping (argument #5).  IMO when this scenario arises you should have to revisit the original type.  If you don’t you are asking for trouble as inheritance was not considered when it was written.  Adding an `inheritable` annotation is trivial when compared to the analysis that should be performed when it becomes a superclass.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 3) Annoyance.  Some consider it to be annoying to have to annotate a class declaration in order to inherit from it.  People stating this argument either are either writing a lot of superclasses or are so bothered by the need to annotate their type declarations that they avoid `final` and its related benefits when that is really the right thing for their class.  For me personally, `final` is the right thing for most classes I write.  I also think adding a `final` annotation is the right thing to do if you’re not sure whether it will be a superclass or not.  The need to modify the annotation will remind you that you haven’t fully considered inheritance in your design yet.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 4) Testing.  This is solvable with behavior similar to @testable.  It should not influence the decision about what the default is for production code.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 5) Prototyping.  This should also not influence the decision about what the default is for production code.  I would not have a problem with a prototyping environment allowing `inheritable` by default (maybe a Playground mode?).  There could even be a tool that migrates the prototype to a real project and adds the `inheritable` annotation where necessary.  Regardless of what happens here, the prototyping problem can and should be solved independently of the production language and should not influence the default is used in and impacts production code.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 6) Education.  There may be some value in allowing inheritance by default in education settings, especially early on.  I view this as being quite similar to the prototyping case and again should not have an influence on the default that professionals use in production code.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; If I have missed any of the major arguments against making `final` the default please respond with them.  I would be happy to add them to the list.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I don’t find any of these arguments compelling.  The only one that is really relevant to production code (once you accept the reality of #1) is annoyance which I consider a minor complaint that is definitely not relevant to my code and is likely not relevant to many other people’s code as well.  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On the other hand, the argument for `final` as default is compelling IMHO.  As has been stated many times, inheritance is part of an API contract that needs to be considered as clearly as anything else.  This still applies when the API is internal to an app.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Final by default greatly improves our ability to get up to speed on a new codebase quickly and reason about the code:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 1) When I look at an unannotated class declaration I know there are no subclasses.  I don’t have to search the code to look for subclasses.  <br>&gt;&gt; 2) I know that where there are superclasses, the author was reminded by the language to consider inheritance.  They may have made mistakes in the design of the superclass, but at least the language gave them a subtle reminder that they need to think about it.  <br>&gt;&gt; 3) I also know there will not be any subclasses in the future unless someone adds an `inheritable` annotation (in which case they are responsible for considering the implications of that).  The `inheritable` annotation also serves as a good prompt for code reviews to consider the implications of that annotation if / when the class becomes an intentional superclass.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Of course all of these advantages also apply to a codebase where I am the sole author and maintainer when I come back to it year or two later and have forgotten some details.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; One consideration that has not been definitively established one way or the other is frequency of use.  In application code are there usually more classes that are superclasses (or could reasonably be a superclass in the future without additional analysis and design)?  Or are there usually more classes that are `final`, effectively final, or should be final, at least until further analysis and design has been performed?  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; In my experience the reality is that the majority of my classes inherit from UIKit classes, but are not themselves superclasses.  I don’t claim to speak for anyone else, but I think we would find that to be the most common pattern if we looked at the question closely.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I hope this is a reasonably accurate summary of the positions on both sides of this.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Matthew<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Tue, Dec 22, 2015, at 09:03 AM, Paul Cantrell via swift-evolution wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Joe’s and Brent’s writeups copied below really get to the heart of this for me. This is a tough question, and I find myself torn. I’m sympathetic to both lines of argument.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s not entirely true that “you can never take back” overridability — you can make a breaking API change with a new major version, of course — but it’s a compelling point nonetheless. One default is clearly safer than the other, at least for the library author. “Safe by default” is indeed the Swift MO. (Well, except for array subscripting. And any public API involving tuples, for which any change, even type widening, is a breaking change. And….OK, it’s not absolute, but “safe by default” is the MO 95% of the time.) “Final by default” just seems more Swift-like to me.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Despite that, Joe, I have to agree with Brent on his central point: the perspective that comes from spending a lot of time _writing_ libraries is very different from one who spend more time _using_ them. Yes, UIKit is not going to be rewritten in Swift anytime soon, but Brent is rightly imagining a future where the Swift way is The Way.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I weigh the safety argument against the many long hours I’ve spent beating my head against library behaviors, wishing I could read UIKit’s source code, wishing I could tweak that one little thing that I can’t control, and being grateful for the dubious workaround that saves the day — yes, even when a subsequent OS update breaks it. I know what I’m getting into when I solve a problem with a hack, and if the hack ships, it’s only because I weighed the risks and benefits. We app developers rely on swizzling, dubious subclassing, and (especially) undocumented behavior far more often than any of us would like. It is just part of the reality of making things ship — and an important part of the success of Apple’s app ecosystem.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This debate reminds me of something that often happens when a humans-and-paper process moves to software. When the software starts rigorously enforcing all the rules the humans were theoretically following all along, and it turns out that quite a lot of in-the-moment nuanced human judgement was crucial to making everything work. With nuance removed, things fall apart — and instead of things at last achieving the rigor that seemed so desirable in theory, the process has to explicitly loosen.

Thanks to Matthew for his eloquent summary of the arguments against, and counterpoints.<br></p><p>&gt; 1) Workarounds for framework “bugs”.  I put “bugs” in quotes because I think it is likely that sometimes it is not exactly a bug, but misunderstood or disliked behavior that is being “worked around&quot;.  No need to rehash this.  It’s been beaten to death.  It’s also irrelevant as it’s clear that the default is almost certainly going to be at least `sealed`.  It’s also irrelevant because Apple’s frameworks are currently written in Objective-C, not Swift, and when Apple begins writing frameworks in Swift they are very likely to be thinking carefully about subclassing as part of the API contract decision.<br></p><p>I think this is the argument that convinced me regarding framework monkey patching. If the frameworks are in Objective-C, then the proposal is either irrelevant, the behavior for subclassing Objective-C classes with this proposal hasn&#39;t yet been defined, or we can carve out an exception for @objc classes. If the frameworks are written in Swift, nothing is stopping Apple from slapping &#39;final&#39; on all the classes they don&#39;t want developers to inherit from, even if the proposal is rejected; neither is there anything stopping them from making all their classes inheritable (if that happened to be what they wanted, which it isn&#39;t).<br></p><p>Other than that, all the other major arguments seem to stem from convenience, and there are conceivably workarounds for all of them for the specific use cases being addressed. For example, just as we have @testable to subvert access control for testing purposes, we should have some sort of modifier to allow test code to subclass &#39;final&#39; classes to create mocks or harnesses.<br></p><p>Arguments aside, I like this proposal because it creates a clear distinction within library (and even application-internal code) between &quot;class as a reference semantics equivalent to struct&quot; and &quot;class as an extension point for further customization&quot;. This is a useful tool for building API contracts, just like access control modifiers or generic types for arguments/return values.<br></p><p>There might be performance benefits, but I expect them to be relatively minor given how WMO works, and how someone (I think Chris) has mentioned they want to extend that optimization to modules as well in the future with the package manager.<br></p><p>Best,<br>Austin<br></p><p>&gt; 2) Flexibility.  If I don’t need inheritance when I first write a type and later realize I do need it, I have to revisit the type and add an `inheritable` annotation later.  This is closely related to argument #2 and mostly relevant during prototyping (argument #5).  IMO when this scenario arises you should have to revisit the original type.  If you don’t you are asking for trouble as inheritance was not considered when it was written.  Adding an `inheritable` annotation is trivial when compared to the analysis that should be performed when it becomes a superclass.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 3) Annoyance.  Some consider it to be annoying to have to annotate a class declaration in order to inherit from it.  People stating this argument either are either writing a lot of superclasses or are so bothered by the need to annotate their type declarations that they avoid `final` and its related benefits when that is really the right thing for their class.  For me personally, `final` is the right thing for most classes I write.  I also think adding a `final` annotation is the right thing to do if you’re not sure whether it will be a superclass or not.  The need to modify the annotation will remind you that you haven’t fully considered inheritance in your design yet.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 4) Testing.  This is solvable with behavior similar to @testable.  It should not influence the decision about what the default is for production code.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 5) Prototyping.  This should also not influence the decision about what the default is for production code.  I would not have a problem with a prototyping environment allowing `inheritable` by default (maybe a Playground mode?).  There could even be a tool that migrates the prototype to a real project and adds the `inheritable` annotation where necessary.  Regardless of what happens here, the prototyping problem can and should be solved independently of the production language and should not influence the default is used in and impacts production code.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 6) Education.  There may be some value in allowing inheritance by default in education settings, especially early on.  I view this as being quite similar to the prototyping case and again should not have an influence on the default that professionals use in production code.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If I have missed any of the major arguments against making `final` the default please respond with them.  I would be happy to add them to the list.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I don’t find any of these arguments compelling.  The only one that is really relevant to production code (once you accept the reality of #1) is annoyance which I consider a minor complaint that is definitely not relevant to my code and is likely not relevant to many other people’s code as well.  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; On the other hand, the argument for `final` as default is compelling IMHO.  As has been stated many times, inheritance is part of an API contract that needs to be considered as clearly as anything else.  This still applies when the API is internal to an app.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Final by default greatly improves our ability to get up to speed on a new codebase quickly and reason about the code:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1) When I look at an unannotated class declaration I know there are no subclasses.  I don’t have to search the code to look for subclasses.  <br>&gt; 2) I know that where there are superclasses, the author was reminded by the language to consider inheritance.  They may have made mistakes in the design of the superclass, but at least the language gave them a subtle reminder that they need to think about it.  <br>&gt; 3) I also know there will not be any subclasses in the future unless someone adds an `inheritable` annotation (in which case they are responsible for considering the implications of that).  The `inheritable` annotation also serves as a good prompt for code reviews to consider the implications of that annotation if / when the class becomes an intentional superclass.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Of course all of these advantages also apply to a codebase where I am the sole author and maintainer when I come back to it year or two later and have forgotten some details.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; One consideration that has not been definitively established one way or the other is frequency of use.  In application code are there usually more classes that are superclasses (or could reasonably be a superclass in the future without additional analysis and design)?  Or are there usually more classes that are `final`, effectively final, or should be final, at least until further analysis and design has been performed?  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; In my experience the reality is that the majority of my classes inherit from UIKit classes, but are not themselves superclasses.  I don’t claim to speak for anyone else, but I think we would find that to be the most common pattern if we looked at the question closely.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I hope this is a reasonably accurate summary of the positions on both sides of this.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Matthew<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Tue, Dec 22, 2015, at 09:03 AM, Paul Cantrell via swift-evolution wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Joe’s and Brent’s writeups copied below really get to the heart of this for me.

Making it the default is less safety than suffering.<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecdb231117dda838340bfcbb8873d28e?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>Paul Cantrell</string> &lt;cantrell at pobox.com&gt;<p>December 22, 2015 at 09:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Dec 22, 2015, at 6:24 PM, Dave Abrahams &lt;dabrahams at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Dec 22, 2015, at 9:03 AM, Paul Cantrell via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I weigh the safety argument against the many long hours I’ve spent beating my head against library behaviors, wishing I could read UIKit’s source code, wishing I could tweak that one little thing that I can’t control, and being grateful for the dubious workaround that saves the day — yes, even when a subsequent OS update breaks it. I know what I’m getting into when I solve a problem with a hack, and if the hack ships, it’s only because I weighed the risks and benefits. We app developers rely on swizzling, dubious subclassing, and (especially) undocumented behavior far more often than any of us would like. It is just part of the reality of making things ship — and an important part of the success of Apple’s app ecosystem.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The same argument implies that we never should have created Swift as it is; that leaving everything dynamic everywhere is necessary so people can get their work done.  In some ways it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.  I once knew a programmer that argued that all properties/ivars should be public, in case you need to go in and work around some problem.  Naturally, he “needed&quot; to take advantage of that public exposure all the time.  I predict that, as Swift does more to disallow unintended effects, you’ll start to see fewer and fewer of the kinds of problem that require these dubious workarounds.<br></p><p>Well, coming from a “strong static types or bust” background, when I first worked with Ruby I was shocked at how the world did not fall apart even though everything is open to monkey patching! It’s definitely a different mindset — but one in which people exercise careful thought, and write good, reliable software. This stunned me when I first encountered that world, but it’s an empirical fact that it can work quite well. The ways in which it succeeds forced me to rethink a lot of how I approach code.<br></p><p>That said, the “everything dynamic and rewirable” way is _clearly_ not the Swift way, and with “The same argument implies…,” you’re misreading my argument.<br></p><p>In principle, I lean in favor of final by default. It’s clearly more consistent with Swift’s approach. I’m just pointing out that there will need to be something of a culture / ecosystem shift if the platform follows Swift’s lead toward more defensive programming and tighter control. The approaches that have been working for Objective-C library authors, including but not limited to Apple, will not continue to work as is.<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; I’m not totally opposed to final by default. Joe’s arguments sway me in principle. In practice, if Swift does indeed moves us toward “less wiggle room, less hackable” by default, then that wiggle room _will_ have to come from somewhere else: perhaps more open sourcing and more forking, or faster turnaround on fixes from library authors, or a larger portion of time spent by library authors explicitly exposing and documenting customization points. The new effort involved for library authors is nothing to sneeze at.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; No, it’s nothing to sneeze at; it is essential for creating reliable software.  As a library author, I support anything that helps produce that level of care :-)<br></p><p>Yes: a high level of care, and also open communication, and faster turnaround, and good listening, and … well, exactly the sort of effort Apple is putting forth right now for Swift!<br></p><p>Cheers,<br></p><p>Paul<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a838c63b9093a77fb88231d65effa3b3?s=50"></div><header><strong>Final by default for classes and methods</strong> from <string>Drew Crawford</string> &lt;drew at sealedabstract.com&gt;<p>December 22, 2015 at 06:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Dec 22, 2015, at 11:03 AM, Paul Cantrell via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I’m not totally opposed to final by default.

Trying to patch over these bugs in your own code is (1) obviously not an answer Apple would support, but also (2) fraught with peril, and (3) likely to break in the next OS release.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; TLDR: It&#39;s already unsafe to do this with the existing set of Swift features.

That is a lot of radars.  The problem resolution strategies available to third-party developers are very very bad.  Subclassing is one of those &quot;bad&quot; resolution strategies that everybody agrees is awful, but what are you going to do, rewrite the core Apple frameworks by yourself?<br></p><p>Yes, as it turns out.  Many of us were pleasantly surprised (and some of us literally could not believe) Apple&#39;s support for this effort with swift-corelibs-foundation.  But I think (some) on this list may be unprepared for the full extent to which the community will be taking on an active role.  I actually have a whole queue of patches in the basement that predate swift-corelibs-foundation completely that I will be sending upstream slowly, and what gets rejected will be third-partied somewhere.  That&#39;s before we even get to the question of replacing some of the other technologies that don&#39;t appear on github.com/apple &lt;http://github.com/apple&gt;.  <br></p><p>IMO making the transition to &quot;open&quot; frameworks that we can actually fork/fix/bundle ourselves is the Right Solution™ to this whole &quot;final&quot; debate, but I think it is important to preview for everybody involved that this is the straw on a very overworked camel.  I had to subclass UIKit yet again just a few days ago.  Paul Cantrell is 100% right that the wiggle room will have to come from somewhere. <br></p><p>The wiggle room will come from the community stepping up and making our own tools.  That has been happening to some extent in the dark, but presently it will be happening in the daylight.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151222/3e9e2926/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
