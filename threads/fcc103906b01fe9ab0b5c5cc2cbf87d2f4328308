I think it&#39;s<br>&gt; still missing Erica&#39;s point about some paramaters being more tightly<br>&gt; coupled to each other than to the base name. That&#39;s sort of addressed<br>&gt; with this:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;    a.moveTo(x: 300, y: 400) // &quot;a, move to 300&quot; is a sentence <br>&gt;&gt;                             // but doesn&#39;t describe the primary <br>&gt;&gt;                             // semantics, which are to move in both<br>&gt;&gt;                             // x and y.  Thus, x gets a label.<br></p><p>Not “sort of” :-).<br></p><p>It&#39;s addressed, in practice, by the “primary semantics” clause.  When<br>the association between the first and second parameters is stronger than<br>the relationship between the first parameter and the base name, the<br>primary semantics will not be described by the a sentence that ends with<br>the first argument.  As I wrote in an earlier message, it&#39;s important to<br>find minimal rules that cover everything we want to express in practice.<br></p><p>&gt; but I think &quot;describing the primary semantics of the call&quot; could be<br>&gt; more explicit. Even just the word &quot;fully [describing]&quot; would help.<br></p><p>I don&#39;t see how.  That would imply that, in order to omit the argument<br>label, any parameters after the first must have no semantic effect at<br>all.<br></p><p>&gt; Given that, &quot;a.tracksHavingMediaType(.WaxCylinder, genre: .Jazz)&quot;<br>&gt; would be incorrect, because you can&#39;t ignore the &quot;genre&quot; part when<br>&gt; describing the call. &#39;tracks(mediaType:genre:)&#39; or<br>&gt; &#39;tracksMatching(mediaType:genre:)&#39; would both be fine, though the<br>&gt; former includes a new convention that plural noun basenames mean<br>&gt; filtered fetches.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Then the next problem is that the first version of the library may<br>&gt; only have one form, and &quot;tracksMatching(mediaType:)&quot; would seem<br>&gt; redundant, so it&#39;s just &quot;tracksMatching(_:)&quot;. Then the two-argument<br>&gt; form is added later, and suddenly they&#39;re not quite symmetrical. On<br>&gt; second thought, maybe that&#39;s okay as long as they have the same base<br>&gt; name.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Jordan<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
