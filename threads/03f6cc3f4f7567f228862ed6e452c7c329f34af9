There are a *lot* of little nooks and crannies to this proposal. How certain are we that we&#39;ve identified all the potential problems? Has this been prototyped?<br></p><p><br>It has not been prototyped. We (== various developers that work on the Swift compiler and standard library) have talked about the implementation of this feature on-and-off for several years, and have some experience with similar features in other languages, so we’re fairly confident in the overall design and shape of the feature. There are undoubtedly things that we’ve missed that will come up (as has been the case in many swift-evolution proposals that precede their implementations), and there are some unanswered questions—for example, John McCall and I realized today that we may have a non-termination issue in the type checker for certain badly-behaved (and probably ill-formed) protocol conformances.<br></p><p>I’m not sure the length of the detailed design section is really an indicator of complexity here, though. Much of it is describing the limitations of the model and motivating the ban on overlapping conformances. Only the section on “implied conditional conformances” has real implementation impact, and that’s not actually new territory for the compiler. So, yes, this is a complex feature. I think we can manage it with this proposal.<br></p><p>	- Doug<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc3a9ea0c6c870343d9acb4ac3059cdc?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0143: Conditional Conformances</strong> from <string>Matthew Johnson</string> &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt;<p>September 30, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>Huge +1.  Conditional conformances are at the very top of the list of frustrating limitations in Swift.  Lifting that limitation can’t happen soon enough for me.<br></p><p>I have some concern that the restriction on overlapping conformances could continue to cause occasional frustration at times.  However, I don’t have a solid basis for that concern in the sense of specific use cases.  Doug also raises very good points about the complexity they introduce.  <br></p><p>I would like to see the specific details and restrictions discussed in more detail and possibly revised following that discussion.  I trust the core team to make the right decision.  If, after in-depth discussion, the core team decides to accept the proposal as-is I support that.  Conditional conformances are a huge step forward.  We will gain a tremendously important facility with them even if pain points still remain.  That said, I do hope we will have options for addressing pain points that arise down the road.<br></p><p>I would also like to see serious consideration given to the performance implications of choosing the “least specialized” (but most general) conformance.  As noted in the discussion, this seems like it could be a slippery slope to sub-optimal performance.  My hope for Swift is that generic code will achieve performance as close to the “zero cost abstraction” principle in the C++ community (especially if / when we have a Rust-like ownership system that allows us to avoid reference counting).<br>&gt; Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>Yes.  It is one of the most significant problems with the current state of the language.<br>&gt; Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>Yes.<br>&gt; How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>I am extremely familiar with the limitations of the current model having bumped up against them continuously.  I have given this specific proposal consideration somewhere between a quick read and an in-depth study.  I have been following the discussion in-depth and have read everyone’s comments carefully.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160930/d446f498/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/89e9af7c5754673419c8fac930319700?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0143: Conditional Conformances</strong> from <string>Russ Bishop</string> &lt;xenadu at gmail.com&gt;<p>September 30, 2016 at 10:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Sep 28, 2016, at 3:15 PM, Joe Groff via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The review of “Conditional Conformances” begins now and runs through October 7.

When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt;&gt; Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt;&gt; Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt;&gt; If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt;&gt; How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt;&gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Thank you,<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; -Joe<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Review Manager<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20161112/3a30b0b1/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
