Enums are kind of a special case, but they are at least a static member so there&#39;s a clearer case for them vs this example which is an instance member, which could lead to ambiguity.<br></p><p>I mean, I&#39;d be all for allowing this shorthand for instance members as well, but we&#39;d need to get around issues of this ambiguity, perhaps with a shorthand identifier for type? As pointed out, you can actually use Foo.getBar, but while this is fine for a type with such a short name, it&#39;s not convenient if your type name is much longer, meaning in many cases it will remain easiest to just do { $0.getBar() } or similar. If we could reserve a special type identifier, or use $T or something it might be easier, but it&#39;d need to be an elegant choice (I don&#39;t really like either of mine, it&#39;s just to give the idea).<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
