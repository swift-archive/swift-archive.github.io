I thought the unlabeled tuple would implicitly work where a labeled tuple with the same sequence of member types was required.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; // In the future...<br>&gt;&gt; x.someFunc(_:y:z...:)(1, 2, myPack...)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -Matthew<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; [*] On a tangential topic, how is Swift going to handle generics across module boundaries in the future? People are complaining that their library generics code is too slow because specialization is impossible, and specialization only happens on stdlib generic types because of some hacks. https://github.com/lorentey/BTree#generics notes that @_specialize might be exposed as an attribute for library author use in the future. It might be the case that every variadic generic type might need to be @_specialize by default, because I can&#39;t imagine a variadic equivalent to the dynamic-dispatch solution currently used to implement regular generics without specialization.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Agree that cross module specialization (and WPO generally) is very important. When modules have a nontrivial performance cost (inability to specialize generics) their use is discouraged to some degree.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Without “structural unions” you’d probably wind up with something like this for a variadic implementation:<br></p><p>  struct ChainSequenceIterator&lt;E,I… where I:Iterator, I.Element == E&gt; {<br></p><p>    private var (…iterators): (I?…) // &lt;- I hope this works<br></p><p>    mutating func next() -&gt; E? {<br>      // find first non-nil iterator, try to get next element from it; <br>      // if next is non-nil, return that, otherwise nil it out and<br>      // find the *next* non-nil iterator, etc….<br>    }<br></p><p>  }<br></p><p>…which could be made to work, but is wasteful in some ways (you have space to store n iterators…). You can make it a little cleaner if you have some way of doing integer-based indexing into the variadic parameters, but that doesn’t change the space requirements (it’s still going to need room for all `n` iterators + bookkeeping).<br></p><p>If, however, you have some variadic-compatible structural unions, you can write it as (roughly):<br></p><p>  struct ChainSequenceIterator&lt;E,S… where S:Sequence, S.Iterator.Element == E&gt; {<br>     private let source: ChainSequence&lt;E,S…&gt;<br>     private var iterator: (S.Iterator |…) // (meant to be ~ `(S1.Iterator | S2.Iterator | S3.Iterator | …. | SN.Iterator)` )<br>     private var done: Bool = false<br></p><p>     mutating func next() -&gt; E? {<br>       // if not `done`, try `next` on current iterator in `iterator`<br>       // if non-nil, return, otherwise advance to next iterator, etc., ...<br>     }<br>  }<br></p><p>…(how much space this actually saves depends on the size of `source` vs the size of the iterators, but it’s *possible* to save space this way). <br></p><p>Variadic generics *can* be added w/out structural unions — they’re a pure &quot;nice-to-have&quot; — but having support for variadic &quot;product types&quot; w/out corresponding variadic &quot;sum types&quot; is going to complicate-or-prevent certain constructs.<br></p><p>D: Make Parameter-Packs Named<br></p><p>I understand the appeal of the `…T`-style syntax, but I’d at least consider giving parameter-packs a more-concrete existence, e.g. something like this:<br></p><p>  // strawman declaration syntax:<br>  struct Foo&lt;I,J,K#ParameterPack&gt; {<br></p><p>    // `K` here will refer to the variadic parameter-pack itself;<br>    // cf the `typealias` below , but basically K ~ the tuple of its types<br></p><p>    typealias KValueTuple = #tuple(K) // == tuple of values of type K.0, K.1, etc.)<br>    typealias KTypeTyple - #typeTuple(K) // == tuple of types like K.0, K.1<br>    typealias FirstK = #first(K) <br>    typealias LastK = #last(K) <br>    static var kArity: Int { return #count(K) } <br>    // and so on<br></p><p>  }<br></p><p>  // straw man point-of-use syntax, can be adjusted of course:<br>  let concreteFoo = Foo&lt;I,J,K:(K0,K1,K2,…,Kn)&gt;<br></p><p>…which complicates the grammar, but IMHO feels a lot nicer than having a lot of &quot;implicit rules&quot; about what `…` means and so on.<br></p><p>&gt; On May 28, 2016, at 3:03 PM, Austin Zheng via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hello swift-evolution,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I put together a draft proposal for the variadic generics feature described in &quot;Completing Generics&quot; as a major objective for Swift 3.x.

So a way to specify an equality relationship between &quot;adjacent&quot; sets of associated types?<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; B: Integer-Based Indexing<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I see it’s been brought up already, but I’d *strongly* suggest making support for integer-based “indexing” into variadic packs a priority.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What concerns me is that without support for that, I suspect a lot of code would have to get &quot;written twice” if using the “recursive” API on parameter packs.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Here’s a mock example:<br>&gt;   <br>&gt;   // a “weaker” dictionary-like protocol<br>&gt;   protocol LookupTable {<br>&gt;     associatedtype Key: Hashable<br>&gt;     associatedtype Value<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     subscript(key: Key) -&gt; Value? { get }    <br>&gt; <br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   /// Does a cascading search for values through a possibly *heterogeneous*<br>&gt;   /// collection of backing lookup tables…caching results to avoid subsequent searches<br>&gt;   struct HeterogeneousCascadingLookupTable&lt;K:Hashable,V,T… <br>&gt;     where <br>&gt;     T:LookupTable,<br>&gt;     T.Key == K,<br>&gt;     T.Value == V&gt; : LookupTable {<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   private let (tables): (T…)<br>&gt;   private var valueCache: [K:V] = [:]<br>&gt;   private var missingKeys: Set&lt;K&gt; = []<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   // implementation *with* integer-based indexing: <br>&gt;   subscript(key: K) -&gt; V? {<br>&gt;     get {<br>&gt;       guard !missingKeys.contains(key) else { return nil }<br>&gt;       if let cached = valueCache[key] { return cached }<br>&gt;       for index in 0..&lt;#count(T…) {<br>&gt;          if let v = tables[index][key] {<br>&gt;            valueCache[key] = v<br>&gt;            return v<br>&gt;          }<br>&gt;       }<br>&gt;       missingKeys.insert(key)<br>&gt;       return nil<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   // implementation without integer-based indexing (or equivalent mechanism):<br>&gt;   subscript(key: K) -&gt; V? {<br>&gt;     get {<br>&gt;       guard !missingKeys.contains(key) else { return nil }<br>&gt;       if let cached = valueCache[key] { return cached }<br>&gt;       if let value = self.lookupValue(for: key, in: self.tables) {<br>&gt;         valueCache[key] = value<br>&gt;         return value<br>&gt;       } else {<br>&gt;         missingKeys.insert(key)<br>&gt;         return nil<br>&gt;       }<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   // recursive lookup implementation (necessary b/c our type itself<br>&gt;   // isn’t defined by recursively-nesting itself)<br>&gt;   private final func lookupValue&lt;U… <br>&gt;     where <br>&gt;     U…: LookupTable,<br>&gt;     U.Key == K,<br>&gt;     U.Value == V&gt;(for key: K, in tables: U…) -&gt; V? {<br>&gt;     return #first(tables)[key] ?? self.lookupValue(for: key, in: #rest(tables))<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; …which isn’t the end of the world, but having to write a separate recursive implementation of each method that needs to step-through the variadic parameters would spread things out a bit, it’d seem.<br></p><p>I&#39;ll write something up.<br></p><p>for index in 0..&lt;#count(T…) {<br>    if let v = tables[index][key] {<br>        valueCache[key] = v<br>    	return v<br>    }<br>}<br></p><p>I assume this is all compile time code generation (unroll the loop in the source #count(T...) times for each arity that T... is instantiated as, with a different &#39;tables&#39; pack member value for each unrolled loop iteration). <br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; (Yes, this specific thing could be written today w/out variadics, but it illustrates the tradeoff here).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; C: “Variadic-Sum” / Structural-Union?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I mentioned this before in a response to the manifesto email, but will reiterate it here: there’s a fair amount of useful things you could do with variadic generics *if* there was also some similar way to get a “structural union”.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; A simple motivating example is something like a `Chain` sequence (analogous to `Zip`); e.g. something for which `chain(a,b)` is the sequence of ‘the elements in `a`, then the elements in `b`.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Although the proposed variadics make the sequence itself easy to write:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   // for now I&#39;d assume we need the `E` as a separate type parameter here,<br>&gt;   // but recall the previous point<br>&gt;   struct ChainSequence&lt;E,S… where S:Sequence, S.Iterator.Element == E&gt; {<br>&gt;     private let (…sequences): (S…)<br>&gt;     init(…arguments: S…) { … }  <br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; …the iterator is a bit more complicated. Without “structural unions” you’d probably wind up with something like this for a variadic implementation:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   struct ChainSequenceIterator&lt;E,I… where I:Iterator, I.Element == E&gt; {<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     private var (…iterators): (I?…) // &lt;- I hope this works<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     mutating func next() -&gt; E? {<br>&gt;       // find first non-nil iterator, try to get next element from it; <br>&gt;       // if next is non-nil, return that, otherwise nil it out and<br>&gt;       // find the *next* non-nil iterator, etc….<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; …which could be made to work, but is wasteful in some ways (you have space to store n iterators…). You can make it a little cleaner if you have some way of doing integer-based indexing into the variadic parameters, but that doesn’t change the space requirements (it’s still going to need room for all `n` iterators + bookkeeping).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If, however, you have some variadic-compatible structural unions, you can write it as (roughly):<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   struct ChainSequenceIterator&lt;E,S… where S:Sequence, S.Iterator.Element == E&gt; {<br>&gt;      private let source: ChainSequence&lt;E,S…&gt;<br>&gt;      private var iterator: (S.Iterator |…) // (meant to be ~ `(S1.Iterator | S2.Iterator | S3.Iterator | …. | SN.Iterator)` )<br>&gt;      private var done: Bool = false<br>&gt; <br>&gt;      mutating func next() -&gt; E? {<br>&gt;        // if not `done`, try `next` on current iterator in `iterator`<br>&gt;        // if non-nil, return, otherwise advance to next iterator, etc., ...<br>&gt;      }<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; …(how much space this actually saves depends on the size of `source` vs the size of the iterators, but it’s *possible* to save space this way). <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Variadic generics *can* be added w/out structural unions — they’re a pure &quot;nice-to-have&quot; — but having support for variadic &quot;product types&quot; w/out corresponding variadic &quot;sum types&quot; is going to complicate-or-prevent certain constructs.<br></p><p>This is interesting. Might it be possible with to accomplish this with existentials (this is sort of a cross-reference to a different proposal from the generics manifest)?

I think the dots at site of declaration don&#39;t really cause trouble, though, and are a little nicer to read than T#ParameterPack.<br></p><p>I agree #ParameterPack is awful and that T… at the declaration site is not a big deal.<br></p><p>What I don’t like is not having a way to refer to the pack itself other than via its “placeholder type” with some dots.<br></p><p>It also seems nicer to express things like a pack fusion with names for packs, but again in fairness it’s not terrible:<br></p><p>  struct Foo&lt;T…&gt; {<br>  }<br></p><p>  func +++&lt;T…,U…&gt;(lhs: Foo&lt;T…&gt;, rhs: Foo&lt;U…&gt;) -&gt; Foo&lt;#fuse(T…,U…)&gt; <br></p><p>…so I’m not sure what I think on this.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On May 28, 2016, at 3:03 PM, Austin Zheng via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello swift-evolution,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160530/2df25230/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b6a0b6562cd412f587c69d192f335161?s=50"></div><header><strong>Variadic generics discussion</strong> from <string>plx</string> &lt;plxswift at icloud.com&gt;<p>May 30, 2016 at 08:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>A few more comments inlined now that I’ve read it.<br></p><p>&gt; On May 30, 2016, at 7:44 AM, plx via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; - if you have e.g. 2+ packs, can you enforce (T…) and (U…) have the same arity?<br></p><p>Seems the answer is yes iff there’s a `T.Foo... == U.Bar…` style relationship, but no way to just request same-arity by itself?<br></p><p>&gt; - if you have e.g. 2+ packs, could you enforce e.g. T.Foo… == U.Bar ?<br></p><p>Missed this either before or you added it, sorry either way.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; …as always nice-to-have, but throwing them out there for consideration.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll write something up.<br></p><p>I like the `fold` construct but feel like for this use it needs a few more options-or-variants.<br></p><p>The first one is some more-explicit support for “early exit”.<br></p><p>EG for the cascading-lookup example, you can convert it to this `#fold`:<br></p><p>  private func lookupKey(key: K) -&gt; V? {<br>    return #fold(<br>      start: nil,<br>      reducer: { <br>        (table, value)<br>        in<br>        return value ?? table[key]<br>      },<br>      values: tables<br>    )<br>  }<br></p><p>…but unless the compiler is very savvy you are going to have a bunch of unneeded stuff even after your “success” (it won’t do another lookup, but it just seems wasteful and could be wasteful in other contexts).<br></p><p>Relatedly, that `#fold` is only going to work if the compiler can infer a proper type for the `table` argument to the `reducer`.<br></p><p>If you have to specify the types explicitly via a helper function, it seems like this won’t work:<br></p><p>  func lookupIfNecessary&lt;T:LookupTable where T.Key == K, T.Value == V&gt;(table: T,  key: K, value: V?) -&gt; V? {<br>     return value ?? table[key]<br>  }<br></p><p>…b/c the signature isn’t right for the reducer, and it seems like this might work:<br></p><p>  func createLookupFunction&lt;T:LookupTable where T.Key == K, T.Value == V&gt;(key: K) -&gt; (T, V?) -&gt; V? {<br>     return { (t,v) in return v ?? t[key] }<br>  }<br></p><p>  private func lookupKey(key: K) -&gt; V? {<br>    return #fold(<br>      start: nil,<br>      reducer: createLookupFunction(key), // &lt;- should work…I hope...<br>      values: tables<br>    )<br>  }<br></p><p>…but it seems a bit convoluted; perhaps there’s a trick here?

In theory the optimizer can know<br>&gt; to inline `__subscriptTables`, notice `index` is known at compile-time,<br>&gt; replace the switch with direct access, and arrive at the code you “really<br>&gt; want”:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   if let v = tables.0[key] { … } // assume returns out of here on success<br>&gt;   if let v = tables.1[key] { … } // assume returns out of here on success<br>&gt;<br>&gt; …but that’s obviously putting a lot of pressure on the compiler to convert<br>&gt; the `for index in #count(tables) { … }` code into something<br>&gt; equivalent-but-reasonable.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I’ll be sure to look @ at the proposed `fold` in this light.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>I&#39;m not sure if &#39;fold&#39; as currently expressed is powerful enough to do<br>something like this.

It&#39;s just more difficult to<br>read and possibly slower to execute.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; D: Make Parameter-Packs Named<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I understand the appeal of the `…T`-style syntax, but I’d at least<br>&gt; consider giving parameter-packs a more-concrete existence, e.g. something<br>&gt; like this:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   // strawman declaration syntax:<br>&gt;   struct Foo&lt;I,J,K#ParameterPack&gt; {<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     // `K` here will refer to the variadic parameter-pack itself;<br>&gt;     // cf the `typealias` below , but basically K ~ the tuple of its types<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     typealias KValueTuple = #tuple(K) // == tuple of values of type K.0,<br>&gt; K.1, etc.)<br>&gt;     typealias KTypeTyple - #typeTuple(K) // == tuple of types like K.0, K.1<br>&gt;     typealias FirstK = #first(K)<br>&gt;     typealias LastK = #last(K)<br>&gt;     static var kArity: Int { return #count(K) }<br>&gt;     // and so on<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   // straw man point-of-use syntax, can be adjusted of course:<br>&gt;   let concreteFoo = Foo&lt;I,J,K:(K0,K1,K2,…,Kn)&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; …which complicates the grammar, but IMHO feels a lot nicer than having a<br>&gt; lot of &quot;implicit rules&quot; about what `…` means and so on.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I think it makes sense to make pack usage explicit. I think the dots at<br>&gt; site of declaration don&#39;t really cause trouble, though, and are a little<br>&gt; nicer to read than T#ParameterPack.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I agree #ParameterPack is awful and that T… at the declaration site is not<br>&gt; a big deal.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What I don’t like is not having a way to refer to the pack itself other<br>&gt; than via its “placeholder type” with some dots.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It also seems nicer to express things like a pack fusion with names for<br>&gt; packs, but again in fairness it’s not terrible:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   struct Foo&lt;T…&gt; {<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   func +++&lt;T…,U…&gt;(lhs: Foo&lt;T…&gt;, rhs: Foo&lt;U…&gt;) -&gt; Foo&lt;#fuse(T…,U…)&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; …so I’m not sure what I think on this.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>I&#39;ll keep on thinking about this.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On May 28, 2016, at 3:03 PM, Austin Zheng via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hello swift-evolution,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160530/5d73ccf8/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/279fa63eae4ac804b4dbdb83686797bf?s=50"></div><header><strong>Variadic generics discussion</strong> from <string>Austin Zheng</string> &lt;austinzheng at gmail.com&gt;<p>May 29, 2016 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>I significantly rewrote the proposal to take into account as much feedback as I could.

This would be a separate proposal building on the capability of variadic generics but might be worth mentioning in “future directions”.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It might be worth reading again the generics manifesto’s comment about how the runtime cost of chasing up the protocol chain might turn it into a performance nightmare.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you talking about providing conditional conformance in a protocol extension: https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/GenericsManifesto.md#conditional-conformances-via-protocol-extensions ?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is not what I was talking about.  I was talking about extensions of structural types: https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/GenericsManifesto.md#extensions-of-structural-types<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the two sections are linked. My point is just to keep in mind what they say about the conformances that can be established at compile time, versus the scenarios that wind-up hitting the runtime reflection system to resolve a question (dynamic casts). <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; There are no performance concerns noted in Doug’s manifesto.  Extensions, including conformances for structural types is listed under “minor extensions”, not “maybe” or “unlikely”.  Providing extensions and conformances for structural types shouldn’t be any more difficult than doing so for any other variadic type.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Good... my moment of doubt came from reading the code involved in the differed initialization og metadata for the case of non fixed size tuples. I will play more with the compiler and see if I can trigger it. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; It sounds like you’re more familiar with the implementation than I am.  I don’t know how much work has been done to support general variadic types yet.  It’s possible there is still a lot of work to be done.  But I can’t imagine any reason variadic conformance would be more difficult for built-in structural types than it is for user-defined variadic types.<br></p><p>Hmm. Not sure what you call variadic types. As far as I can tell types have a fixed layout that the compiler is even able to compute. The only exception seemed to be these variable sized tuples that differ layout definition until runtime. But that is still not a variadic type. It is not that the struct is variadic, it is its parameter list that is variadic. That influences the cardinality of certain properties, but not the overall shape. What&#39;s interesting about the code in the manifesto is that it looks very much like &quot;...&quot; is a runtime construct, as opposed to trying the get the compiler to do the heavy lifting.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Matthew<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On May 29, 2016, at 7:36 PM, Austin Zheng via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I significantly rewrote the proposal to take into account as much feedback as I could.

But as far as I can tell they&#39;d require a great deal of macro-like functionality to go along with them. A way to define constant expressions would be required, so we could define &quot;#index = #count(T...)&quot; or something. Then we&#39;d need ways to manipulate that value (increment or decrement) if we wanted to work with the previous or next elements in a chain, we&#39;d need compile-time conditional checking so that a variadic generic could behave correctly for the first or last item in a vector, and so forth. Omitting these expensive features is going to limit the number of uses variadic generics have; is this tradeoff going to be worth it? Could we push off those features to a later date, if/when Swift gets an actual compile time metaprogramming design?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - The more I think about things, the more I&#39;m leaning towards the idea that tuples are the only construct necessary. We could get rid of most of the features of value packs/vectors, and allow them to only serve two roles: defining a variadic generic function, and spreading out a tuple in order to call a variadic generic function. (I think I prefer a spreading operator to bringing back the magic compiler tuple splat functionality.) They could also be &quot;spread out&quot; to define or specialize a different variadic generic type. Thoughts?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - With the existence of &#39;fold&#39;, might it be worth it to remove #tail() (and maybe #head), at least from v1? This would represent a slight loss of expressive power for common use cases in exchange for a considerable decrease in complexity.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Alternatively, some tuple-based designs might make this point obsolete. Imagine something like this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; func head&lt;T, ...U&gt;(input: (T, U...)) -&gt; T { ... }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; func tail&lt;T, ...U&gt;(input: (T, U...)) -&gt; (U...) { ... }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, any comments are welcome. I hope to continue evolving this proposal as the community decides what they want and don&#39;t want to see.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On May 28, 2016, at 1:03 PM, Austin Zheng &lt;austinzheng at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello swift-evolution,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I put together a draft proposal for the variadic generics feature described in &quot;Completing Generics&quot; as a major objective for Swift 3.x.

To wit:<br></p><p>1. We should dust off the old tuple indexing proposal (I actually forgot it was never reviewed) and get it through, along with tuple `count`, `map`, and probably a few other Collection-like operations which generate fixed signatures. (I&#39;m going to use a method-style syntax, but a #function-style syntax would work too; we could even introduce a .#method-style syntax.)<br></p><p>	let tuple: (Int, Int, Int, Int) = (2, 4, 6, 8)<br>	print(tuple[tuple.0])			// =&gt; 6<br>	print(tuple.map { $0 / 2 }) 	// =&gt; (1, 2, 3, 4)<br></p><p>2.

We should change our existing variadic parameters to create tuples, not Arrays.<br></p><p>	func print(_ items: (Any...), separator: String = &quot;&quot;, terminator: String = &quot;\n&quot;) {<br>		items.0	// Yes, that&#39;s a thing you can do<br></p><p>4. We should add a splat operator which unpacks tuples into (possibly variadic) parameters.<br></p><p>	print(tuple...)<br></p><p>5. We should allow you to define variadic type parameters.<br></p><p>	// Note: If you had written `items: Items` instead of `items: Items...`, it would&#39;ve taken a tuple <br>	// of various LocalizedStringConvertible types.<br>	func localizedPrint&lt;Items: (LocalizedStringConvertible...)&gt;(_ items: Items..., separator: String = &quot;&quot;, terminator: String = &quot;\n&quot;) {<br>		print(items.map { $0.localizedDescription }, separator: separator, terminator: terminator)<br>	}<br></p><p>6.

We should dust off the old tuple indexing proposal (I actually forgot<br>&gt; it was never reviewed) and get it through, along with tuple `count`, `map`,<br>&gt; and probably a few other Collection-like operations which generate fixed<br>&gt; signatures.

We should add a splat operator which unpacks tuples into (possibly<br>&gt; variadic) parameters.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         print(tuple...)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 5. We should allow you to define variadic type parameters.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         // Note: If you had written `items: Items` instead of `items:<br>&gt; Items...`, it would&#39;ve taken a tuple<br>&gt;         // of various LocalizedStringConvertible types.<br>&gt;         func localizedPrint&lt;Items: (LocalizedStringConvertible...)&gt;(_<br>&gt; items: Items..., separator: String = &quot;&quot;, terminator: String = &quot;\n&quot;) {<br>&gt;                 print(items.map { $0.localizedDescription }, separator:<br>&gt; separator, terminator: terminator)<br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 6.

That wouldn&#39;t be the case if you could splat arrays.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; (Incidentally, we might want to offer a pseudo-failable initializer to create a tuple from a sequence:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	if let triple = (Int, Int, Int)(intArray) {<br>&gt; 		return stride(from:to:by:)(triple...)<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That would indirectly allow you to splat the contents of an array into a parameter list.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; - As you said, how do variadic generics work in the 0- and 1-member cases?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I don&#39;t think 0-tuples are a big deal, except in that there&#39;s no good starting value for certain reductions. Adding a bottom type (as I did in the `reduce` example above) would fix that.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1-tuples are a bigger problem, because if you have a parameter like `(Any...)`, you can&#39;t afford to interpret `((Int, String))` as `(Int, String)`. It might be possible to support 1-tuples only in contexts where you&#39;re using a variadic tuple, but I&#39;m kind of skeptical of that idea.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Personally, I wish we&#39;d just acknowledge `(SomeType)` (or maybe `(SomeType, )`) as something different from `SomeType` and stop fretting. Sure, it&#39;s a semi-useless degenerate case, but so are one-case `enum`s and `Optional&lt;Void&gt;`s, and we don&#39;t ban those. Banning `T -&gt; U` syntax has already removed one of the sources of ambiguity here.<br></p><p>I agree that 1-ples would make a lot of things cleaner.

If we have &quot;tuple splatting&quot; for argument forwarding, and some support for iterating tuples, like we briefly discussed in the context of (4 x Int) fixed-sized homogeneous tuples, that&#39;d probably be enough.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I read the original proposal, started writing up a response along these lines, and then scrolled up to see what others had said. I&#39;m glad you agree!<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Here&#39;s my sketch.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * * *<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In general, my preferred direction for this feature would tie variadics closely to tuples, and variadic types closely to tuple types. To wit:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1. We should dust off the old tuple indexing proposal (I actually forgot it was never reviewed) and get it through, along with tuple `count`, `map`, and probably a few other Collection-like operations which generate fixed signatures. (I&#39;m going to use a method-style syntax, but a #function-style syntax would work too; we could even introduce a .#method-style syntax.)<br></p><p>Sounds like more compiler magic... rather than trying to reduce it.<br></p><p><br>&gt; <br>&gt;    let tuple: (Int, Int, Int, Int) = (2, 4, 6, 8)<br>&gt;    print(tuple[tuple.0])            // =&gt; 6<br>&gt;    print(tuple.map { $0 / 2 })    // =&gt; (1, 2, 3, 4)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2. We should allow you to use analogous operators on the type of a tuple, too.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    let value: (Int, String)[1] = &quot;Hello, world!&quot;<br>&gt;    (Int, String).map { $0.Type }        // =&gt; (Int.Type, String.Type)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 3. We should change our existing variadic parameters to create tuples, not Arrays.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    func print(_ items: (Any...), separator: String = &quot;&quot;, terminator: String = &quot;\n&quot;) {<br>&gt;        items.0    // Yes, that&#39;s a thing you can do<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 4. We should add a splat operator which unpacks tuples into (possibly variadic) parameters.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    print(tuple...)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 5. We should allow you to define variadic type parameters.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    // Note: If you had written `items: Items` instead of `items: Items...`, it would&#39;ve taken a tuple <br>&gt;    // of various LocalizedStringConvertible types.<br>&gt;    func localizedPrint&lt;Items: (LocalizedStringConvertible...)&gt;(_ items: Items..., separator: String = &quot;&quot;, terminator: String = &quot;\n&quot;) {<br>&gt;        print(items.map { $0.localizedDescription }, separator: separator, terminator: terminator)<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 6. We should extend splat to unpack tuple types into (possibly variadic) type parameters.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    typealias Pair = (String, Int)<br>&gt;    let table: Dictionary&lt;Pair...&gt; = [:]<br>&gt; <br>&gt; (7. Optional pet-peeve fixer, which I will not actually demonstrate: Require unconstrained type parameters to be spelled `T: Any`, not just `T`. This will remove an asymmetry, in that a variable-length tuple of any type has to be spelled `T: (Any...)`, but a single parameter is just spelled `T`.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What do we end up with here?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Zip:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    struct ZipSequence&lt;Sequences: (Sequence...)&gt;: Sequence {<br>&gt;        typealias Iterator: ZipIterator&lt;Sequences.map { $0.Iterator }...&gt;<br>&gt;        <br>&gt;        var sequences: Sequences<br>&gt;        <br>&gt;        func makeIterator() -&gt; ZipIterator&lt;Sequences...&gt; {<br>&gt;            return ZipIterator.init(sequences.map { $0.makeIterator() }...)<br>&gt;        }<br>&gt;        <br>&gt;        init(_ sequences: Sequences...) {<br>&gt;            self.sequences = sequences<br>&gt;        }<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt;    <br>&gt;    struct ZipIterator&lt;Iterators: (IteratorProtocol...)&gt;: IteratorProtocol {<br>&gt;        typealias Element = Iterators.map { $0.Element }<br>&gt;        <br>&gt;        var iterators: Iterators<br>&gt;        <br>&gt;        init(_ iterators: Iterators...) {<br>&gt;            self.iterators = iterators<br>&gt;        }<br>&gt;        <br>&gt;        mutating func next() -&gt; Element? {<br>&gt;            // Note: It may be too difficult to assign a type to this reduction;<br>&gt;            // something like the proposal&#39;s `#invert` may thus be necessary.<br>&gt;            // If it is added, I would hope that an analogous operation would <br>&gt;            // be added to `Sequence`s of `Optional`s.<br>&gt;            let nextValues = iterators.map { $0.next() }.reduce(Optional( () )) { earlier, this in<br>&gt;                guard let earlier = earlier, this = this else {<br>&gt;                    return nil<br>&gt;                }<br>&gt;                return earlier + (this)<br>&gt;            }<br>&gt;            guard let nextValues = nextValues else {<br>&gt;                return nil<br>&gt;            }<br>&gt;            return nextValues<br>&gt;        }<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Function application is basically just a use of the splat feature:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    // Note that the `args: Args` here is *not* `...`ed, so it takes a tuple.<br>&gt;    // Meanwhile, the `Args` in `(Args...) -&gt; Result` does have `...`, so it&#39;s looking <br>&gt;    // for arguments which that tuple could be splatted into.<br>&gt;    func apply&lt;Args: (Any...), Return&gt;(_ args: Args, to function: (Args...) -&gt; Return) -&gt; Return {<br>&gt;        return function(args...)<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt;    <br>&gt;    func method&lt;Instance, Args: (Args...), Return&gt;(_ name: String, on instance: Instance) -&gt; ((Args...) -&gt; Return)? {<br>&gt;        ...<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; MultiMap:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;    func multiMap&lt;Sequences: (Sequence...), Return&gt;(_ sequences: (Sequences...), transform: (Sequences.map { $0.Iterator.Element }...) -&gt; Return) -&gt; [Return] {<br>&gt;        var returns: [Return] = []<br>&gt;        <br>&gt;        // You could do this by manually making iterators, but why bother when we already have the right abstraction?<br>&gt;        for elems in zip(sequences...) {<br>&gt;            returns.append(transform(elems...))<br>&gt;        }<br>&gt;        <br>&gt;        return returns<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Advantages of this approach, as I see them:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * Variadics are entirely a creature of parameter lists and type parameter lists; outside of those, they are always represented as a tuple. That means, for instance, that there is no need for variadics to reach into places like variables.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * `...` goes in exactly two places: After a type name within the definition of a tuple type, and after an expression being splatted into a parameter list. There&#39;s no proliferation of dots throughout the language or confusing leading-vs.-trailing dots thing.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * Many of these features are useful in non-variadic code. For instance, Collection-like tuples are a feature people want already.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * We stick closer to already-implemented features, rather than inventing a whole lot of completely novel stuff, like `#rest` and `#fold` and `#vector`.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Disadvantages:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * This leans rather heavily on tuple and tuple type features which will probably, at least for now, have to be built into the compiler. (You might be able to make them macros later.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * This _may_ raise the grim specter of 1-tuples, but I&#39;m not sure about that. (Perhaps even the concrete-tuple members should be hashed, like `#count` and `#map`? That would allow them to be applied to single values.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Brent Royal-Gordon<br>&gt; Architechies<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>Variadic generics discussion</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>May 31, 2016 at 11:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Sounds like more compiler magic... rather than trying to reduce it.<br></p><p>Think of it this way: The amount of compiler magic should be at most proportional to the amount of utility granted by that magic.
