UnsafeRawBufferPointer would be in the lower right. But it would be nothing more than a raw pointer with length. It wouldn’t be a collection of anything. UnsafeBytes is a powerful abstraction on top of what we just called UnsafeRawBufferPointer. It is a collection of typed elements `UInt8`. But the memory access used to read or write those elements is untyped. It’s precisely for code that needs to stream bytes into or out of an object without thinking about binding memory to a type.<br></p><p>`bytes` is already our commonly used label for either untyped memory of UInt8 sized values, or for `UnsafeBufferPointer&lt;UInt8&gt;`. But these two things are frustratingly incompatible. `UnsafeBytes` is much more important than filling in that square in your matrix. It also does away with the now common, but incorrect use of `UnsafeBufferPointer&lt;UInt8&gt;` all over the place.<br></p><p>Look at the examples, imagine you’ve never heard of an UnsafeRawPointer, and see if you can come up with a better API.

UnsafeRawBufferPointer would be in the lower right. But it would be nothing more than a raw pointer with length. It wouldn’t be a collection of anything. UnsafeBytes is a powerful abstraction on top of what we just called UnsafeRawBufferPointer. It is a collection of typed elements `UInt8`. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But how is that different from UnsafeBufferPointer? Put another way, what is it about the UnsafeRawPointer -&gt; UnsafeBytes relationship that isn&#39;t true about UnsafePointer -&gt; UnsafeBufferPointer, and that therefore justifies the different name?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Giving UnsafeRawPointer a memory size doesn’t imply a collection of any specific type. You’re supposed to used bindMemory(to:capacity:) to get a collection out of it. Giving UnsafeBytes a name analogous to UnsafeBufferPointer only exposes that subtle difference, which is actually irrelevant. In the common case, users don’t need to know how UnsafeRawPointer works, so why start with that analogy?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The use cases justify the name. `UnsafeBytes` is what developers have been trying to get all along with `UnsafeBufferPointer&lt;UInt8&gt;`. The concept already exists to developers, but we have failed to give them a distinct, simple, and intuitive name for it, not to mention a correct implementation.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Andy<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160815/a86809d7/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f823d615b521ed15f1006b105c77900?s=50"></div><header><strong>[late pitch] UnsafeBytes proposal</strong> from <string>David Sweeris</string> &lt;davesweeris at mac.com&gt;<p>August 15, 2016 at 06:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Aug 15, 2016, at 13:55, Michael Ilseman via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; It seems like there’s a potential for confusion here, in that people may see “UInt8” and assume there is some kind of typed-ness, even though the whole point is that this is untyped.

Adjusting the header comments slightly might help:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; /// A non-owning view of raw memory as a collection of bytes.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ///<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; /// Reads and writes on memory via `UnsafeBytes` are untyped operations that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; /// do no require binding the memory to a type.

But, I don’t know if that’s getting too excessive.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too excessive at all. I might even go further and say that we should call it &quot;Untyped&quot; instead of &quot;Byte&quot;, to really drive home the point (many people see &quot;byte&quot; and think &quot;8-bit int&quot;, which is merely a side effect of CPUs generally not having support for types *other* than ints and floats, rather than a reflection of the true &quot;type&quot; of the data).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Dave Sweeris<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ‘Byte’ is sufficient, I think.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; In some sense, it is typed as bytes. It reflects the fact that anything that is representable to the computer must be expressible as a sequence of bits (the same way we have string de/serialisation — which of course is not to say that the byte representation is good for serialisation purposes). “withUnsafeBytes” can be seen as doing a reversible type conversion the same way LosslessStringConvertible does; only in this case the conversion is free.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Yes. Byte clearly refers to a value&#39;s in-memory representation. But typealias Byte = UInt8 would imply the opposite of what needs to be conveyed. The name Byte refers to raw memory being accessed, not the value being returned by the collection. The in-memory value&#39;s bytes are loaded from memory and reinterpreted as UInt8 values. UInt8 is the correct type for the value after it is loaded. Calling the collection’s element type Byte sends the wrong message. e.g. [Byte] or UnsafePointer&lt;Byte&gt; would be nonsense.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Keep in mind the important use case is code that needs to work with a collection of UInt8 values without knowing the type of the values in memory.

This proposal has `Unsafe` in its name because it’s not the final solution. It fills an important hole in these use cases—all of which currently interoperate with C—but leaves lifetime management of the memory on the table. It leaves the design of the marshalling feature up to the user intentionally because the primary goal is to migrate existing code. What you’re proposing is more of a new feature and less of a Swift 3 migration usability bug.<br></p><p>-Andy<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
