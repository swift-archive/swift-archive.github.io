Basically none of the index-based collection APIs<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (i.e. everything except `count` and `isEmpty`) make sense on sets and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; dictionaries.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Strongly disagreed.  Any read-only operation that makes sense on a<br>&gt;&gt; bidirectional collection makes sense on these data structures.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I don&#39;t see how the methods that impose meaning on the order of a set<br>&gt; are useful. What does mySet.prefix(upTo: i) mean when I have no<br>&gt; control or dependable way of knowing which elements lie between<br>&gt; startIndex and i? mySet.first is useful, but it&#39;s meaning is more like<br>&gt; NSSet&#39;s anyObject.<br></p><p>If you want to process the elements of your set in parallel, you want to<br>break it down into equally-sized regions and distribute the work across<br>cores.  That&#39;s indexing and slicing.<br></p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; index(where:) was marginally useful with dictionaries, but now that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Sequence is getting first(where:), née find(...), even that isn&#39;t<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; necessary.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;   s.remove(at: s.index(where: { $0 &lt; 1 }))<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Since Set&#39;s remove(at:) method is type-specific, it would need to be<br>&gt; rewritten as remove(where:). <br></p><p>That would mean “remove all elements satisfying this predicate,” to me.<br></p><p>&gt; This example is kind of my point, though - it removes the first<br>&gt; element less than 1, but only one such element, and there&#39;s no telling<br>&gt; which. That&#39;s not an operation I&#39;ve ever needed to perform on a set.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; To clarify, I don&#39;t think the current system is hurting Set and<br>&gt; Dictionary in any way. It&#39;s simply providing them with methods that<br>&gt; aren&#39;t very useful for that particular data structure.<br></p><p>I agree that because of Set&#39;s nature, some Collection algorithms are<br>less-applicable than they would otherwise be.  Does that mean Set isn&#39;t<br>fundamentally a Collection?  No it does not.  A Collection is a<br>multipass sequence with a representation of position.  Set definitely<br>has those properties.<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
