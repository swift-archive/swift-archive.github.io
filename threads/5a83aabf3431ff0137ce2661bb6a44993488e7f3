It also opens the door to implementing the same protocol with<br>different types, which is something that Swift does not currently allow.<br></p><p>I think Rust&#39;s trait system is a good example of the right way to do<br>this. Rust traits are like Swift protocols, but they started out with<br>only generics, no associated types. Later on they gained associated<br>types as well (with the same limitation that Swift protocols have,<br>where any trait with an associated type cannot be used as a &quot;trait<br>object&quot;). The end result is Rust traits can have both generics and<br>associated types, and the choice of which to use depends on what it&#39;s<br>for. Also, a type in Rust can implement the same trait with different<br>generic parameters (but for any parameterized trait, it can only have<br>one implementation regardless of associated types). This is also how<br>Rust has implemented multi-dispatch (Rust does not have method<br>overloading in general). And the way you&#39;re supposed to think about<br>this is generic type parameters to a trait are &quot;input types&quot;, and<br>associated types are &quot;output types&quot;. So any given type can implement<br>the same protocol as many times as it wants with distinct input types,<br>but for every set of input types, there is only one set of output<br>types. And this works very well.<br></p><p>An example of how this is used is the trait that powers the + operator,<br>called std::ops::Add. It&#39;s defined as<br></p><p>pub trait Add&lt;RHS = Self&gt; {    type Output;    fn add[1](self, rhs: RHS)<br>-&gt; Self::Output[2]; }<br></p><p>(the `= Self` bit is a defaulted type parameter)<br></p><p>This means that for any given type T, it can support addition with any<br>number of other types, but for every pair of types (T,U), the expression<br>`T + U` can only ever have one return value. To demonstrate how this<br>would work in Swift, you can imagine supporting `+` with NSNumber<br>against different numeric types:<br></p><p>extension NSNumber: Add&lt;Int&gt; {? ? typealias Output = Int? ? func<br>add(rhs: Int) -&gt; Int {? ? ? ? return integerValue + rhs? ? } }<br></p><p>extension NSNumber: Add&lt;UInt&gt; {? ? typealias Output = UInt? ? func<br>add(rhs: UInt) -&gt; UInt {? ? ? ? return unsignedIntegerValue + rhs? ? } }<br></p><p>// etc...<br></p><p>Besides the clean distinction between &quot;input&quot; and &quot;output&quot; types, this<br>also allows various traits to have only one or the other. For example,<br>Rust&#39;s equivalent to Swift&#39;s Generator is std::iter::Iterator, which has<br>an associated type for the iterated element. And it makes a lot of sense<br>for Iterator to use an associated type for this instead of a type<br>parameter, because it&#39;s confusing to have a sequence that can yield<br>multiple different element types from a call to `seq.generate()` (or in<br>Rust&#39;s case, `seq.iter()`) which would require an explicit type<br>annotation. And it&#39;s even worse when you realize that most code that<br>iterates over sequences doesn&#39;t even care about the concrete generator<br>type, but the type annotation requires declaring that concrete type (the<br>alternative, declaring it as `GeneratorType&lt;T&gt;`, will wrap the concrete<br>type in a protocol object and incur the overhead of extra allocation +<br>dynamic function dispatch if the optimizer can&#39;t remove it).<br></p><p>tl;dr: I want both type parameters and associated types for protocols<br></p><p>-Kevin Ballard<br></p><p>On Thu, Dec 3, 2015, at 02:39 PM, David Hart wrote:<br>&gt; I have been waiting a long time for something like this.

If you want to think about this more, some things you might consider:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; - What changes would be necessary to the standard library to make the most of this feature?
