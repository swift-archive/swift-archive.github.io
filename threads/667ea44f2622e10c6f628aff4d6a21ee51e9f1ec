Better reflection is something we&#39;d like to support eventually, and a lot of the necessary metadata is already present at runtime, but not exposed. Designing interfaces takes time, and there are also security and secrecy concerns regarding what ought to be reflected, so there needs to be language design as well to control what is available to runtime reflection. All that said, runtime reflection is not the only way to approach mocking and stubbing. Swift&#39;s as static as you write it; if you define your component interfaces using protocols and generics, those protocols can be conformed to with mock or stub implementations without any need for runtime hacking.<br></p><p>-Joe<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20151217/586301ea/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/edbd5f1c2f535b14165ae883fa7c3f37?s=50"></div><header><strong>Reason for Swift not having readwrite reflection</strong> from <string>Jens Alfke</string> &lt;jens at mooseyard.com&gt;<p>December 17, 2015 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Dec 17, 2015, at 10:54 AM, Gergely Orosz via swift-users &lt;swift-users at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Not having readwrite reflection makes it impossible to create any mocking frameworks for unit testing<br></p><p>I also strongly want reflection, but for a different purpose: data modeling. Core Data’s NSManagedObject is an example of what can be done with Objective-C: you just subclass it and add @property declarations, and the framework takes care of implementing those properties and backing them with data from a database. I happen to work on a different database (Couchbase Lite) that has a similar mechanism that uses the same Obj-C reflection capabilities. Our CBLModel class can be used in Swift since it inherits from NSObject, but in the long run I’d prefer to be able to do this with a pure-Swift class.<br></p><p>I’m glad to hear from Joe Groff that this is on the road-map. This would be a good topic to discuss on the swift-evolution list; swift-users seems more targeted at using Swift-as-it-is.<br></p><p>—Jens<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
