There&#39;s probably<br>more precedent for this syntax: sin!(x), but it will also clash in some<br>cases (optional function in objc protocol, optional closure).<br></p><p>I think something much more verbose (a function) would be fine as it&#39;s<br>probably not going to be called often.

Failing that a global clearly unsafe function:<br>unsafelyPurifyFunction(...).<br></p><p>With inout I don&#39;t think it is actually weaker, I could be wrong.

It covers so many non-trivial cases of<br>&gt; this feature.<br>&gt; I believe this is the archive of the other thread:<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160104/006005.html<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I was hesitant to add more to this discussion because I was only able to<br>&gt; think of the trivial case, and I know this can have lots of hidden<br>&gt; complexities and implications. Looking at Andrew&#39;s summary gave me some<br>&gt; ideas for talking points. Specifically, the section with inout parameters<br>&gt; and pure mutating functions seems strange to me as I wasn&#39;t expecting<br>&gt; mutation to occur, but this may be a valid scenario for &quot;weakly pure&quot;<br>&gt; functions, where parameters can be modified.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Chris had mentioned that there probably should be some way to to unsafely<br>&gt; &quot;force a call to a non-pure function to be allowed in a pure one,&quot; and that it<br>&gt; would probably make sense as an attribute @pure instead of a declmodifier.<br>&gt; Perhaps this is another form of &quot;weakly pure&quot; functions. I&#39;m thinking in<br>&gt; this case, pure is acting as a marker, the type system does not have to<br>&gt; know about actual purity and an effects system would not have to be<br>&gt; implemented in this case. This should make implementation simpler and less<br>&gt; invasive to the existing type system.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Imagine if ! was used to call an impure function within a pure function:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ```swift<br>&gt; /// Wrapper around C sin()<br>&gt; func sin(x: Double) @pure -&gt; Double {<br>&gt;     return sin(x)!<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In my mind, seeing ! tells me something could be wrong there so pay closer<br>&gt; attention. I would think `sin` is a C function so Swift doesn&#39;t know it<br>&gt; should be pure, but sine is a math function so it should be safe. What<br>&gt; about for actually impure functions? Optionals and try! crashes when<br>&gt; expectations are not met. Should `potentiallyImpureFunc()!` or<br>&gt; `mostlyPureFunc()!` crash if an &quot;impure&quot; value or side effect occurs? How<br>&gt; would the runtime know this if purity is defined by annotations? Maybe it<br>&gt; shouldn&#39;t crash, but now ! is slightly different from optionals and try!.<br>&gt; Perhaps there should be a different symbol for &quot;unwrapping&quot; impure<br>&gt; functions. Then there would be two different symbols for unwrapping.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; My major concern is I&#39;d want to avoid a situation where developers are<br>&gt; adding @pure and unwrapping impure functions just to make their app<br>&gt; compile, making @pure meaningless since most of their pure functions will<br>&gt; actually be impure.

The function must have a return value<br>&gt;    2. This function can only call other pure functions<br>&gt;    3. This function cannot access/modify global or static variables.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ```swift<br>&gt;<br>&gt; func pure getDate() -&gt; NSDate {<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     return NSDate.date() // Error: pure function &#39;getDate&#39; cannot call<br>&gt; impure function &#39;date&#39;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This would be similar to the pure keyword in D (<br>&gt; https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#pure-functions) or the noSideEffect<br>&gt; pragma in Nim (<br>&gt; http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#pragmas-nosideeffect-pragma).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; My motivation for this is that I want to create applications that follow a<br>&gt; &quot;Functional Core, Imperative Shell&quot; style [Gary Bernhardt]. By marking all<br>&gt; of my functions within the functional core as pure, the compiler can help<br>&gt; me if I accidentally start writing impure functions. In theory, this should<br>&gt; make my application simpler and more testable. Reviewing pull requests will<br>&gt; also be simpler since in the functional portion of my codebase, checking<br>&gt; for pure can be a criteria. Ideally, I&#39;d run a static analyzer to see that<br>&gt; I have more pure functions than impure ones, which should help me control<br>&gt; complexity by encouraging me to have a larger &quot;value&quot; layer and smaller<br>&gt; &quot;object&quot; layer [Andy Matuschak].<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Logically, I think of this as Swift having all functions return<br>&gt; &quot;Implicitly Impure Values&quot; (similar to how every object from objective-c is<br>&gt; an implicitly unwrapped optional). All existing Swift functions are<br>&gt; actually returning a IO&lt;SomeType&gt;, and functions using that are implicitly<br>&gt; unwrapping them. Swift can be super nice by hiding this fact, making the<br>&gt; language much more familiar and accessible to developers not used to<br>&gt; purity. Adding `pure` allows devs to tap into the compiler&#39;s power and<br>&gt; prevent unwanted side-effects without directly exposing the IO type.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The benefits I see are:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - Explicit intentions - This allows design decisions to be<br>&gt;    communicated clearly to other developers and maintainers, as well as the<br>&gt;    compiler and other static analysis tools.<br>&gt;    - Compile-time guarantee - The compiler can help prevent unintentional<br>&gt;    state modifications.<br>&gt;    - Encouragement of better state management practices - More people<br>&gt;    will be aware of the concept of functional purity and may try to design<br>&gt;    their code to have more pure functions, which should make more code simpler<br>&gt;    and testable. This isn&#39;t a guarantee it will happen, but more people should<br>&gt;    understand it if it brings concrete results instead of just being an<br>&gt;    abstract concept.<br>&gt;    - Reduced cognitive load when understanding code - More pure functions<br>&gt;    should make it easier to reason about code.<br>&gt;    - Opt-in to purity - Swift will be just as accessible to new<br>&gt;    developers, but experienced developers will be able to take advantage of<br>&gt;    this.<br>&gt;    - Backwards compatible (mostly) - Existing codebases should still<br>&gt;    compile without any change (unless pure was used as a variable/method/class<br>&gt;    name).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Of course, there are risks of this feature. Some of the risks include:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - This could make the language more difficult to work with. Developers<br>&gt;    maintaining an existing codebase with lots of pure function may become<br>&gt;    confused or frustrated when they realize they cannot do easy things such as<br>&gt;    logging within the method.<br>&gt;       - A counterargument to this may be that when Swift was introduced,<br>&gt;       optionals also made the language difficult to use. People implicitly<br>&gt;       unwrapped them just so things will compile, or returned them from methods<br>&gt;       without much consideration to what that implies. Nevertheless, this made<br>&gt;       Swift a safer language to use by explicitly when nil is a possible value.<br>&gt;       Developers are more conscious about nil being a potential value. Similarly,<br>&gt;       I think developers should be more aware about side-effect causing<br>&gt;       functions. Being clear about this and separating these concerns should<br>&gt;       bring about more safer and testable Swift applications.<br>&gt;    - Implementation of this feature could be difficult. Swift can<br>&gt;    implement it in several different ways depending on the desired result of<br>&gt;    this feature, such as having stronger or weaker purity guarantees to make<br>&gt;    the feature easier to use or simpler to implement. An effect system may<br>&gt;    have to be created.<br>&gt;       - Alternatively, this could be done in a lightweight manner where<br>&gt;       the feature is introduced and known &quot;pure-like&quot; functions are marked<br>&gt;       in swift-corelibs-foundation.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; To be honest, I don&#39;t have much experience in languages that have this<br>&gt; feature. I would imagine many people are interested in the notion of pure<br>&gt; functions, but the question here is if it would be worth it, feasible, or<br>&gt; even aligned with Swift&#39;s goals to have this feature. I&#39;m half-expecting<br>&gt; that this has already been brought up and determined to be out of scope or<br>&gt; not a good idea.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Thanks for your consideration.

By marking all of my functions within the functional core as pure, the compiler can help me if I accidentally start writing impure functions. In theory, this should make my application simpler and more testable. Reviewing pull requests will also be simpler since in the functional portion of my codebase, checking for pure can be a criteria. Ideally, I&#39;d run a static analyzer to see that I have more pure functions than impure ones, which should help me control complexity by encouraging me to have a larger &quot;value&quot; layer and smaller &quot;object&quot; layer [Andy Matuschak].<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Logically, I think of this as Swift having all functions return &quot;Implicitly Impure Values&quot; (similar to how every object from objective-c is an implicitly unwrapped optional). All existing Swift functions are actually returning a IO&lt;SomeType&gt;, and functions using that are implicitly unwrapping them. Swift can be super nice by hiding this fact, making the language much more familiar and accessible to developers not used to purity. Adding `pure` allows devs to tap into the compiler&#39;s power and prevent unwanted side-effects without directly exposing the IO type.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The benefits I see are:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Explicit intentions - This allows design decisions to be communicated clearly to other developers and maintainers, as well as the compiler and other static analysis tools.<br>&gt; Compile-time guarantee - The compiler can help prevent unintentional state modifications. <br>&gt; Encouragement of better state management practices - More people will be aware of the concept of functional purity and may try to design their code to have more pure functions, which should make more code simpler and testable. This isn&#39;t a guarantee it will happen, but more people should understand it if it brings concrete results instead of just being an abstract concept.<br>&gt; Reduced cognitive load when understanding code - More pure functions should make it easier to reason about code. <br>&gt; Opt-in to purity - Swift will be just as accessible to new developers, but experienced developers will be able to take advantage of this.<br>&gt; Backwards compatible (mostly) - Existing codebases should still compile without any change (unless pure was used as a variable/method/class name).<br>&gt; Of course, there are risks of this feature.
