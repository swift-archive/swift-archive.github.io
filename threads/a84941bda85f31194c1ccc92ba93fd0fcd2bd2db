They&#39;re a<br>&gt; well-received feature, but they introduce a lot of surprising behavior, and<br>&gt; introduce opportunity for subtle bugs. We didn&#39;t have time to put much<br>&gt; diagnostic work in last year, but now that users have had time to work with<br>&gt; the feature, we have evidence of some of the more surprising and<br>&gt; problematic behavior. Among the most common things we&#39;ve seen reported:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A) When a protocol requirement has an extension implementation requirement<br>&gt; available, we&#39;ll silently ignore when a conforming type attempts to conform<br>&gt; to the protocol but misses, by type or spelling:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; protocol Channel {<br>&gt;   func receive() -&gt; NSData<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; extension Channel {<br>&gt;   func receive() -&gt; NSData { return NSData() }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; // Silently fails to replace the default implementation:<br>&gt; struct ClumsyChannel: Channel {<br>&gt;   // Wrong spelling<br>&gt;   func recieve() -&gt; NSData { return NSData(bytes: &quot;oops&quot;, length: 4) }<br>&gt;   // Wrong return type<br>&gt;   func receive() -&gt; [UInt8] { return Array(&quot;whoopsie&quot;.utf8) }<br>&gt;   // Wrong throwiness<br>&gt;   func receive() throws -&gt; NSData { throw &quot;doh&quot; }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; B) Protocol requirements aren&#39;t real class members, and can&#39;t be<br>&gt; overridden by subclasses unless the base class satisfies the requirement<br>&gt; with one of its own methods rather than with a protocol extension method,<br>&gt; but we silently allow subclasses to shadow:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; class BaseChannel: Channel { } // gets default imp from extension<br>&gt;<br>&gt; class SubChannel: BaseChannel {<br>&gt;   // Doesn&#39;t &#39;override&#39; protocol requirement; silently shadows it<br>&gt;   func receive() -&gt; NSData { return NSData(bytes: &quot;oof&quot;, length: 3) }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; C) Similarly, protocol extension methods aren&#39;t protocol requirements, so<br>&gt; extension methods that don&#39;t match a requirement can&#39;t be specialized in a<br>&gt; way available to generic code, but we silently allow concrete type<br>&gt; implementations to shadow:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; extension Channel {<br>&gt;   func receiveAsString() -&gt; String {<br>&gt;     return String(data: receive(), encoding: NSUTF8Encoding)<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; struct StringyChannel {<br>&gt;   func receive() -&gt; NSData { return NSData(bytes: &quot;data&quot;, 4) }<br>&gt;   // Does not affect generic code calling receiveAsString<br>&gt;   func receiveAsString() -&gt; String { return &quot;string&quot; }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; func foo&lt;T: Channel&gt;(chan: T) {<br>&gt;   print(chan.receiveAsString())<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; foo(StringyChannel()) // Prints &quot;data&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (B) and (C) could be mitigated by shadowing warnings, and we&#39;ve also<br>&gt; floated ideas for making them behave as intended, by implicitly forwarding<br>&gt; protocol requirements into class methods to address (B) and/or introducing<br>&gt; dynamic dispatch for protocol extensions to address (C). (A) is a bit<br>&gt; trickier, since with overloading it&#39;s tricky to divine whether a<br>&gt; declaration was really intended to match another one with a different type<br>&gt; in isolation. We&#39;ve discussed a couple approaches to this problem:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - Adopting an explicit &#39;implements&#39; modifier, in the spirit of &#39;override&#39;,<br>&gt; to mark a declaration as being intended to fulfill a requirement. This adds<br>&gt; boilerplate we&#39;d like to avoid, and also interferes with retroactive<br>&gt; modeling.<br>&gt; - Encourage &quot;one extension per conformance&quot; style, where each protocol<br>&gt; conformance&#39;s requirements are defined in a dedicated extension. We can<br>&gt; then warn about any declarations in an extension that don&#39;t satisfy a<br>&gt; requirement:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; struct InconsistentChannel {}<br>&gt;<br>&gt; extension InconsistentChannel: Channel {<br>&gt;   func receive() -&gt; NSData { ... } // OK<br>&gt;   func recieve() -&gt; NSData { ... } // Warning: Declaration in conformance<br>&gt; extension doesn&#39;t satisfy any requirements from &#39;Channel&#39;<br>&gt;   func receive() -&gt; NSData? { ... } // Warning<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; There are likely others too. It&#39;d be great if we could give users better<br>&gt; guidance about this feature.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -Joe<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160310/ef1ef587/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Completing Generics] Completing protocol extension diagnostics</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>March  9, 2016 at 07:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; For type A problems: why not require that you annotate with overload?<br></p><p>This is basically the same thing as the suggestion to use `implements`, except that `override` (which I assume is what you meant) is not really accurate since you only override inherited methods.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10d0339242a000b0b683ed1d5e25a110?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Completing Generics] Completing protocol extension diagnostics</strong> from <string>Howard Lovatt</string> &lt;howard.lovatt at gmail.com&gt;<p>March 10, 2016 at 03:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Yes.
