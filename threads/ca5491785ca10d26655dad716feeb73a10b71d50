I came up with two different solutions: <br></p><p>    let result = withUnsafePointer(to: &amp;addr) {<br>        connect(sock,<br>                UnsafeRawPointer($0).assumingMemoryBound(to: sockaddr.self),<br>                socklen_t(MemoryLayout&lt;sockaddr_in&gt;.stride))<br>    }<br></p><p>or<br></p><p>    let result = withUnsafePointer(to: &amp;addr) {<br>        $0.withMemoryRebound(to: sockaddr.self, capacity: 1) {<br>            connect(sock, $0, socklen_t(MemoryLayout&lt;sockaddr_in&gt;.stride))<br>        }<br>    }<br></p><p>which both compile and run correctly.<br></p><p>My questions are:<br>- Are both solutions correct, should one be preferred, or are both wrong?<br>- Can the same be achieved simpler?<br></p><p>Thanks,<br>Martin<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2bc666e29724cd3bdf46b6cbbe4a07bb?s=50"></div><header><strong>Pointer conversions between different sockaddr types</strong> from <string>Quinn &quot;The Eskimo!&quot;</string> &lt;eskimo1 at apple.com&gt;<p>August 18, 2016 at 08:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>On 17 Aug 2016, at 18:55, Martin R via swift-users &lt;swift-users at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; - Are both solutions correct, should one be preferred, or are both wrong?<br></p><p>Your `withMemoryRebound` solution is correct.<br></p><p>&gt; - Can the same be achieved simpler?<br></p><p>Not without introducing a layer of abstraction.<br></p><p>In my case I introduced an abstract `Address` type (basically a wrapper around `sockaddr_storage`) and then added a method to that object which calls a closure with the right parameters (actually, multiple such methods, depending on whether I’m calling something like `connect` which takes an address, or `getpeername`, which returns one).
