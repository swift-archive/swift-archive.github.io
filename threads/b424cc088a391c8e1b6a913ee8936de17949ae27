A rep at Apple told me that she knew of ONE school that was definitely teaching this material…of course it is out of my state and I cannot afford to go there, not even for 1 class to learn what I seek.

I chose to learn to develop for iOS for particular reasons, and now at the end of school, I’m about to graduate without having been taught an obviously vital skill that a developer should absolutely posses.<br></p><p>The vital skill a developer should absolutely possess is being able to sit down and—through reading, experimenting, debugging, Googling, and discussing specifics with more experienced developers—figure out how something works.<br></p><p>I&#39;m sorry if this comes off as unfriendly, but you can&#39;t expect your classes to teach you every single API you&#39;ll ever use. Many are obscure. Many are on different platforms. Many have not even been designed yet. Learning new technologies is a vital—indispensable—skill every programmer needs to have. If you haven&#39;t started to acquire that skill, it&#39;s time you get to it.<br></p><p>That&#39;s not to say that we can&#39;t help you, but you&#39;re going to need to get a lot more specific. You say you&#39;re getting a bunch of errors? Well, pick one of them and try to figure out what&#39;s causing it. If you have no idea, put the error message into Google and see what it says. If you still can&#39;t figure it out, post here or on Stack Overflow, providing the exact error message and the snippet of code it&#39;s happening in. (Not the whole file, just the few lines around the line with the error, and anything else you think we might need to see to understand them.)<br></p><p>If you think the problem is more conceptual—if you feel like the issue is not with the exact code you&#39;ve written, but rather that you have no idea how in-app purchase is supposed to work—then take a step back from your code and look for samples, tutorials, or books on the subject. Apple might not have anything specifically for in-app purchases (or their sample might be in Objective-C), but I&#39;m sure somebody does. Don&#39;t read them to find code to copy; read them to understand how they work. And then once you do understand, bring that understanding back to your code.<br></p><p>But the most important part is an attitude change. Development is not a mechanical skill; your job is not merely to do the specific programming tasks you&#39;ve been taught, but also to figure out how to perform new tasks—perhaps even tasks *nobody* has ever done before. Writing code that uses this API is not your teacher&#39;s job, or DTS&#39;s job, or this mailing list&#39;s job. It&#39;s *your* job.<br></p><p>The rest of us are here to help, but this is the job you signed up for. Roll up your sleeves and get to work.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
