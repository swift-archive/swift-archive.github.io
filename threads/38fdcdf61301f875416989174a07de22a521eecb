The contents of the skipped comments (e.g. whether they include newlines) should have no effect on this determination.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; For this purpose, slash-slash comments should be treated as extending up to but not including the trailing newline character (if present). So, for example, this should be treated as a postfix &quot;~&quot; operator:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let a = foo~// comment<br>&gt; bar()<br>&gt; The newline character after the end of the comment means the &quot;~&quot; has whitespace to its right, not bar. On the other hand, this should be parsed as a binary operator:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let a = foo~/* commment<br>&gt; */bar()<br>&gt; As the newline appears only within the comment. (Note that this only matters for operators other than &quot;!&quot; and &quot;?&quot; because of their special rules.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The language reference should also be updated to make clear that comments are ignored for these purposes.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;  &lt;https://github.com/jder/swift-evolution/blob/comments-and-operators/proposals/0000-clarify-comments-and-operators.md#impact-on-existing-code&gt;Impact on existing code<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Only code with comments immediately next to operators will be affected. This is not expected to be very common, and could be fixed by adding/removing whitespace or moving the comment outside of the expression. It would probably be possible to produce fix-its for these. Here are some examples of the changes.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Some cases which would previously work will now produce an error (these are breaking changes):<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1 /* */+2<br>&gt; 1 +/* comment */2<br>&gt; 1+/*comment*/ 2<br>&gt; Some cases which were previously errors will now work:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; /* */!foo<br>&gt; !/* */foo<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1+/* */2<br>&gt; 1 /**/+ 2<br>&gt; Examples of things which will continue to be errors:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1/**/+ 2<br>&gt; 1 +/*comment*/2<br>&gt; And things which will continue to work:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; foo!// comment<br>&gt; foo/* */?.description<br>&gt; foo/* */!<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1 +/**/ 2<br>&gt; 1/**/+2<br>&gt; 1+/**/2<br>&gt;  &lt;https://github.com/jder/swift-evolution/blob/comments-and-operators/proposals/0000-clarify-comments-and-operators.md#alternatives-considered&gt;Alternatives considered<br>&gt; <br>&gt;  &lt;https://github.com/jder/swift-evolution/blob/comments-and-operators/proposals/0000-clarify-comments-and-operators.md#treat-comments-as-whitespace&gt;Treat comments as whitespace<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We could instead specify that comments are treated as whitespace. This is a simpler rule, and it avoids some extra complications described above around slash-slash comments and multi-line slash-star comments. It is also easier for both the lexer and a human reader to determine whether an operator is binary or not, since if comments are always whitespace, you don&#39;t have to scan to the other side of a long comment to tell whether an operator has whitespace around it. For example:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1 +/* a very long comment */2<br>&gt; With the proposed changes, you can&#39;t tell just by looking near the “+” whether it is a binary or prefix operator. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; On the other hand, this goes against the common mental model that comments are ignored when parsing. As a result, this is somewhat more surprising rule. This rule is also less flexible; that is, there are places which this completely prohibits comments which are permitted by the above proposal. (e.g. !/* */foo)<br>&gt; <br>&gt;  &lt;https://github.com/jder/swift-evolution/blob/comments-and-operators/proposals/0000-clarify-comments-and-operators.md#a-more-general-rule&gt;A more general rule<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Another alternative is a more general rule about how comments are handled everywhere in the language (e.g. there must be no effect when replacing a comment with a space character). This has the advantage of possibly resolving other ambiguities, but has potentially far-reaching consequences in various edge cases which are hard to fully enumerate (e.g. multi-line comments, comments within interpolated sequences inside of string literals, comments in lines which contain &quot;#&quot; directives, etc).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Owen Zhao<br>&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160109/c68f4d88/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04a3fc14ec0008acf8d406c93e23c3ae?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Draft] Clarify interaction between comments &amp; operators</strong> from <string>Jesse Rusak</string> &lt;me at jesserusak.com&gt;<p>January  9, 2016 at 08:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Thanks both of you for your positive feedback.
