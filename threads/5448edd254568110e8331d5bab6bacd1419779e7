Ninja is significantly faster than other build options, so we&#39;re not going to drop support for it. It sounds like we might need better failovers when Ninja isn&#39;t available, though.<br></p><p>-Joe<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecb50a99bf3b4cc0249312945dce7115?s=50"></div><header><strong>Support only ninja built from source</strong> from <string>Ben Langmuir</string> &lt;blangmuir at apple.com&gt;<p>March 14, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Mar 14, 2016, at 2:21 AM, Wojciech Czekalski via swift-dev &lt;swift-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This is a humble proposal (or rather thought) to drop support for ninja which does not come from source.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This is motivated by two things:<br>&gt; 1.
