This would convey that no<br>&gt; MemoryLayout instances do or can exist.<br></p><p>+1.<br></p><p>&gt; However, I&#39;m also not really a fan of the way this<br>&gt; reads. `MemoryLayout&lt;Int&gt;` is an unnatural way to access this<br>&gt; functionality, quite different from how generics are typically<br>&gt; used. The heavy use of type members, with instance behavior as a<br>&gt; complete afterthought, is very unusual. If we are serious about use<br>&gt; sites being the most important thing, we ought to be concerned about<br>&gt; these use sites.<br></p><p>This design is specifically optimized to make use-sites clear and<br>noise-free.<br></p><p>The fact that using the type as a generic parameter very clearly states<br>that we&#39;re asking about the size of the type, and not the metatype, also<br>helps.<br></p><p>Lastly, any other design is more verbose, requiring &quot;.self&quot; on the<br>passed metatype.<br></p><p>&gt; I would prefer to see an instance-centric version of this design, with use sites along the lines of:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 	MemoryLayout(of: Int.self).size<br>&gt; 	let buffer = UnsafeRawPointer.allocate(bytes: MemoryLayout(of: Int.self).stride * count)<br></p><p>I don&#39;t think that objectively reads better than:<br></p><p> 	let buffer = UnsafeRawPointer.allocate(bytes: MemoryLayout&lt;Int&gt;.stride * count)<br></p><p>I can understand your preference for it as a matter of taste, but I<br>think the second one is just as understandable and much less<br>noisy... thus clearer.<br></p><p>&gt; If the problem is that it would sometimes misbehave—for instance, when<br>&gt; someone tries to construct a MemoryLayout instance from a `type(of:)`<br>&gt; call—then we should make it behave correctly, or at least consider it<br>&gt; a bug to be fixed eventually.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (Incidentally, I notice that the ABI documentation lists the size,<br>&gt; alignment, and stride as part of the type&#39;s value witness<br>&gt; table. &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/ABI.rst#common-metadata-layout&gt;<br>&gt; Would it make sense to think of this as exposing the value witness<br>&gt; table as a user-visible type? <br></p><p>Definitely not.<br></p><p>&gt; How might that be different from what&#39;s being proposed here?)<br></p><p>This is stable, documented API; the value witness table is not. :-)<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes. We need to lock this down.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; See my comment above about how it reads.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Well, it *is* more coherent and less magical than the C family.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Quick reading, but I&#39;ve chimed in during previous discussions (though not in this latest round—family duties have kept me from my mail client).<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5451f7df31d36d0159a018706aec7adb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review #2] SE-0101: Reconfiguring sizeof and related functions into a unified MemoryLayout struct</strong> from <string>Erica Sadun</string> &lt;erica at ericasadun.com&gt;<p>July 18, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jul 13, 2016, at 5:39 PM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; on Wed Jul 13 2016, Brent Royal-Gordon &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; I think grouping these into a type is a sensible approach, but I don&#39;t<br>&gt;&gt; like that it allows the creation of meaningless MemoryLayout<br>&gt;&gt; instances.
