Letting value types conform to @objc protocols and have @objc methods would be especially empowering for Cocoa APIs. There are some subtleties—many ObjC protocols are *intended* to be class-constrained, particularly delegate protocols, and these protocols also tend to be used as weak references and other concepts that only really make sense for classes. Your point (4) also raises a question of whether Swift value types ought to be exposed to ObjC in their boxed or unboxed forms; it seems to me that there are many structs that you&#39;d want to export back to C or ObjC as plain structs and not boxed objects. We&#39;re also still researching the backward compatibility ramifications of changing the bridging model. While at face value, these ought to be additive changes, since we&#39;re turning purportedly opaque ObjC objects into meaningful ones, and relaxing generic constraints, the fact of the matter is people can and do rely on implementation details that are supposed to be private and subject to change. I&#39;m hopeful we can explore this model going forward, though.<br></p><p>-Joe<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
