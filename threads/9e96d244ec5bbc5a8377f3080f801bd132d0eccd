We will also be landing some source changes on both master and the swift-3.0-preview-3-branch.  These changes include updates required for the SDK update for Swift 3, as well as reverting some changes from the swift-3.0-preview-3-branch that were backed out in the process of converging and qualifying the preview branch.  (Those changes will remain on master, and will be rolled into the swift-3.0-preview-4-branch when it is cut.)  We expect the upgrade process to take several hours.  Weâ€™ll send out a message when the upgrade is complete.<br></p><p>At this time, we will also be cutting a swift-3.0-preview-4-branch.<br></p><p>As a reminder, once the upgrade is complete, if you are doing development on a Mac, the minimum required Xcode to build Swift from source will be the latest Xcode 8 beta.  The latest Xcode 8 beta can be downloaded at: https://developer.apple.com/download/ &lt;https://developer.apple.com/download/&gt;<br></p><p>Thanks!<br>Nicole<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160718/9e96eccd/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
