It&#39;s a limitation of the language today that you need to provide default implementations outside the protocol in an extension, which is an unfortunate bit of boilerplate, but we hope to improve that. Any sort of useful mixin-like thing still needs to be based on a common protocol that types adopting the mixin must conform to, so I can&#39;t see it being usefully different from protocols with default implementations.<br></p><p>&gt; The downside is this isn&#39;t a true mixin implementation as typically Mixins allow you to specific properties. <br></p><p>There&#39;s a proposal in another thread to remove this restriction. You might contribute to that discussion if you haven&#39;t already.<br></p><p>-Joe<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc3a9ea0c6c870343d9acb4ac3059cdc?s=50"></div><header><strong>Mixins</strong> from <string>Matthew Johnson</string> &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt;<p>December 23, 2015 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>I obviously don&#39;t know what the original poster intended but the most common definitions I have seen are:<br></p><p>Trait: Protocols with default implementations for some method requirements.<br>Mixin: Traits with stored properties.<br></p><p>Sent from my iPhone<br></p><p>&gt; On Dec 23, 2015, at 1:57 PM, Joe Groff via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Dec 23, 2015, at 11:54 AM, James Campbell via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Mixins would be a great addition instead of having to define a protocol and then extending it<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Mixins are a vague term.
