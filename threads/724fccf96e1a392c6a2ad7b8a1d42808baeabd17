I extracted the list of method definitions from my app and looked through it.<br></p><p>The overwhelming majority of my methods either take no arguments, or start with a verb and make a phrase where the first parameter doesn’t require a label (rule B1).<br></p><p>Some methods I noticed (I don’t know if this is useful for you, but if it is then here you go):<br></p><p>	private func setHandoffState(hash hash: String, fallbackURL: String, title: String? = nil, searchable: Bool) {<br></p><p>This seems OK to me, but I’m not entirely sure if the guidelines suggest I _should_ put a preposition there, i.e.<br></p><p>	setHandoffStateFor(hash: a, fallbackURL: b, …)<br></p><p>I don’t think I should — I don’t see how “for” adds to clarity here, but I want to make sure if I interpret the proposed guidelines right.<br></p><p>	func actionForCommand(command: UIKeyCommand) -&gt; String? {<br></p><p>This should become “actionFor(command: c)” — which isn’t an obvious win, but I certainly don’t mind it.<br></p><p>	private func createAttribute(tag: SecItemAttr, _ data: NSString?) -&gt; SecKeychainAttribute? {<br></p><p>Forgive my barbaric removal of external labels. It should be `createAttribute(tag: t, data: d)`. Alternatively, it could be `attributeFor(tag: t, data: d)` — I could go either way.<br></p><p>(adding to my thoughts on the later proposal of moving preposition inside parens, the symmetry in param labels would likely be broken here, because it doesn’t seem necessary to add “for”/“with” when I go with “createAttribute”, but for the noun-only version it would have to be “attribute(forTag: t, data: d)”.)<br></p><p>	func attachmentForImage(image: UIImage) throws -&gt; Attachment {<br>	func attachmentForData(data: NSData) -&gt; Attachment {<br>	func attachmentForFileURL(url: NSURL) throws -&gt; Attachment {<br></p><p>This should be `attachmentFor(image:)`, `attachmentFor(data:)`, and `attachmentFor(fileURL:)`. This seems like a win, since related methods for different data types are grouped more tightly together. (I could also — like you suggested about not optimizing for method families — make an enum, but it would be overkill since it’s not API for public consumption. I should mark those as private.)<br></p><p>	private func messageCell(label label: String) -&gt; MessageCell {<br>	private func cellForTask(task: Task, enabled: Bool = true) -&gt; TaskCell {<br></p><p>Hm, those are inconsistent. I could go with `cellFor(message:)` and `cellFor(task:)`, which would be consistent with the guidelines. OTOH, since they return different types, I liked that they had different names… `taskCellFor(task:)` is redundant. Perhaps `taskCellFor(_:)` and `messageCellFor(_:)`.<br></p><p>	func generate(fill: Double, text: String) -&gt; CLKComplicationTemplate {<br></p><p>`templateFor(fill:, text:)`<br></p><p>	func update(from old: TaskCommentRowModel?, to new: TaskCommentRowModel) {<br></p><p>That’s the, IMO rare, circumstance where the preposition *does* make sense to go inside the parens.<br></p><p>* * *<br></p><p>I mentioned this in some other post before, but I also found a bunch of methods where the first parameter should be labeled, but isn’t, because without an easy shortcut like the old #param, I was just too lazy to do The Right Thing.<br></p><p>PS.

It maybe is not common. But we’re not always able to write a perfect test suite that makes refactoring an always successful trial and error process.

With Xcode, a serious tool that deserves consideration as much as critics, the only pragmatic way to invoke a function using several lines is the following:<br></p><p>	attachmentFor(<br>	    image: …,<br>	    extraParam: ….)<br></p><p>Oh, and this is not an edge case. Just look at UIView animation methods.<br></p><p>Gwendal<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160211/5bd4364d/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0089229ece6e648767cff4dc6c6d38ab?s=50"></div><header><strong>When to use argument labels, part DEUX</strong> from <string>Charles Kissinger</string> &lt;crk at akkyra.com&gt;<p>February 11, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Feb 11, 2016, at 4:02 AM, Gwendal Roué via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>[snipped]<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If such convention were to be adopted, we could throw away our favorite grep tools.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Functions with many parameters are often more legible when their invocation is split across several lines. And generally speaking, a developer can liberally call a function on a single line, or on several lines:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	attachmentFor(image: …, extraParam: …)<br>&gt; 	attachmentFor(<br>&gt; 	    image: …,<br>&gt; 	    extraParam: …)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; OK so now if I want to look for all invocations of attachmentFor(image:extraParam:) in my code, I have to look for &quot;attachmentFor&quot;, and get all the unrelated results attachmentFor(data:…), attachmentFor(fileURL:…), etc.<br></p><p>The “Find&gt;References” function in Xcode will let you specifically find functions like these that differ only in their parameter labels. As I mentioned earlier in this thread, if you’re on Linux or just using different tools, you’re right: it does become a difficult problem to do it reliably.<br></p><p>—CK<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; Whereas if the function were named attachmentForImage(_:extraParam:), I could look for &quot;attachmentForImage&quot;, and get much more precise search results.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; So… I’m happy people discuss how nice `attachmentFor(image:)` looks, and my opinion on how nice or ugly it looks is not my point. My point is that I want my tools to help me doing my job.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Gwendal<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
