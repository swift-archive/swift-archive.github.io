It&#39;s my understanding that the portability that is targeted is core Swift, not so much Obj-C interoperability.<br></p><p>That said, there are a few people working on Swift for MSVC, and Swift already works with Cygwin.  Someone has considered making Swift work with an open source implementation of the Obj-C libraries (I don&#39;t think it was GnuSTEP), but I haven&#39;t heard from them in quite a while.<br></p><p>I hope that helps.<br>- Will<br></p><p>&gt; On May 12, 2016, at 8:42 AM, Michael Peternell via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hi,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;ve seen on the swift-evolution git repository README.md page that Portability is one of the design goals for Swift 3.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Does this mean that Swift 3 will be available and useful on Windows too?
