Moreover, it is all too easy to accidentally type “assert” when you mean “precondition”.<br></p><p>Here’s some rationale that may be missing.  The two functions have distinct roles:<br></p><p>- assert: checking your own code for internal errors.<br>- precondition: for checking that your clients have given you valid arguments.<br></p><p>It’s actually important to distinguish these two cases because the second one demands public documentation while the first does not.<br></p><p>For example: in Swift’s standard library we promise never to allow memory errors unless you call (Obj)C code or use an explicitly labeled “unsafe” construct.  On the occasions where we need to do a check on the client’s parameters to avoid causing a memory error when we’re given invalid arguments, we document the requirements on the arguments as a precondition, and use (our equivalent of) precondition() to check it.  We also have a bunch of internal sanity checks to make sure our assumptions about our own code, where the type system doesn’t already guarantee them, are correct.  For those, we use (our equivalent of) assert(), because we don’t want to slow down *your* code as an artifact of our development process (the use of sanity checks).<br></p><p>Here are a couple of concrete examples:<br></p><p>/// A collection whose elements are all identical `Element`s.<br>public struct Repeat&lt;Element&gt; : CollectionType {<br>  ...<br>  /// Access the element at `position`.<br>  ///<br>  /// - Requires: `position` is a valid position in `self` and<br>  ///   `position != endIndex`.<br>  public subscript(position: Int) -&gt; Element {<br>    _precondition(position &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; position &lt; count, &quot;Index out of range&quot;)<br>    return repeatedValue<br>  }<br>}<br></p><p>extension String.UTF8View {<br>  ...<br></p><p>  private func _encodeSomeContiguousUTF16AsUTF8(i: Int) -&gt; (Int, UTF8Chunk) {<br>    _sanityCheck(elementWidth == 2)<br>    _sanityCheck(!_baseAddress._isNull)<br></p><p>    let storage = UnsafeBufferPointer(start: startUTF16, count: self.count)<br>    return _transcodeSomeUTF16AsUTF8(storage, i)<br>  }<br>}<br></p><p>In the first example, we have a precondition that the client doesn’t index past the end of the collection.  In this case we’re not strictly bound to check it because we’re not avoiding a memory error,* but we do check it as a service to our clients; it will help them find their bugs sooner.<br></p><p>In the second example, this is a private function that is meant to be called only on a code path where we’ve ensured elementWidth == 2 and _baseAddress is not null (_sanityCheck is the stdlib’s equivalent of assert).  That is in fact how it is being used, but we want to ensure that ongoingly.  For example, we don’t want someone to add code later that uses it incorrectly. Since we run our tests in both debug and release and we have decent test coverage, the assertions are very likely to fire if that should happen.<br></p><p>You might think from the above that assert() only gets used in private methods and precondition() only gets used in public methods, but that’s not the case; you could inline any private method into the body of the public method it implements, and doing sanity checks there would still make sense.  Precondition checks occasionally appear in private methods, too.  The simplest example is where duplicated precondition checking code is factored out of a bunch of public methods and into a single private helper. <br></p><p>Hope this helps,<br>Dave<br></p><p>*  Note that some preconditions actually can’t be checked, so having a rule that all preconditions must be checked isn’t tenable.<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151214/a1cc1b3b/attachment-0001.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f822334c2f6ebeafd3a41cd44c82a62b?s=50"></div><header><strong>Proposal: remove &quot;assert&quot; and always use &quot;precondition&quot; instead.</strong> from <string>Andrey Tarantsov</string> &lt;andrey at tarantsov.com&gt;<p>December 15, 2015 at 04:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Here’s some rationale that may be missing.

It&#39;s very easy to accidentally expose class internal details and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then call class elements that are meant to be used only inside the class.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Having a keyword for class internals will allow the compiler to ensure that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only the public API for the class is used from the outside world. The user<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can check types on his own, but it&#39;s better that the compiler does it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; automatically. Similarly, the user can check that only the proper APIs are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; called, but it&#39;s better that the compiler does it automatically.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) accessibility by file structure may cause some really short files.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) It&#39;s impossible to group related classes in one file but still<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hide implementation details inside each class<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I think that it the best solution is to make private keyword do what<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it states -- keep the class element private to the class. But if it&#39;s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really important to have a separate keyword for backward compatibility, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be the next best thing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But on the flip side, with your proposed semantics for private, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be impossible to write a group of related types, functions, and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extensions that do need to refer to each other’s internal details without<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exposing those details to the entire module.  That’s not really acceptable.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Swift language rule encourages you to put independent definitions<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in different files.  That definitely means that, if you want to enforce<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very tight separation of concerns, you’ll end up with more and smaller<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; files.

It&#39;s very easy to accidentally expose class internal details and then call class elements that are meant to be used only inside the class. Having a keyword for class internals will allow the compiler to ensure that only the public API for the class is used from the outside world. The user can check types on his own, but it&#39;s better that the compiler does it automatically. Similarly, the user can check that only the proper APIs are called, but it&#39;s better that the compiler does it automatically.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) accessibility by file structure may cause some really short files.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) It&#39;s impossible to group related classes in one file but still hide implementation details inside each class<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I think that it the best solution is to make private keyword do what it states -- keep the class element private to the class.

That’s not really acceptable.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Swift language rule encourages you to put independent definitions in different files.

Right now, the only way to hide implementation details for a class is to hide the class code in a separate file, which is very inconvenient for several reasons:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 1) the meaning of the code changes depending on which file the class is in. It&#39;s very easy to accidentally expose class internal details and then call class elements that are meant to be used only inside the class. Having a keyword for class internals will allow the compiler to ensure that only the public API for the class is used from the outside world. The user can check types on his own, but it&#39;s better that the compiler does it automatically. Similarly, the user can check that only the proper APIs are called, but it&#39;s better that the compiler does it automatically.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) accessibility by file structure may cause some really short files.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) It&#39;s impossible to group related classes in one file but still hide implementation details inside each class<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I think that it the best solution is to make private keyword do what it states -- keep the class element private to the class.

It&#39;s very easy to accidentally expose class internal details<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and then call class elements that are meant to be used only inside the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class. Having a keyword for class internals will allow the compiler to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ensure that only the public API for the class is used from the outside<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; world. The user can check types on his own, but it&#39;s better that the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compiler does it automatically. Similarly, the user can check that only the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; proper APIs are called, but it&#39;s better that the compiler does it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; automatically.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) accessibility by file structure may cause some really short<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; files.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) It&#39;s impossible to group related classes in one file but still<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hide implementation details inside each class<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I think that it the best solution is to make private keyword do<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what it states -- keep the class element private to the class. But if it&#39;s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really important to have a separate keyword for backward compatibility, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be the next best thing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But on the flip side, with your proposed semantics for private, it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be impossible to write a group of related types, functions, and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extensions that do need to refer to each other’s internal details without<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exposing those details to the entire module.  That’s not really acceptable.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Swift language rule encourages you to put independent definitions<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in different files.

The current model is simple to describe and implement. It’s a good solution for access control across modules. That being said, it doesn’t solve the problem of hiding implementation details at a smaller scale, which is also important. The suggestion to put each class (or part of the class) in a separate file works for large pieces of code but isn’t practical for smaller pieces. An analogy: putting each chapter of a book into a separate file makes sense but putting every paragraph in a separate file does not.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that Matthew had a great idea: add a scope based access control. Swift already has some support for it: local functions. I actually use it a lot and put functions into other functions to hide implementation details. It’s not possible to use it everywhere, but when it is possible, it’s great. If we could have a “local” access modifier that limited the entity only to the scope in which it’s defined, that would allow much less nesting, and it would make it possible to hide many more code.structures.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; For me, hiding implementation details is a fundamental feature of the language / compiler. It is possible to get by without it with coding by convention, but it’s also possible to get by without a strong type system. Having a way to hide implementation details that is enforced by the language will help to have clearly defined interfaces and limit hacks and mistakes for misusing APIs that are meant to be private.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I appreciate what you said about an official proposal. I’ll ask Matthew again (since access by scope was his idea). If he is not up to it, I’ll submit a proposal myself.

The purpose of access control is to make sure implementation details stay hidden from other parts of the program. If you&#39;re in the same file, you&#39;re not in another part of the program.

You can even add extensions for the sole purpose of accessing these members, and therefore there&#39;s no protection at all.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t submit a proposal officially to the swift-evolution repo, or even that it won&#39;t get reviewed.

If it is extended further I would like to see any enhancements follow the same scope-driven strategy rather than being type-driven as is seen in other languages.  Proposals along these lines might be interesting to consider and might be able to accomplish what you are hoping to accomplish while affording additional flexibility.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In a language where distributing the implementation of a type across several extensions sometimes in different files a type-driven access control model doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to me.  I think it has a lot of potential to be confusing.  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; What would it mean to limit access to a member to the type itself in Swift?  Would an extensions in the same (or different) files be able to see the member?  What about extensions in a different module?  And what about subclasses? Subclasses probably wouldn&#39;t have visibility to them, but any discussion of something like this will probably lead to discussion of protected as well.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Sent from my iPad<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Dec 7, 2015, at 7:45 AM, Ilya via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Also, one problem with the current approach is that it&#39;s all or nothing.
