Would you like to see Swift to be ISO compliant? <br>&gt;&gt; Then you could throw away perhaps more than half the language constructs<br>&gt;&gt; currently present in Swift?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; @Chris:  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; is there a desire/requirement to make Swift ISO compliant? <br>&gt;&gt; and thus therewith restricting Swift’s flexibility? If so, to what extent? <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; This is orthogonal to the discussion at hand.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; As long as data loss is an &quot;unintended&quot; effect of a certain class of coercions, I don&#39;t believe it deserves to be implicit.  If you &quot;know what you&#39;re doing&quot;, the preference so far has been to tell the compiler that and use the constructors provided in the Swift Standard Library to perform explicit truncation.  Even in C, if you can be more specific with a cast in cases where you intend data loss, you probably should be.<br>&gt;&gt; With all due respect, Robert, Imho, I find this all too theoretical and bureaucratic and tons of unnecessary overhead. <br>&gt;&gt; and I am telling the compiler implicitly: <br>&gt;&gt; aFloat = anInt  // The compiler will use a builtin function to do the conversion. what can be wrong with that? <br>&gt;&gt; Again, in the cases I mentioned there is no data loss.

If it is too technical and bureaucratic to insert casts to make your intent clear in either language (rather than what I assume is just silencing -Wconversion), I’ll take bureaucracy and safety over convenience please.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ~Robert Widmann<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ~Robert Widmann<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2016/03/30 13:57、Ted F.A. van Gaalen &lt;tedvgiosdev at gmail.com &lt;mailto:tedvgiosdev at gmail.com&gt;&gt; のメッセージ:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you, Robert &amp; Haravikk<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please allow me to respond in-line hereunder, thanks.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ted.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On 30.03.2016, at 16:15, Haravikk &lt;swift-evolution at haravikk.me &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at haravikk.me&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I’m in favour of implicit conversion for integers where no data can be lost (UInt32 to Int64, Int32 to Int64 etc.), in fact I posted a similar thread a little while ago but can’t find it; there’s something being done with numbers so this may be partly in the works.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I definitely think that implicit conversion for floating point should be avoided, as it can’t be guaranteed<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why?  and   What cannot be guaranteed? <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; except in certain edge cases; for example, Javascript actually technically uses a double for all of its numeric types, effectively giving it a 52-bit (iirc) integer type,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; awful, didn’t know that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so in theory conversion of Int32 to Double is fine, and Int16 to Float might be as well, but I’m not certain if it’s a good idea or not, as it’s not quite the same as just extending the value.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It simply would cause a float with less precision as an integer like <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 10000 -becomes e.g - 9999.999999, (depending on magnitude, of course) <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but that is normal in a floating point domain; E.g.  also with: <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      var v:Double  = 10000.0       //   Double to Double <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; v would have the same imprecision… and could be anywhere between 9999.9998…10000.00001  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (rough estimation, depending on magnitude and the floating point type used) <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On 30 Mar 2016, at 14:57, Developer via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What you describe, all those cases where one fixes losing precision by simply &quot;ignoring it&quot;, that&#39;s part of why I&#39;m hesitant about simply throwing in C-like promotion rules into any language.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; E.g. if I assign an Int to a Double, then I know very well what I am doing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  often occurring simple example here:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	for i in 0..&lt;10<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                 dTemperature = dInterval * i         / /   Double = Double * Int  (not possible yet in Swift)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                foo(dTemperature)  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;          }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       Here I still have to write:     <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                    dTemperature = dInterval * Double(i)       <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       However, Swift will accept: <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                    dTemperature = dInterval * 3        // 3 inferred to Double. could be regarded as an implicit conversion? <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Once you add implicit type coercions, even just between integer or floating point types, your language gains a hundred unspoken rules<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Could you please explain these “unspoken rules” you mention more in detail?  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and little guard rails you have to cling to lest you slip and hit the next pitfall.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am counting on the average intelligence of programmers.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Though you may be dismissive of information loss, it is a serious issue in coercions, and one with implications that are never completely grokked by experts<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In practice, the implications/effects/behavior of a programming language <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cannot be fully predicted and understood, there are simply too many possibilities, <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Functional Programming attempts to solve this, trying to make/do everything mathematically <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correct but fails for the aforementioned reason.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and serve as yet another hindrance to novices trying to adopt the language. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don’t agree here. Even novices should have a good understanding <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the basic data types of a programming language,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also note that  concepts of integer, natural, rational, irrational numbers etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is very basic mathematics as learned in high school. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or your country’s equivalent education. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So aDouble = anInt  should -in the programmer’s mind- <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appear as an explicit conversion, that is, he/she should realize the consequences. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The same applies also doing it explicitly like so:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      aDouble = Double(anInt)    <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Same effect: even a fool can use this as well and not knowing the implications.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I don&#39;t think coercion under this scheme is the complete end-all-be-all solution to this problem, [though it may certainly feel right].  Sure, it is always defined behavior to &quot;downcast&quot; a value of a lower bitwidth to one of a higher bitwidth, but to dismiss Int -&gt; Float, Float -&gt; Int,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wrote that I don’t want implicit conversion for Float -&gt; Int. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and Double -&gt; Float, etc. coercions as mere trifles is an attitude I don&#39;t want enshrined in the language&#39;s type system.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Could you give me an example where Double -&gt; Float is problematic (apart from loosing precision) ? <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps there is a middle ground.  Say, one could declare conformance to a special kind of protocol declaring safe implicit convertibility (see: Idris&#39; solution of having an `implicit` conversion mechanism).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please spare me from this kind of contraptions.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   -=side note: =-<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for bringing Idris to my attention.

If so, to what extent? <br>&gt; <br>&gt; This is orthogonal to the discussion at hand.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; As long as data loss is an &quot;unintended&quot; effect of a certain class of coercions, I don&#39;t believe it deserves to be implicit.  If you &quot;know what you&#39;re doing&quot;, the preference so far has been to tell the compiler that and use the constructors provided in the Swift Standard Library to perform explicit truncation.  Even in C, if you can be more specific with a cast in cases where you intend data loss, you probably should be.<br>&gt;&gt; With all due respect, Robert, Imho, I find this all too theoretical and bureaucratic and tons of unnecessary overhead. <br>&gt;&gt; and I am telling the compiler implicitly: <br>&gt;&gt; aFloat = anInt  // The compiler will use a builtin function to do the conversion. what can be wrong with that? <br>&gt;&gt; Again, in the cases I mentioned there is no data loss.

Even novices should have a good understanding <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the basic data types of a programming language,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also note that  concepts of integer, natural, rational, irrational numbers etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is very basic mathematics as learned in high school. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or your country’s equivalent education. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So aDouble = anInt  should -in the programmer’s mind- <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appear as an explicit conversion, that is, he/she should realize the consequences. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The same applies also doing it explicitly like so:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      aDouble = Double(anInt)    <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Same effect: even a fool can use this as well and not knowing the implications.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I don&#39;t think coercion under this scheme is the complete end-all-be-all solution to this problem, [though it may certainly feel right].  Sure, it is always defined behavior to &quot;downcast&quot; a value of a lower bitwidth to one of a higher bitwidth, but to dismiss Int -&gt; Float, Float -&gt; Int,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wrote that I don’t want implicit conversion for Float -&gt; Int. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and Double -&gt; Float, etc. coercions as mere trifles is an attitude I don&#39;t want enshrined in the language&#39;s type system.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Could you give me an example where Double -&gt; Float is problematic (apart from loosing precision) ? <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps there is a middle ground.

Even novices should have a good understanding<br>&gt; of the basic data types of a programming language,<br>&gt; Also note that  concepts of integer, natural, rational, irrational numbers<br>&gt; etc.<br>&gt; is very basic mathematics as learned in high school.<br>&gt; or your country’s equivalent education.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So aDouble = anInt  should -in the programmer’s mind-<br>&gt; appear as an explicit conversion, that is, he/she should realize the<br>&gt; consequences.<br>&gt; The same applies also doing it explicitly like so:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;      aDouble = Double(anInt)<br>&gt; Same effect: even a fool can use this as well and not knowing the<br>&gt; implications.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So, I don&#39;t think coercion under this scheme is the complete<br>&gt; end-all-be-all solution to this problem, [though it may certainly *feel*<br>&gt; right].  Sure, it is always defined behavior to &quot;downcast&quot; a value of a<br>&gt; lower bitwidth to one of a higher bitwidth, but to dismiss Int -&gt; Float,<br>&gt; Float -&gt; Int,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I wrote that I don’t want implicit conversion for Float -&gt; Int.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; and Double -&gt; Float, etc. coercions as mere trifles is an attitude I don&#39;t<br>&gt; want enshrined in the language&#39;s type system.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Could you give me an example where Double -&gt; Float is problematic (apart<br>&gt; from loosing precision) ?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Perhaps there is a middle ground.

Even novices should have a good understanding <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the basic data types of a programming language,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also note that  concepts of integer, natural, rational, irrational numbers etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is very basic mathematics as learned in high school. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or your country’s equivalent education. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So aDouble = anInt  should -in the programmer’s mind- <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appear as an explicit conversion, that is, he/she should realize the consequences. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The same applies also doing it explicitly like so:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      aDouble = Double(anInt)    <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Same effect: even a fool can use this as well and not knowing the implications.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I don&#39;t think coercion under this scheme is the complete end-all-be-all solution to this problem, [though it may certainly feel right].  Sure, it is always defined behavior to &quot;downcast&quot; a value of a lower bitwidth to one of a higher bitwidth, but to dismiss Int -&gt; Float, Float -&gt; Int,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wrote that I don’t want implicit conversion for Float -&gt; Int. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and Double -&gt; Float, etc. coercions as mere trifles is an attitude I don&#39;t want enshrined in the language&#39;s type system.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Could you give me an example where Double -&gt; Float is problematic (apart from loosing precision) ? <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps there is a middle ground.  Say, one could declare conformance to a special kind of protocol declaring safe implicit convertibility (see: Idris&#39; solution of having an `implicit` conversion mechanism).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please spare me from this kind of contraptions.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   -=side note: =-<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for bringing Idris to my attention.

The Integers prototype that Dave and Max have been working on (test/Prototypes/Integers.swift.gyb) starts to move in this direction by allowing heterogeneous integer types in shifts and comparisons.  This is a great approach because it eliminates the need for conversion entirely, rather than making them implicit.  Shifts and comparisons cover a large portion of the cases where the need for conversions is most painful, and this doesn’t introduce risk because the result type and value are clearly and unambiguously defined by the values involved (and the lhs type for shifts).<br></p><p>– Steve<br></p><p>PS: personally as someone who has a firm grasp of low-level numerics, I find the need for explicit conversions annoying, but it’s only a very minor annoyance, and I appreciate the safety that it provides for users who wisely don’t want to waste mental capacity on the precise details of numeric ranges and conversions.  On balance I think requiring them to be explicit is a significant win.<br></p><p>I would also be remiss if I didn’t observe that excessive conversions, implicit or explicit, are a significant performance hazard.  Even in the best-case scenario, they often require a sign- or zero-extension instruction.  They may also involve testing for out-of-range values and trapping, or (as with unsigned integer to floating-point on x86) a sequence of several instructions.
