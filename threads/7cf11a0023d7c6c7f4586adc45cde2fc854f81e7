We obviously could have parallel folders as well to host different translations.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#39;s also the question of how we allow users to select a language on the website.  Perhaps we would want to the most-likely language choice based on browser preferences, but I&#39;m not sure.  Maybe it&#39;s simple to just default to English, make it obvious on the landing page that alternate translations are available, and then allow them to select that to get a different URL that indicates the rest of the content is a different translation.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Thoughts?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Ted<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jan 16, 2016, at 11:33 PM, John Lin &lt;johnlinvc at gmail.com &lt;mailto:johnlinvc at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Ted,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift.org &lt;http://swift.org/&gt; has updated several times since I started the translation. The part that changes most frequently is the download page. I’ve made a script to auto update these download links. For other text updates, whenever I translate a page, I alway keep the origin English copy so that I can track the changes in the future.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think keeping the translation up-to-date will be easier if the site&#39;s source is open. Currently I use page2rss &amp; IFTTT to get notifications about changes, but if the source is open, we can track these changes on GitHub.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I’m more than happy to contribute these translations back to Swift.org &lt;http://swift.org/&gt;, but maybe the site structure will need some changes to accommodate translations in various languages.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Best,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; John<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jan 16, 2016, at 3:56 PM, Ted kremenek &lt;kremenek at apple.com &lt;mailto:kremenek at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi John,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think we would be open to having the community help host translations on Swift.org &lt;http://swift.org/&gt;.  My primary concern is maintenance.  The material on the site will continue to evolve.  What did you have in mind in terms of keeping the translation up-to-date?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Note if the translation was on Swift.org &lt;http://swift.org/&gt;, from a legal perspective we&#39;d consider it to be an open source contribution.  The website material is hosted on GitHub.  We were planning on opening it up once a few more logistical rollout issues were settled.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ted<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jan 11, 2016, at 9:45 PM, John Lin via swift-dev &lt;swift-dev at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-dev at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I’m working on a traditional Chinese translation of Swift.org &lt;http://swift.org/&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://swiftlang.tw &lt;https://swiftlang.tw/&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First, will there be any legal issue?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Second, is it possible to add the translation to the official Swift.org &lt;http://swift.org/&gt; ?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; John Lin<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-dev mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-dev at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-dev at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-dev &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-dev&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160121/ba61ad6f/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
