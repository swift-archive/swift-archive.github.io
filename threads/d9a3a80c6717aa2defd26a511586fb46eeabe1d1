The reason to do this is that<br>&gt; ideally StdlibCore would not have any code specific to ObjC in<br>&gt; it. This is a small step that we can take in this direction by moving<br>&gt; the public API of AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer to the ObjC<br>&gt; overlay. <br></p><p>+1<br></p><p>To avoid confusion among reviewers, I feel I need to point out that<br>everything below this point is implementation detail that IMO has no<br>relevance to the evolution list.<br></p><p>&gt; The way that this would be done is that the implementation<br>&gt; for AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer would remain in StdlibCore, but<br>&gt; we would add an underscore to make that API private to the standard<br>&gt; library. Then inside the ObjC overlay, we would create a typealias to<br>&gt; the internal API with the non-underscored name (i.e. make the<br>&gt; typealias the public API). Then at a later point in time we can move<br>&gt; the implementation. The reason why I am not proposing to move the<br>&gt; implementation today is that there are dependencies in Array/Hashed<br>&gt; Collections on AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer. Moving that code is<br>&gt; a larger project that is preconditioned on this proposal going in<br>&gt; first as an incremental step.<br></p><p>I am not confident that we will ever be able to move that code, but as I<br>said before, that&#39;s really irrelevant here.  Let&#39;s do it!<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
