A required initializer is one that will be invoked on an unknown subclass of the type, as in the instantiateModelObject method above. That means that it must be present on all subclasses, because it’s generally impossible to prove that a particular subclass will not be passed to instantiateModelObject.<br></p><p>Swift currently doesn’t allow this at all, but we could imagine making it a run-time error instead of a compile-time error, i.e. if instantiateModelObject is called on a class that doesn’t provide its own implementation of init(context:), the program would trap. That’d be giving up some compiler-provided safety for run-time flexibility, which can certainly be desirable.<br></p><p>However, this is just the tip of the iceberg. In the implementation of the subclass, there has to be a call to one of the superclass&#39;s initializers. If all of the superclass’s initializers are non-public, then there’s no way to write your own initializer. (This is actually true in Swift today.) This isn’t quite the same as sealed-by-default because the subclass could just inherit the superclass’s initializers, but it’s very close: the only way to instantiate such a class would be through a required initializer, which you couldn’t customize.<br></p><p>In that sense, Swift already has something very similar to sealed-by-default, which just doesn’t work very well in the particular use case where you also need to use dynamic initialization.<br></p><p>Jordan<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160710/c919bde4/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/831ba6eb600af4a6587f263373921bb2?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Tino Heth</string> &lt;2th at gmx.de&gt;<p>July 11, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; In the implementation of the subclass, there has to be a call to one of the superclass&#39;s initializers.
