I’ve made the mistake of trying to do this with some of my code and it’s remarkably painful for what I’d hoped would be a simple abstraction.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right now (pre SE-0067), it takes a surprising amount of tinkering to get code to work generically across those two types.  Provisions need to be added to provide `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, etc.  While it all compiles down to the same instructions, I don’t feel it is natural to call `squareRoot()` as a method.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don’t necessarily care if these functions are in the global namespace, or if they’re imported from a `Math` module.  I’m also not convinced that they should be part of the core FloatingPoint protocol.  `sqrt` probably should be, but the trig functions would naturally fit together in a protocol that itself conforms to FloatingPoint.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jul 11, 2016, at 14:28 , Stephen Canon via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Post SE-0067 FloatingPoint provides the usual global operators, as well as a single global function:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	func sqrt&lt;T: FloatingPoint&gt;(_: T) -&gt; T<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems out of place and lonely, and it would be nice if we can keep the default members of the global namespace to a minimum.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I’d like to suggest removing this global from FloatingPoint while keeping the existing global functions for concrete types in the Darwin.C module.
