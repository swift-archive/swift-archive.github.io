When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to<br>&gt; answer in your review:<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;       * What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt; &gt;       * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a<br>&gt; change to Swift?<br>&gt; &gt;       * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt; &gt;       * If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar<br>&gt; feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt; &gt;       * How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick<br>&gt; reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;       https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Thank you,<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; -Chris Lattner<br>&gt; &gt; Review Manager<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; &gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; &gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>-- <br>Best,<br></p><p>Arthur / Sabintsev.com<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160325/5a3887e2/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/05e222e6ef4d84013bb3baeb0e25c90b?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0053 Remove explicit use of let from Function Parameters</strong> from <string>Patrick Gili</string> &lt;gili.patrick.r at gili-labs.com&gt;<p>March 26, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>Given var has been removed and inout has been moved, forcing developers to specify let seems redundant, and hence I support the proposal.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Redundancy is as bad as inconsistency.
