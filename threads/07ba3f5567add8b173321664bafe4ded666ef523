This would have a similar purpose,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; but would be 3 lines only - Title (link to mailing list archive of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; discussion), Description (one-line), Status/comment.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Pros and Cons are basically the same as 1.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Add a separate category to the bug tracker for proposals.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Pros: ?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Cons: ?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Not sure how that&#39;s currently used, or if mixing up dev and evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; related items is acceptable or not, so I&#39;m not sure if this is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; viable/practical.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160928/0a733903/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>draft proposals should be easier to find</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>September 28, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Sep 28, 2016, at 8:34 AM, Jay Abbott via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I don&#39;t really understand this concept of only accepting proposals for a specific round.
