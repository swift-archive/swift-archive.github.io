If I declare a<br>method on my type that matches a protocol extension method, it is *not*<br>safe to assume I was trying to override the (non-overridable) method.<br>It&#39;s very likely that I&#39;m simply providing a specialization of the<br>method that will be called by anyone who&#39;s working with my type directly<br>(with the acknowledgement that working with the type generically won&#39;t<br>call my type&#39;s version). Not only that, but it&#39;s not even possible by<br>looking at the definition of the protocol to determine if any given<br>method I add to my type will even trigger a warning! The warning will be<br>triggered by the existence of any visible extension to the protocol,<br>even one the programmer isn&#39;t aware of.<br></p><p>I think a much better approach to handling this is simply to update the<br>documentation to make it much more obvious which methods/properties are<br>&quot;part of&quot; the protocol and which are extensions. The current stdlib docs<br>(in the iOS Developer Library) adds the text &quot;Default implementation&quot;<br>next to any default method, but it doesn&#39;t actually separate out the<br>default implementations from the required ones. This also means that<br>when Xcode shows the method list in the documentation viewer there&#39;s no<br>indication as to which ones are default and which are not.<br>http://swiftdoc.org provides a *much* better display where &quot;Instance<br>methods&quot; are in a separate section from &quot;Default Implementations&quot; (see<br>http://swiftdoc.org/v2.1/protocol/SequenceType/ for an example).<br></p><p>-Kevin Ballard<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160102/b06828cc/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
