I am finding that in Swift’s POP idiom, protocols<br>&gt; with overrides are serving very nearly the same purpose that overrides were<br>&gt; serving in the old design; hence, I don’t really think either is more or<br>&gt; less dangerous than the other.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt;<br>&gt; protocol MyProtocol {<br>&gt;     func myMethod() -&gt; String<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; class MyClass: MyProtocol {<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     *conform* func myMethod() -&gt; String {<br>&gt;         return &quot;Yuhuuu,I am conforming \\o//&quot;<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     func whatever() {<br>&gt;         print(&quot;I am a boring method and I don&#39;t conform anything&quot;)<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It would be something similar to the current keyword `override` but for<br>&gt; protocols.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Apart from improving code readability, It would allow the detection, in<br>&gt; compilation time, of errors due to code evolution. For example redundant<br>&gt; methods that no longer conform anything once the requirement is removed<br>&gt; from the protocol for whatever reason.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If you make a breaking change to a protocol like this, you should have<br>&gt; gone through a deprecation cycle to indicate to your clients the<br>&gt; appropriate changes you&#39;re going to make to the protocol.  This aspect of<br>&gt; the change seems to if not encourage, highlight, bad behavior.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What if it’s your own code and all the callers are internal? What if<br>&gt; you’re still developing the protocol and haven’t released the API interface<br>&gt; yet?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Then your concerns are local enough that you know where *all* implementations<br>&gt; of the protocol lie and whether they require deletion or not.  The point<br>&gt; about deprecation cycles still stands in all the cases you mention.  Just<br>&gt; because the interface is private doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t take responsibility<br>&gt; for keeping it as clean as you can.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Charles<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; tl;dr It seems like all of this can be subsumed by us warning about dead<br>&gt; code.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Did you look at my examples earlier in the thread? Neither of those would<br>&gt; be caught by warning about dead code.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The example involving the default implementation is most compelling, but<br>&gt; it indicates that your proposed solution should focus on the protocol<br>&gt; extension and not the implementing declaration.  Perhaps reusing one of our<br>&gt; existing keywords can help here<br>&gt;<br>&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt;   func foo() {}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; extension P {<br>&gt;   default func foo() {}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; struct S: P {}<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Of course, this change would be potentially source-breaking either way - I<br>&gt; don&#39;t like the sound of an &quot;optional keyword”.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I can come up with a similar example without the mistake being in the<br>&gt; extension, though:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt; func foo() {}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; extension P {<br>&gt; func foo() { print(“Default Behavior”) }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; struct S: P {<br>&gt; func foo() { print(“Specific Behavior”) }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So far, so good. But now I realize that the original protocol needs an<br>&gt; argument:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt; func foo(bar: String) {}<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; extension P {<br>&gt; func foo(bar: String) { print(“Default Behavior; bar is \(bar)”) }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; struct S: P {<br>&gt; func foo() { print(“Specific Behavior”) } // Whoops, forgot to update this<br>&gt; method, and now it won’t get called—and we of course won’t see the<br>&gt; carnage until runtime.<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Either way, we can all agree we need better diagnostics around these cases.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; No doubt.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Charles<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160825/0649a58d/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fab081724d16d497369e46fe76f20e12?s=50"></div><header><strong>Keyword for protocol conformance</strong> from <string>Charles Srstka</string> &lt;cocoadev at charlessoft.com&gt;<p>August 25, 2016 at 10:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Is there a reason that adding a “retro” keyword on extensions meant to retroactively apply a protocol is unacceptable?<br></p><p>Charles<br></p><p>&gt; On Aug 25, 2016, at 6:44 PM, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Chris, as I wrote above, this idea has been discussed previously on several occasions, and the principal reason why it has been abandoned each time is that it cannot accommodate retroactive modeling.

The intentions of an empty extension that does nothing but conform to a protocol is actually quite clear; the methods have to be already declared somewhere else, or it makes no sense. At any rate, the “problem” in your scenario is entirely confined to File B, so if any annotations are necessary, that is where they belong. File A does not know about the protocol, it does not know that it is conforming to the protocol, and indeed, the protocol is none of File A’s business.

There&#39;s enormous flexibility there, and none of it impacts people who have retroactive modeling needs that don&#39;t neatly fit into this sort of &quot;comes before&quot; and &quot;comes after&quot; model.<br></p><p>The idea of having to have *comments* be meaningful on protocols just to get the same kind of checking you’d get with inheritance or even procedural code, via a linter that does not and probably never will exist, seems incredibly distasteful.<br></p><p>At this point, I feel like Swift should stop advertising itself as a “protocol-oriented” language, when designing around protocols loses so much safety compared to older patterns. :-/<br></p><p>Charles<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160827/f0aba7a1/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0a5152b275c43b493a94b5a6a868905?s=50"></div><header><strong>Keyword for protocol conformance</strong> from <string>Pyry Jahkola</string> &lt;pyry.jahkola at iki.fi&gt;<p>August 26, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Hi Xiaodi and Charles,<br></p><p>&gt; As I said, this discussion has already happened several times. I&#39;m literally just repeating what people said eight months ago, six months ago, and four months ago. There&#39;s not a good answer to this and perhaps several other issues, which is why I don&#39;t see a way forward for the proposal. After all, I was the one proposing the same idea last winter, so I&#39;ve had a few months to think about it.<br></p><p><br>I&#39;ve been following the discussion from the side both now and before. Without being able to cover everything that&#39;s been said, I hope this message brings at least a bit of new air into the discussion.<br></p><p>— — —<br></p><p>Here&#39;s one more approach that, AFAICT, would enable both retroactive modelling and fairly good error diagnostics: bring the full protocol conformance together with a dedicated definition block which can both define implementations and refer to implementations defined elsewhere.<br></p><p>Details:<br></p><p>1. Allow marking the conformance to a given protocol with a block of code. This could be nested inside a struct/enum/class body or its extension:<br></p><p>    struct Vector {<br>      conformance Hashable { /* TBD, read on… */ }<br>    }<br>    extension Vector {<br>      conformance CustomStringConvertible { /* … */ }<br>    }<br></p><p>or at the top level, as a clearly marked single-conformance extension:<br></p><p>    conformance Vector : CustomDebugStringConvertible { /* … */ }<br></p><p>2. Inside the body of that block, all protocol (non-extension) methods must be marked with `override`. That includes both the required interface and the customisable interface with library-provided default implementations:<br></p><p>    struct Vector {<br>      conformance Hashable {<br>        override static func ==(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -&gt; Bool { /* … */ }<br>        // Ok.<br></p><p>        var hashValue: Int { /* … */ }<br>        // error: property &#39;hashValue&#39; is required by Hashable.<br>        // (Fixit: mark with &#39;override&#39;)<br></p><p>        override static func &lt; (lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -&gt; Bool { /* … */ }<br>        // error: protocol Hashable does not require &#39;static func &lt;&#39;.<br>        // (Fixit #1: remove override. Etc.)<br>      }<br>    }<br></p><p>3. When conformance is made explicit as described above, no other part of code is allowed to interfere with that type&#39;s conformance to the protocol under question:<br></p><p>    conformance Vector : Collection {<br>      override var startIndex: Int { return 0 }<br>      override var endIndex: Int { return _count }<br>      override subscript(index: Int) -&gt; Double { return _elements[index] }<br>      override func index(after i: Int) -&gt; Int { return i + 1 }<br>    }<br>    extension Vector {<br>      var count: Int { return _count }<br>      // error: property &#39;count&#39; was introduced by explicit conformance to Collection.<br>      // (Fixit: Add explicit override to the conformance block.)<br>    }<br></p><p>4a. When using a `conformance` block for retroactive modelling, or to explicitly include methods, properties etc. defined elsewhere, it is enough to list those in the body of the `conformance` block:<br></p><p>    protocol CountHaving {<br>      associatedtype Count : Integer<br>      var count: Count<br>    }<br>    conformance Array : HasCount {<br>      override var count: Int // Ok, explicit retroactive modelling.<br>    }<br></p><p>4b. Any override declarations without a body within an explicit `conformance` block are requirements for the definitions to exist elsewhere. That includes overridden properties without getters and setters. For example, here&#39;s an alternative way of fixing the error in #4:<br></p><p>    conformance Vector : Collection {<br>      override var startIndex: Int { return 0 }<br>      override var endIndex: Int { return _count }<br>      override subscript(index: Int) -&gt; Double { return _elements[index] }<br>      override func index(after i: Int) -&gt; Int { return i + 1 }<br>      override var count: Int // No body; defined elsewhere.<br>    }<br>    extension Vector {<br>      var count: Int { return _count } // Ok.<br>    }<br></p><p>5. Just like any other extensions, `conformance` blocks could introduce other non-`override` methods etc. to its needs, but they probably should keep it at minimum.<br></p><p>— — —<br></p><p>Downsides. Now, there are obvious reasons not to introduce this complexity to the language:<br></p><p>− It adds quite a bit of boilerplate to the conformance definition. (OTOH, programmers in a hurry would still be able to use the existing implicit conformance syntax, thereby avoiding the boilerplate on the one hand, and the better diagnostics on the other.)<br></p><p>− It would make it harder to add new required methods with default implementations without breaking code elsewhere.

(OTOH, maybe that&#39;s what they indeed asked for by making the conformance explicit!)<br></p><p>− It would add yet another keyword to the language, context-specific but regardless. And the amount of `override` noise isn&#39;t looking very pretty.<br></p><p>− It possibly complicates some other convenient use of protocols that I can&#39;t think of right now. Discuss.<br></p><p>On the plus sides,<br></p><p>+ There are precedents of explicit conformances in other languages: Haskell&#39;s type classes &lt;https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Classes_and_types#Classes_and_instances&gt; and Clojure&#39;s protocols &lt;http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/extend&gt; come to mind as most similar.<br></p><p>+ It better documents how exactly the type conforms to the protocol, without leaving any missing &quot;magic&quot; elsewhere in the codebase.

Allow marking the conformance to a given protocol with a block of code.<br>&gt; This could be nested inside a struct/enum/class body or its extension:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     *struct* Vector {<br>&gt;       *conformance* Hashable { /* TBD, read on… */ }<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;     *extension* Vector {<br>&gt;       *conformance* CustomStringConvertible { /* … */ }<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br></p><p>In general, I think there is an opposition to organizing nested blocks of<br>members like this (there was strong opposition to proposals for access<br>level grouping, for instance).

But, you are introducing a second keyword,<br>`conformance` without justification. The same purpose that you outline<br>later could be served by the existing spelling `extension Vector :<br>CustomDebugStringConvertible`, and this has been proposed earlier in this<br>thread and also in previous threads.<br></p><p><br>&gt; 2. Inside the body of that block, all protocol (non-extension) methods<br>&gt; *must* be marked with `override`. That includes both the required<br>&gt; interface and the customisable interface with library-provided default<br>&gt; implementations:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     *struct* Vector {<br>&gt;       *conformance* Hashable {<br>&gt;         *override static func* ==(lhs: *Self*, rhs: *Self*) -&gt; Bool { /*<br>&gt; … */ }<br>&gt;         // Ok.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         *var* hashValue: Int { /* … */ }<br>&gt;         // *error:* property &#39;hashValue&#39; is required by Hashable.<br>&gt;         // (Fixit: mark with &#39;override&#39;)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         *override static func* &lt; (lhs: *Self*, rhs: *Self*) -&gt; Bool { /*<br>&gt; … */ }<br>&gt;         // *error:* protocol Hashable does not require &#39;static func &lt;&#39;.<br>&gt;         // (Fixit #1: remove override. Etc.)<br>&gt;       }<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br></p><p>This is similar to a previous proposal that any member declared in<br>extensions that add a conformance must, if that member has the same or<br>greater visibility than the lesser of the type and protocol, implement a<br>protocol requirement. However, in your proposal, there&#39;s a pervasive<br>requirement for `override`, which adds noise but doesn&#39;t provide an<br>advantage over that alternative proposal. Moreover, I have a problem with<br>your proposed spelling: if there is no default implementation, why should<br>an implementation be said to `override` anything?<br></p><p><br>&gt; 3. When conformance is made explicit as described above, no other part of<br>&gt; code is allowed to interfere with that type&#39;s conformance to the protocol<br>&gt; under question:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     *conformance* Vector : Collection {<br>&gt;       *override var *startIndex: Int { *return* 0 }<br>&gt;       *override **var* endIndex: Int { *return* _count }<br>&gt;       *override **subscript*(index: Int) -&gt; Double { *return*<br>&gt; _elements[index] }<br>&gt;       *override **func* index(after i: Int) -&gt; Int { *return* i + 1 }<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;     *extension* Vector {<br>&gt;       *var* count: Int { *return* _count }<br>&gt;       // *error:* property &#39;count&#39; was introduced by explicit conformance to<br>&gt; Collection.<br>&gt;       // (Fixit: Add explicit override to the conformance block.)<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br></p><p>I&#39;m not sure what safety is gained by this particular rule. The language<br>should make the most simple cases the most straightforward. In the scenario<br>where a struct S, with only a small number of methods, conforms to protocol<br>P, which has only a small number of requirements and no default<br>implementations, it is not confusing at all to put all requirements in the<br>same block of code. Your proposed syntax, if made mandatory [see below<br>about mandatory vs. optional], would greatly increase the visual clutter<br>and difficulty of correctly conforming one simple struct to one simple<br>protocol.<br></p><p>4a. When using a `conformance` block for retroactive modelling, or to<br>&gt; explicitly include methods, properties etc. defined elsewhere, it is enough<br>&gt; to list those in the body of the `conformance` block:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     *protocol* CountHaving {<br>&gt;       *associatedtype* Count : Integer<br>&gt;       *var* count: Count<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;     *conformance* Array : HasCount {<br>&gt;       *override var* count: Int // Ok, explicit retroactive modelling.<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br></p><p>This might be unworkable for certain types of retroactive modeling. If I<br>add a new default implementation to a requirement of `Collection`, I would<br>have to write out conformance statements for *every single Collection type*<br>in the standard library, probably Foundation and Dispatch also, plus any<br>other libraries I use, in addition to my own Collection types. The only way<br>to solve this issue, as far as I can tell, is to say that none of these<br>keywords are required across module boundaries, which carves out an<br>exception (which might be justifiable, but it&#39;s still an exception to the<br>rule).<br></p><p><br>&gt; 4b. Any override declarations without a body within an explicit<br>&gt; `conformance` block are requirements for the definitions to exist<br>&gt; elsewhere. That includes overridden properties without getters and setters.<br>&gt; For example, here&#39;s an alternative way of fixing the error in #4:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     *conformance* Vector : Collection {<br>&gt;       *override var *startIndex: Int { *return* 0 }<br>&gt;       *override **var* endIndex: Int { *return* _count }<br>&gt;       *override **subscript*(index: Int) -&gt; Double { *return* _elements[index]<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;       *override **func* index(after i: Int) -&gt; Int { *return* i + 1 }<br>&gt;       *override var* count: Int // No body; defined elsewhere.<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;     *extension* Vector {<br>&gt;       *var* count: Int { *return* _count } // Ok.<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br></p><p>This is clever, but also confusing (IMO) because you&#39;ve now introduced more<br>than one way of splitting up code that fulfills protocol requirements, when<br>your stated goal is to improve the situation by putting all requirements in<br>the same place.<br></p><p>Although you&#39;ve insisted on a central location where there&#39;s a catalog of<br>overrides, it might increase rather than decrease confusion about where<br>these requirements are being implemented, because now there&#39;s at least two<br>declarations. For derived classes that conform to protocols but inherit<br>their implementation from a base class, there are additional difficulties:<br>Does `override` mean you&#39;re overriding the base class implementation, or<br>are you using `override` to say that the base class implementation (which<br>you&#39;re not overriding in the derived class) should override the protocol&#39;s<br>default implementation? Also, even though I see a declaration of a protocol<br>requirement with no body, I might not find the implementation anywhere in<br>the derived class, because it&#39;s in another file, and I may not even have<br>access to that source code. In general, it&#39;s exceedingly weird that the<br>derived class would have to re-declare an inherited method with the word<br>`override`, then never override or mention that method again.<br></p><p>5. Just like any other extensions, `conformance` blocks could introduce<br>&gt; other non-`override` methods etc. to its needs, but they probably should<br>&gt; keep it at minimum.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>As mentioned earlier, I think a more preferable and terse rule was proposed<br>earlier, where extensions that add conformance are not allowed to have<br>public members (or members equal or more visible than the protocol or type)<br>that don&#39;t implement a requirement.<br></p><p>— — —<br>&gt;<br>&gt; *Downsides. *Now, there are obvious reasons not to introduce this<br>&gt; complexity to the language:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; − It adds quite a bit of boilerplate to the conformance definition.

It&#39;s<br>not great, but it might not in and of itself be a deal-breaker.<br></p><p>However, the key weakness here IMO is that you are trying to address the<br>weaknesses above by saying that this whole new syntax is _optional_. This<br>is, IMO, a critical flaw. I could _maybe_ get behind a single opt-in<br>keyword or attribute; but I think a whole new alternative syntax for<br>something as fundamental as conformance is a non-starter. This is a very,<br>very essential part of Swift; there should be *one* syntax for protocol<br>conformance, not two. We should find the one best syntax, though obviously<br>we are now constrained by backwards compatibility issues.<br></p><p><br>&gt; − It would make it harder to add new required methods with default<br>&gt; implementations without breaking code elsewhere. Because explicitly<br>&gt; conforming types which already happened to have a matching function,<br>&gt; property, or subscript would need to include it in the explicit conformance<br>&gt; block.

And the amount of `override` noise isn&#39;t looking very pretty.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>Yes, these two weaknesses are definitely issues. In general, from the<br>perspective of library evolution, there&#39;s a key question to be answered: if<br>the library vendor adds a new default implementation to a protocol, should<br>they need to be concerned that it could cause existing code using a<br>previous version of the library to stop compiling?<br></p><p>Currently, the answer is no, and I think it is the right answer most (if<br>not all) of the the time. I have this opinion because types that conform to<br>the protocol using a previous version of the library cannot possibly change<br>their behavior if a new default implementation is supplied, since these<br>types necessarily have their own implementation of the same requirement and<br>since protocol requirements are dynamically dispatched and there&#39;s no way<br>to break that encapsulation. Therefore, it is unnecessarily disruptive to<br>stop compiling that code in order to force the end user to acknowledge a<br>change that cannot have any effect on their own code. I conclude that any<br>keyword should be _optional_ (if you _want_ your code to break<br>unnecessarily, I guess that can be up to you...), but then see above about<br>my reasoning regarding an optional syntax for protocol conformance.<br></p><p>− It possibly complicates some other convenient use of protocols that I<br>&gt; can&#39;t think of right now.

Why should I as an author care whether a method contributes to a protocol conformance or not if the compiler can tell me that kind of information itself?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Being able to reason about your code, what it does, and what it’s for is undesirable?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That&#39;s not an answer to the question I asked.  Why is this significant enough to warrant an entire keyword?  The clutter of a whole keyword that does nothing but wait for a developer to make a source-compatible binary-breaking change to an interface does not seem worth it.  Maybe you can convince me otherwise. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Same reason overriding a class method warrants a keyword. It expresses the purpose more clearly, and allows the compiler to catch mistakes for us.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; That&#39;s just it: The class of mistakes one can make by not being explicit about overrides is significantly more dangerous than the class of mistakes caused by dead code leftover from trimming protocols.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I am in the middle of a large refactor of code that was originally Objective-C and then Swift written like Objective-C, to more idiomatic protocol-oriented Swift. I am finding that in Swift’s POP idiom, protocols with overrides are serving very nearly the same purpose that overrides were serving in the old design; hence, I don’t really think either is more or less dangerous than the other.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; protocol MyProtocol {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func myMethod() -&gt; String<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyClass: MyProtocol {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     conform func myMethod() -&gt; String {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         return &quot;Yuhuuu,I am conforming \\o// &lt;smb://o//&gt;&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func whatever() {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         print(&quot;I am a boring method and I don&#39;t conform anything&quot;)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It would be something similar to the current keyword `override` but for protocols. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Apart from improving code readability, It would allow the detection, in compilation time, of errors due to code evolution. For example redundant methods that no longer conform anything once the requirement is removed from the protocol for whatever reason.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you make a breaking change to a protocol like this, you should have gone through a deprecation cycle to indicate to your clients the appropriate changes you&#39;re going to make to the protocol.  This aspect of the change seems to if not encourage, highlight, bad behavior.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What if it’s your own code and all the callers are internal? What if you’re still developing the protocol and haven’t released the API interface yet?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then your concerns are local enough that you know where all implementations of the protocol lie and whether they require deletion or not.  The point about deprecation cycles still stands in all the cases you mention.  Just because the interface is private doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t take responsibility for keeping it as clean as you can.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Charles<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tl;dr It seems like all of this can be subsumed by us warning about dead code.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did you look at my examples earlier in the thread? Neither of those would be caught by warning about dead code.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The example involving the default implementation is most compelling, but it indicates that your proposed solution should focus on the protocol extension and not the implementing declaration.  Perhaps reusing one of our existing keywords can help here<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; extension P {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   default func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; struct S: P {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, this change would be potentially source-breaking either way - I don&#39;t like the sound of an &quot;optional keyword”.  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I can come up with a similar example without the mistake being in the extension, though:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt;&gt; 	func foo() {}<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; extension P {<br>&gt;&gt; 	func foo() { print(“Default Behavior”) }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; struct S: P {<br>&gt;&gt; 	func foo() { print(“Specific Behavior”) }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; So far, so good. But now I realize that the original protocol needs an argument:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; protocol P {<br>&gt;&gt; 	func foo(bar: String) {}<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; extension P {<br>&gt;&gt; 	func foo(bar: String) { print(“Default Behavior; bar is \(bar)”) }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; struct S: P {<br>&gt;&gt; 	func foo() { print(“Specific Behavior”) } // Whoops, forgot to update this method, and now it won’t get called—and we of course won’t see the carnage until runtime.<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Either way, we can all agree we need better diagnostics around these cases.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; No doubt.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Charles<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160825/eb8c969a/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
