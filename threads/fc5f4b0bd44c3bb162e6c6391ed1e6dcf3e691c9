July 10, 2016. The proposal has been *accepted*:<br></p><p>The community and core team agree that this proposal clarifies the rules around the unsafe pointer APIs, while making them “work by default” and balance safety and unsafety in an understandable way.  Andy has revised the proposal several times due to community feedback (which is why we extended the review period), which makes my job easier because the core team agrees to accept it nearly as-is :-).  The only request from the core team is to remove the default value from the ‘alignedTo:’ parameters of the allocate and deallocate methods, forcing their callers to be explicit about the alignment required by an allocation.<br></p><p>Thank you to Andrew Trick for driving this discussion as well as the implementation forward!<br></p><p>-Chris Lattner<br>Review Manager<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
