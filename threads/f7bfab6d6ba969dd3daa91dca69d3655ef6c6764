The proposal is available here:<br></p><p>https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0109-remove-boolean.md<br>Reviews are an important part of the Swift evolution process. All reviews should be sent to the swift-evolution mailing list at<br></p><p>https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>or, if you would like to keep your feedback private, directly to the review manager.

When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br></p><p>What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>How much effort did you put into your review?

This turns out to be a feature that is convenient most of the time but subtly problematic in ways that are confusing and troublesome.  I was hopeful that Swift&#39;s more structured approach using a protocol might work out better but it didn&#39;t.<br></p><p>&gt; How much effort did you put into your review?
