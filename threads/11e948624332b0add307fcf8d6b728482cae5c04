We think it&#39;s a reasonable tradeoff for objects which do require fixed scopes to require a bit of additional annotation.<br></p><p>-Joe<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151230/24d09a36/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6451ee8093c9cedc94f6c813b4dde2c5?s=50"></div><header><strong>Keeping unused values around until containing scope exits?</strong> from <string>Kevin Ballard</string> &lt;kevin at sb.org&gt;<p>December 30, 2015 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>I strongly recommend either making the context get explicitly used in the subsequent animations (e.g. `context.animation(...)` instead of just `animation(...)`) or giving it an explicit scope (e.g. `withAnimationContext(speed: 1.0, bounciness: 1.0) { ... }`).
