In my opinion this has been a serious deficit of the language so far, many other languages include cryptographic APIs  as part of their runtime. Developers need libraries they can trust when it comes to crypto, and using some third party library found on Github I don’t think is a good solution. Bridging in the C based CommonCrypto is a workaround but adds complexity especially when you’re trying to build a framework to be used by others.<br></p><p>Travis Beech | Principal Developer | Unwired Revolution<br>Optimizing Operations for Mobile and Distributed Systems<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151209/b61ccd63/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>Swift Core Crypto</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>December  9, 2015 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; I know this is not in scope for Swift 3.0 but has there been any talk about including cryptographic APIs into the core language runtime?<br></p><p>Not yet.
