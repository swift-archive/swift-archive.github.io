Taking<br>both statements together this proposal seems to be aimed at a sub-set of<br>a sub-set of developers. That alone would tell me this is a problem that<br>is not significant enough to warrant a change to Swift.<br></p><p>Unfortunately the statistics provided in the proposal heavily weigh<br>open-source Swift code and discount code written in closed-source<br>applications. My intuition, based on the volume of feedback provided on<br>the swift-evolution mailing list, tells me there is likely to be some<br>practical Swift code written in closed-source and enterprise<br>applications that is not being equally counted by the proposal<br>statistics. While the intent of the argument, that the syntax is not<br>widely used, is warranted I question these statistics and methods.<br></p><p>Additionally in the “confusion of use” example the `while` loop would<br>seem to be a moot point. It is my understanding that SE-0099 has already<br>removed the inconsistent `while` condition. Assuming that is true, it is<br>hard to believe that future new developers are going to be confused by a<br>syntax that they are unable to experience or use. If this assumption is<br>incorrect than I&#39;d argue the correct course of action is to remove the<br>`while` loop behavior rather than for-in behavior.<br></p><p>Moving to more concrete code based examples. The introduction<br>effectively states that the proposal means to enforce a coding style or<br>convention by removal of another. This seems like something that should<br>be enforced by a linting tool, not the Swift compiler. To put a point on<br>this, I looked at one snippet of code cited in the “Frequency of Use”<br>section as a concrete example of what code would look like before and<br>after accepting the proposal [1].<br></p><p>Before:<br></p><p>/// Returns the greatest argument passed.<br>///<br>/// If there are multiple equal greatest arguments, returns the last<br>one.<br>public func max&lt;T : Comparable&gt;(_ x: T, _ y: T, _ z: T, _ rest: T...) -&gt;<br>T {<br>  var maxValue = max(max(x, y), z)<br>  // In case `value == maxValue`, we pick `value`. See min(_:_:).<br>  for value in rest where value &gt;= maxValue {<br>    maxValue = value<br>  }<br>  return maxValue<br>}<br></p><p>After:<br></p><p>/// Returns the greatest argument passed.<br>///<br>/// If there are multiple equal greatest arguments, returns the last<br>one.<br>public func max&lt;T : Comparable&gt;(_ x: T, _ y: T, _ z: T, _ rest: T...) -&gt;<br>T {<br>  var maxValue = max(max(x, y), z)<br>  // In case `value == maxValue`, we pick `value`. See min(_:_:).<br>  for value in rest {<br>    guard value &gt;= maxValue else { continue }<br>    maxValue = value<br>  }<br>  return maxValue<br>}<br></p><p>It is not obvious to me how removing the `where` and adding the `guard`<br>“reduce[d] cognitive burden when interpreting intent”. Frankly in my<br>estimation it increased it. Now the for-in loop declaration has to be<br>read along with the trailing `guard` to interpret the intent of the<br>loop. I concede it is possible I just do not understand what is meant by<br>cognitive burden when interpreting intent. But I cannot shake the<br>feeling the argument is specious.<br></p><p>At this point I would like to draw attention to the fact that both the<br>“Before” and “After” syntax are fully supported in Swift right now. If<br>one is preferred by a developer as clearer both options are available.<br>And as I pointed out earlier could be enforced by a linting tool.<br></p><p>The motivation provided for the removal of the feature would seem to be<br>applicable to any number of existing Swift features. Not least of which<br>is the pattern matching for-in loop.<br></p><p>enum Thing { case One; case Two; case Three; case Four }<br>let foo: [Thing] = [.One, .Two, .One, .Three, .Four, .One]<br>for case .One in foo { print(&quot;Found a .One&quot;) }<br></p><p>I feel confident that most (all?) of the motivations applied by this<br>proposal would be equally applicable to the example pattern matching<br>for-in loop above. Especially the strongest of those arguments,<br>specifically that it elevates one style, the  `continue` on condition,<br>above other related styles.<br></p><p>[1]<br>https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/a51aa91032ff7ba13bdc883122f4e8868aee6413/stdlib/public/core/Algorithm.swift#L47-54<br></p><p>&gt; Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>No. In fact, I think that even the proposal itself says as much. The<br>proposal indicates it means to deprecate an available coding style. It<br>seems to me, as much as is practicable, style changes should be enforced<br>by something other than the Swift compiler.<br></p><p>The proposed `guard` syntax is complete today and is available as a<br>“work-around” for any of the conditions not elevated by this existing<br>Swift syntactic sugar feature.<br></p><p>Of course, other alternatives could be considered, such as expanding<br>this behavior to include `while`, `unless` and `until`. Though that<br>change seems pre-mature. A more pragmatic approach, since the change<br>would be additive, would be to defer until after Swift 3.<br></p><p>&gt; Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>No. Swift.org [1] lists as one of the “additional” features of the<br>language “Fast and concise iteration over a range or collection”.<br>Removing this feature does little to positively augment that feature.<br></p><p>Swift is opinionated. This is a good thing. It should have strong<br>opinions about safe, fast and expressive code. I do not believe the<br>existing for-in where clause syntax violates any of those features.<br>Furthermore it does nothing to increase the joy of writing Swift code<br>(an explicitly stated goal of Swift [1]).<br></p><p>[1] https://swift.org/about/<br></p><p>&gt; If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>I’ve never experienced this syntax in other languages. Though, coming<br>from C, it is a welcome improvement over that language’s syntax and<br>provides a lot of practical value. <br></p><p>&gt; How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>A fairly in-depth study. I looked at code that I have access to inside<br>of my work environment (as well as refactoring some for-in loops). I<br>also actively participated in the discussion on the swift-evolution<br>mailing lists. <br></p><p>Additionally, I discussed with co-workers and spouse. These discussions<br>were especially illuminating to me. Because many of my co-workers, as<br>well as my spouse, while being professional software developers, have<br>never worked with Swift. Not a single person I was able to discuss the<br>topic with was confused by the existing syntax regardless of their<br>experience level with Swift. Most shared confusion as to why the<br>proposed `guard` syntax was considered better at all. Most found `guard`<br>in and of itself to be more confusing than `where` combined with for-in.<br>Though it does strongly color my opinion of these changes it is, of<br>course, purely anecdotal.<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5451f7df31d36d0159a018706aec7adb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0105: Removing Where Clauses from For-In Loops</strong> from <string>Erica Sadun</string> &lt;erica at ericasadun.com&gt;<p>June 23, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jun 23, 2016, at 7:42 AM, Ryan Lovelett via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; No. In fact, I think that even the proposal itself says as much.

The &quot;where&quot; notation is perfectly grounded<br>in mathematics and set theory and its meaning is clear.  &quot;for x in y where<br>z&quot; reads almost exactly like the set notation &quot;{x ∈ y | z}&quot; does aloud.<br></p><p>The fact that some users may be confused by this terminology is not a<br>reason to remove it from the language. Some users will be confused by many<br>concepts in programming languages. If that means this is considered an<br>&quot;advanced&quot; feature, so be it. We should be able to have a language that has<br>both basic features and advanced features, and when a new developer comes<br>across a feature they don&#39;t understand, they learn it, and then they know<br>it. This is not an insurmountable problem.<br></p><p>IIRC, this proposal was a follow-up to the removal of &quot;where&quot; in &quot;if&quot;<br>statements, but the two uses of the term are unrelated. In &quot;if&quot; statements,<br>&quot;where&quot; was used to separate let-bindings from other parts of the<br>conditional—it was not a filter over a collection and did not correspond to<br>existing mathematical terms of art. That&#39;s not the case here, and it feels<br>like surface-level consistency for consistency&#39;s sake.<br></p><p><br></p><p>&gt;         * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt;<br></p><p>No. The alternatives are worse, IMO:<br></p><p>* Putting if/guard and continue at the front of the loop is more clutter<br>and expresses the concept in terms of control flow instead of sequence<br>filtration, when the latter is closer to expressing the semantics of what<br>the loop is doing. I would argue that it increases the mental load because<br>now I have to parse an &quot;if&quot; or a &quot;guard&quot;, the condition, and the &quot;continue&quot;<br>to make sure that it&#39;s doing exactly what it&#39;s doing (and the fact that<br>&quot;guard&quot; could be used here means there is implicit negation that I have to<br>parse on top of that), whereas &quot;where foo&quot; is right there and immediately<br>unambiguous.<br></p><p>* Using .filter() many times requires that .lazy also be used in order to<br>be performant. In many cases, writing the naïve .filter() line will return<br>a new copied collection and users are likely to accidentally write code<br>that is slower than it should be.<br></p><p>The fact that it only elevates one particular control flow construct (&quot;if x<br>else continue&quot;) doesn&#39;t seem relevant. It&#39;s a common case and the language<br>should simplify common cases when possible. As a matter of fact, I would<br>also be supportive of the &quot;for x in y while z&quot; that some other people have<br>offered for the same reason. While it&#39;s less based on set theory than<br>&quot;where&quot;, it optimizes another common case.<br></p><p><br></p><p>&gt;         * If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar<br>&gt; feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>        * How much effort did you put into your review?

In my experience, that is very much NOT the case. In fact I would argue that the syntax of “where” and the way it is structured encourages brevity and clarification of intent in ways that a list of guards and ifs cannot because a bunch of guard/if statements has no syntactic pressure limiting their proliferation in the loop’s body whereas the “where” construct does.<br></p><p>Usage metrics are not a strong argument to me. I know that argument was also partially used to support removal of C-style for-loops (a decision with which I strongly support), but in that case I feel there were many other good supporting arguments in play. In the case of removing “where”, it seems the primary argument is usage stats pulled from a few open source projects (some of which may even have code predating the introduction of “where” on for loops) and some anecdotal suggestions that it might be confusing the very first time someone encounters it without having read the documentation beforehand. The latter argument is very weak, IMO, because as far as I can tell, there is zero evidence (not even anecdotal) that once a person learns how “for-where” works that there is ever confusion about it again or that it is ever a source of bugs as a result of confusion.<br></p><p>If this proposal was for replacing for-where with a full fledged Python-ish list comprehension kind of construct, then I might have a different opinion. As it is, it’s in favor of removing the closest thing we have to them and replacing it with nothing.<br></p><p>I could imagine supporting an *adjustment* to for-where’s syntax to this, for example:<br></p><p>for x where x &lt; 42 in sequence {<br>}<br></p><p>However it seemed the discussion was centered almost exclusively around the idea of just getting rid of it rather than trying to fix any of the perceived flaws it may have.<br></p><p><br>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>I don’t even agree there’s a problem to solve here.<br></p><p><br>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>No.<br></p><p><br>&gt; 	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>I’ve used many languages without for-where. After using Swift and for-where, I no longer like those languages as much.<br></p><p><br>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review?

I do not believe that it has ever been a Swift goal that “there is only way one way to do it.”<br></p><p>Please consider the following example code:<br></p><p>  for line in lines where !line.isEmpty() {<br>    …<br>  }<br></p><p>The intent of this code is clear to the reader. A set of lines from a line is being iterated, and filtered such that the code within the loop is only operating on those that are not empty. This is a fairly common pattern when working with files, for example. It may be that the code within the loop would work perfectly well even in the case of empty lines, the programmer simply does not wish to consider them.<br></p><p>Filtered iteration is a common pattern throughout programming, other uses include things like iterating the set of “updated objects” in Core Data, etc.<br></p><p>Now consider the equivalent avoiding a `where` clause, and replacing it with `guard`:<br></p><p>  for line in lines {<br>    guard !line.isEmpty() else { continue }<br>    …<br>  }<br></p><p>To the compiler it is the same code, but to the programmer this may have a very different intent.<br></p><p>`guard` in Swift is _not_ simply a generic `unless` statement, the name was chosen very specifically and less harsh names rejected. `guard` belongs closer to the family of `assert` and `precondition` than it does to `if`. `guard` is used to provide an expression of pattern that *must* be true for the code following it to operate without error or other unintended side-effects. This is why the `else` block must, in some way, exit the containing scope of the `guard`.<br></p><p>In first example the code makes it clear, to me, that it is normal for the set of lines to contain non-empty, and empty lines. But in the second example, to me, the code makes it clear that non-empty lines are not expected in the set, and would cause the code to error if they were present; the code guards against this by stepping over them—following Postel’s Law.<br></p><p>My opinion would be that the correct way of preserving the intent of the first example would be either:<br></p><p>  for line in lines {<br>    if !line.isEmpty() {<br>      …<br>    }<br>  }<br></p><p>or:<br></p><p>  for line in lines.lazy.filter({ !$0.isEmpty() }) {<br>    …<br>  }<br></p><p>The second case is particularly troubling here because it’s “hard to get right” from a performance point of view. The clarity of `for`/`where` wins over all of these.<br></p><p>Scott<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c72bd3ba434ad651a5d8d3d79f2d4c49?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0105: Removing Where Clauses from For-In Loops</strong> from <string>Scott James Remnant</string> &lt;scott at netsplit.com&gt;<p>June 23, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>A separate point I would make, aside from my previous long-winded comment about clarity, is that the “confusion of use” in this proposal has already been corrected by SE-0099 which has removed `where` clauses from optional-binding and case-conditions.<br></p><p>Scott<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d4fb9162c777a5d6d0b1fb00893d709?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0105: Removing Where Clauses from For-In Loops</strong> from <string>Haravikk</string> &lt;swift-evolution at haravikk.me&gt;<p>June 23, 2016 at 11:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On 23 Jun 2016, at 05:12, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>I&#39;m against it.

Also note that even if you *did* go for 2-of-each, picking names that are sufficiently self-evident is harder than it looks, so in practice you’d almost certainly still have to wind up learning at least one of them, if not both.<br></p><p>Additionally, I would point `for-in-where` has some unique aspects that would complicate taking the “remove today to improve tomorrow” approach (as has been done with some other features like splatting).<br></p><p>Specifically, using for-in-where is a stylistic decision, and although translating its uses *to* `guard-continue` form can be done mechanically, translating `guard-continue` *back* to the (successor of) `for-in-where` in a stylistically-appropriate way seems much harder to mechanize…so if it was dropped for later, improved reinstatement, the temporary dropping might result in losing a lot of the original human stylistic choice, which IMHO is useful evidence of the original human intent.<br></p><p>&gt; On Jun 22, 2016, at 11:12 PM, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The review of &quot;SE-0105: Removing Where Clauses from For-In Loops&quot; begins now and runs through June 29.

A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md (https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.mdThank)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Thank (https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.mdThank)  you,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -Chris Lattner<br>&gt; Review Manager<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing  list (mailto:listswift-evolution at swift.orghttps)<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org (mailto:listswift-evolution at swift.orghttps)<br>&gt; https (mailto:listswift-evolution at swift.orghttps)://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;          <br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160624/be152fdb/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5451f7df31d36d0159a018706aec7adb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0105: Removing Where Clauses from For-In Loops</strong> from <string>Erica Sadun</string> &lt;erica at ericasadun.com&gt;<p>June 24, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jun 24, 2016, at 11:26 AM, Karl Wagner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -1<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;ve followed this discussion since the beginning, and I feel the usage is clear given that for...in is a *data-driven* loop<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I wouldn&#39;t mind renaming to &quot;if&quot; if there is some confusion, but I think we use &quot;where&quot; consistently in the language (and Dave Abrahams proposal for closure argument names takes this further), so could be argued that it&#39;s already clear.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Perhaps we should use &quot;where&quot; consistently for data-filtering operations, and possibly rename the generic constraint specifier.

Moreover, it&#39;s arbitrary and inconsistent in a way that inflates the apparent magnitude of the problem.<br></p><p>Firstly: There is no need whatsoever for both &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; versions of each condition. Swift doesn&#39;t have `if` and `unless`, or `guard` and `prevent`, or `while` and `until`. It expects you to use the not operator or reverse the sense of your comparisons (`!=` instead of `==`, `&gt;=` instead of `&lt;`, etc.). We can do the same thing here. If `if !` is good enough, then so is `where !`.<br></p><p>Secondly: Yes, `where` and `while` are both available as list operations (`filter` and `prefix(while:)`), but so are `map` and `sorted`, and nobody is suggesting we need those as keywords. (Well, some people have suggested some additional `for` keywords, but they&#39;re wrong.) If we feel that `where` is special, there&#39;s nothing wrong with offering only `where`.<br></p><p>And I *would* argue that `where` is special. It&#39;s special because skipping an element feels less like control flow than terminating a loop. It&#39;s special because `where` is not order-dependent, but `while` is. It&#39;s special because terminating the loop is a more drastic action. It&#39;s special because the `continue` keyword is less clear than the `break` keyword, but is considered an inviolable term of art. It&#39;s special because I suspect (but admittedly cannot prove) that `continue` is more frequently used at the top of a loop, controlled by a single conditional statement based on a side-effect-free boolean operation, than `break`.<br></p><p>Think of it this way: We have not accepted the often-proposed `else`-less `guard`, but if we did, there is broad agreement that, absent an &quot;always `return`&quot; rule for simplicity, the most obvious body to infer inside a loop is `continue`. There are reasons for that, and they&#39;re the exact same reasons we support `where` but not `while`.<br></p><p>* * *<br></p><p>My review of this proposal follows.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>I think the motivation is weak and do not find it compelling.<br></p><p>The &quot;elevates one style above other related styles&quot; motivation fails to convince me for the reasons described above; &quot;difficult to document separately at its point of use&quot; can be addressed simply by adding a newline before the `where` clause; &quot;hard to breakpoint and debug&quot; is true of any expression, and is easily addressed by extracting that expression into an inner function; and &quot;rarely used&quot; is, in my opinion, more a result of how it is taught and documented than of how useful it is.<br></p><p>In my opinion, the *only* valid argument cited for the removal of `where` is that learners sometimes misunderstand it. I&#39;m very sympathetic to learners, and I would like to improve their experience with this feature. But there are many other ways to help them, like:<br></p><p>* Making sure that &quot;The Swift Programming Language&quot; teaches the use of `for`/`where`.<br></p><p>* Adding help content for language keywords to Xcode and Swift Playgrounds.<br></p><p>* Making syntax adjustments that might improve clarity, like my suggestion that putting the `where` clause next to the variable might clarify that you are filtering the values which will be seen inside the loop.<br></p><p>* Changing the keyword, if a better keyword can be found.<br></p><p>But at this point, measures like these have not been tried, and I have not heard convincing arguments that they will not work.<br></p><p>Meanwhile, the proposal does not address the problems it causes, suggest that they *should* be addressed in a future proposal, or even acknowledge that there *are* any problems. If `where` is removed, none of its alternatives are nearly as good:<br></p><p>* `guard`/`else`/`continue` clutters the logic with completely avoidable boilerplate.<br></p><p>More worryingly, it obscures the intent: &quot;Skip elements like this&quot; becomes &quot;Elements must be like this, and if they&#39;re not, go to the next element&quot;. Converting a meaning into mechanical instructions to achieve it is not an improvement. If we wanted to do that, we could dispose of `for`/`in` entirely and replace it with:<br></p><p>	var iterator = collection.makeIterator()<br>	while let elem = iterator.next() { … }<br></p><p>Folks who wrote AppKit code on Tiger would feel right at home.<br></p><p>* `filter(suchThat:)` (or whatever we call it) is dramatically less efficient and has syntactic issues with that particular slot because trailing closures are unavailable.<br></p><p>* `lazy.filter(suchThat:)` lies on a narrow golden path (it&#39;s all too easy to forget the `lazy`) and still has the same syntactic issues as a plain `filter`.<br></p><p>We retired `where` clauses from `if` statements because they were a grammatical hack, an unnatural usage forced on us by the desire to support a feature (multiple optional bindings or pattern matches per keyword) that, in hindsight, we realized was less important. There is no similar consideration driving this proposal. Instead, the justification offered is essentially a series of style complaints and an argument that, if you don&#39;t try to teach the feature and you don&#39;t try to improve it, some people sometimes guess its meaning incorrectly. That&#39;s just not enough.<br></p><p>For the reasons above, I urge the core team to reject this proposal.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Quite possibly. But removing `for`/`in`/`where` is an overreaction. When your arm is broken, you put a cast on it; you don&#39;t cut it off.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes in that it&#39;s a clean-up attempt, but no in that it forces additional boilerplate.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>`for`/`in`/`where` is necessitated by circumstances that are somewhat unique to Swift among the languages I&#39;ve used, so I don&#39;t really have a basis for comparison.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>Participated pretty heavily in previous discussions.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
