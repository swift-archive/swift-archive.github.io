I still believe that sending () to function declared as &#39;func foo()&#39; <br>should be discussed separately from both(SE-0066,SE-0110), as was not <br>mentioned explicitly in proposals and can have more impact on current <br>source code than expected in proposals. But it seems no body else care of <br>this, so OK, probably I&#39;m not right, I give up. Let&#39;s change this.<br></p><p>2. But *do* believe the SE-0066 proposal should be updated in &quot;Impact on <br>existing code&quot; part to show how code that relies on the feature of sending <br>Void aka () to empty-parameter list function should be changed and how &quot;The <br>migrator will automatically add parentheses to existing code when moving <br>from Swift 2 to Swift 3&quot; in this case. Because right now this section in <br>proposal is just not true.<br></p><p>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a0b362cd96d9f85beab1079ff37e3d19?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pre-proposal] Fix function type grammar</strong> from <string>Vladimir.S</string> &lt;svabox at gmail.com&gt;<p>July  3, 2016 at 10:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On 03.07.2016 19:04, Anton Zhilin via swift-evolution wrote:<br>&gt; Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at ...&gt; writes:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Hi Anton,<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; This looks correct, but what is the proposal “for”?

What does `-&gt; ()` now will mean? still <br>&quot;implicitly returns Void&quot; or &quot;returns nothing&quot;?
