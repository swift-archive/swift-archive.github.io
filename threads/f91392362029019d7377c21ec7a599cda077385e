To figure out what a piece of<br>code means, someone reading it will have to mentally keep track of a “type<br>stack” for every variable. That is the opposite of “clarity at the point of<br>use”.<br></p><p>For the motivating examples, there is already a much cleaner solution:<br></p><p>(foo as? B)?.someMethodSpecificToB()<br></p><p>Even in the case where foo gets passed as an argument to a function that<br>takes a B, so optional chaining is not available, we are still okay. If foo<br>is an instance of a struct, then passing it to a function won’t change its<br>value so we can write:<br></p><p>if let newFoo = foo as? B {<br>    funcThatTakesB(newFoo)<br>}<br></p><p>And if foo is an instance of a class, then the same thing *still* works,<br>because any changes the function makes to newFoo are also observed in foo<br>since they reference the same object.<br></p><p>• • •<br></p><p>The proposal’s other example is actually a great illustration of why<br>shadowing is undesirable. After all, simply binding to a different name<br>solves the so-called problem, *and* lets us bind to a constant:<br></p><p>var foo: A? = A()<br>if let newFoo = foo {<br>    newFoo.someMethod()<br>    foo!.someMutatingMethod()  // Works now!<br>}<br></p><p>Full disclosure: both this and the original example have a *deeper*<br>problem, which is that they are not thread-safe. If foo is modified between<br>the conditional binding and the force-unwrap, the force-unwrap could fail.<br>Sure, that can’t happen when foo is a local variable like this, but if it<br>were a property of a class then it could.<br></p><p>Moreover, the proposed “solution” has the same concurrency failure, but<br>hides it even worse because the force-unwrap operator doesn’t even appear<br>in the code:<br></p><p>var foo:A? = A()<br>if foo != nil {<br>   foo.someMethod()          // Bad news!<br>   foo.someMutatingMethod()  // Bad news!<br>}<br></p><p>In summary, I do not see sufficient motivation for this proposal. The<br>motivation which I do see appears superfluous. The problem being described<br>already has an elegant solution in Swift. And the proposed changes<br>introduce an exceptionally taxing cognitive burden on developers just to<br>figure out what the type of a variable is on any given line of code.<br></p><p>Plus, in the face of concurrency, such implicit type-narrowing has the<br>potential to hide serious issues.<br></p><p>Nevin<br></p><p><br>On Thu, Nov 3, 2016 at 1:04 PM, Haravikk via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; To avoid hijacking the guard let x = x thread entirely I&#39;ve decided to try<br>&gt; to write up a proposal on type narrowing in Swift.<br>&gt; Please give your feedback on the functionality proposed, as well as the<br>&gt; clarity of the proposal/examples themselves; I&#39;ve tried to keep it<br>&gt; straightforward, but I do tend towards being overly verbose, I&#39;ve always<br>&gt; tried to have the examples build upon one another to show how it all stacks<br>&gt; up.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Type Narrowing<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - Proposal: SE-NNNN<br>&gt;    &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/NNNN-type-narrowing.md&gt;<br>&gt;    - Author: Haravikk &lt;https://github.com/haravikk&gt;<br>&gt;    - Status: Awaiting review<br>&gt;    - Review manager: TBD<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals#introduction&gt;<br>&gt; Introduction<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This proposal is to introduce type-narrowing to Swift, enabling the<br>&gt; type-checker to automatically infer a narrower type from context such as<br>&gt; conditionals.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Swift-evolution thread: Discussion thread topic for that proposal<br>&gt; &lt;http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals#motivation&gt;<br>&gt; Motivation<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Currently in Swift there are various pieces of boilerplate required in<br>&gt; order to manually narrow types.

To figure out what a piece of<br>&gt; code means, someone reading it will have to mentally keep track of a “type<br>&gt; stack” for every variable. That is the opposite of “clarity at the point of<br>&gt; use”.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; For the motivating examples, there is already a much cleaner solution:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (foo as? B)?.someMethodSpecificToB()<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Even in the case where foo gets passed as an argument to a function that<br>&gt; takes a B, so optional chaining is not available, we are still okay. If foo<br>&gt; is an instance of a struct, then passing it to a function won’t change its<br>&gt; value so we can write:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; if let newFoo = foo as? B {<br>&gt;     funcThatTakesB(newFoo)<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And if foo is an instance of a class, then the same thing *still* works,<br>&gt; because any changes the function makes to newFoo are also observed in foo<br>&gt; since they reference the same object.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; • • •<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The proposal’s other example is actually a great illustration of why<br>&gt; shadowing is undesirable. After all, simply binding to a different name<br>&gt; solves the so-called problem, *and* lets us bind to a constant:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; var foo: A? = A()<br>&gt; if let newFoo = foo {<br>&gt;     newFoo.someMethod()<br>&gt;     foo!.someMutatingMethod()  // Works now!<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Full disclosure: both this and the original example have a *deeper*<br>&gt; problem, which is that they are not thread-safe. If foo is modified between<br>&gt; the conditional binding and the force-unwrap, the force-unwrap could fail.<br>&gt; Sure, that can’t happen when foo is a local variable like this, but if it<br>&gt; were a property of a class then it could.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Moreover, the proposed “solution” has the same concurrency failure, but<br>&gt; hides it even worse because the force-unwrap operator doesn’t even appear<br>&gt; in the code:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; var foo:A? = A()<br>&gt; if foo != nil {<br>&gt;    foo.someMethod()          // Bad news!<br>&gt;    foo.someMutatingMethod()  // Bad news!<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In summary, I do not see sufficient motivation for this proposal. The<br>&gt; motivation which I do see appears superfluous. The problem being described<br>&gt; already has an elegant solution in Swift. And the proposed changes<br>&gt; introduce an exceptionally taxing cognitive burden on developers just to<br>&gt; figure out what the type of a variable is on any given line of code.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Plus, in the face of concurrency, such implicit type-narrowing has the<br>&gt; potential to hide serious issues.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Nevin<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Thu, Nov 3, 2016 at 1:04 PM, Haravikk via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; To avoid hijacking the guard let x = x thread entirely I&#39;ve decided to try<br>&gt; to write up a proposal on type narrowing in Swift.<br>&gt; Please give your feedback on the functionality proposed, as well as the<br>&gt; clarity of the proposal/examples themselves; I&#39;ve tried to keep it<br>&gt; straightforward, but I do tend towards being overly verbose, I&#39;ve always<br>&gt; tried to have the examples build upon one another to show how it all stacks<br>&gt; up.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Type Narrowing<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - Proposal: SE-NNNN<br>&gt;    &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/NNNN-type-narrowing.md&gt;<br>&gt;    - Author: Haravikk &lt;https://github.com/haravikk&gt;<br>&gt;    - Status: Awaiting review<br>&gt;    - Review manager: TBD<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals#introduction&gt;<br>&gt; Introduction<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This proposal is to introduce type-narrowing to Swift, enabling the<br>&gt; type-checker to automatically infer a narrower type from context such as<br>&gt; conditionals.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Swift-evolution thread: Discussion thread topic for that proposal<br>&gt; &lt;http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals#motivation&gt;<br>&gt; Motivation<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Currently in Swift there are various pieces of boilerplate required in<br>&gt; order to manually narrow types.

Otherwise if you know you&#39;ve narrowed the type, then you can do things with that narrowed type and either the type-checker will allow it, or inform you that it&#39;s not possible, thus warning you that your conditional(s) etc. don&#39;t work as intended.<br></p><p>Really the burden is no different to the techniques that already exist; if you&#39;ve tested a value with `is` then you know what the type is within that block of code, this is just ensuring that the type checker also knows it.

The most obvious is in the case of polymorphism:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; let foo:A = B() // B extends A<br>&gt;&gt; if foo is B {<br>&gt;&gt;     (foo as B).someMethodSpecificToB()<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; But also in the case of unwrapping of optionals:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; var foo:A? = A()<br>&gt;&gt; if var foo = foo { // foo is now unwrapped and shadowed<br>&gt;&gt;     foo.someMethod()<br>&gt;&gt;     foo!.someMutatingMethod() // Can&#39;t be done<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals#proposed-solution&gt;Proposed solution<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The proposed solution to the boiler-plate is to introduce type-narrowing, essentially a finer grained knowledge of type based upon context. Thus as any contextual clue indicating a more or less specific type are encountered, the type of the variable will reflect this from that point onwards.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals#detailed-design&gt;Detailed design<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The concept of type-narrowing would essentially treat all variables as having not just a single type, but instead as having a stack of increasingly specific (narrow) types.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Whenever a contextual clue such as a conditional is encountered, the type checker will infer whether this narrows the type, and add the new narrow type to the stack from that point onwards. Whenever the type widens again narrower types are popped from the stack.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Here are the above examples re-written to take advantage of type-narrowing:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; let foo:A = B() // B extends A<br>&gt;&gt; if foo is B { // B is added to foo&#39;s type stack<br>&gt;&gt;     foo.someMethodSpecificToB()<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; // B is popped from foo&#39;s type stack<br>&gt;&gt; var foo:A? = A()<br>&gt;&gt; if foo != nil { // Optional&lt;A&gt;.some is added to foo&#39;s type stack<br>&gt;&gt;    foo.someMethod()<br>&gt;&gt;    foo.someMutatingMethod() // Can modify mutable original<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; // Optional&lt;A&gt;.some is popped from foo&#39;s type stack<br>&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals#enum-types&gt;Enum Types<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; As seen in the simple optional example, to implement optional support each case in an enum is considered be a unique sub-type of the enum itself, thus allowing narrowing to nil (.none) and non-nil (.some) types.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; This behaviour actually enables some other useful behaviours, specifically, if a value is known to be either nil or non-nil then the need to unwrap or force unwrap the value can be eliminated entirely, with the compiler able to produce errors if these are used incorrectly, for example:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; var foo:A? = A()<br>&gt;&gt; foo.someMethod() // A is non-nil, no operators required!<br>&gt;&gt; foo = nil<br>&gt;&gt; foo!.someMethod() // Error: foo is always nil at this point<br>&gt;&gt; However, unwrapping of the value is only possible if the case contains either no value at all, or contains a single value able to satisfy the variable&#39;s original type requirements. In other words, the value stored in Optional&lt;A&gt;.some satisfies the type requirements of var foo:A?, thus it is implicitly unwrapped for use. For general enums this likely means no cases are implicitly unwrapped unless using a type of Any.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals#type-widening&gt;Type Widening<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; In some cases a type may be narrowed, only to be used in a way that makes no sense for the narrowed type. In cases such as these the operation is tested against each type in the stack to determine whether the type must instead be widened. If a widened type is found it is selected (with re-narrowing where possible) otherwise an error is produced as normal.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; For example:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; let foo:A? = A()<br>&gt;&gt; if (foo != nil) { // Type of foo is Optional&lt;A&gt;.some<br>&gt;&gt;     foo.someMethod()<br>&gt;&gt;     foo = nil // Type of foo is widened to Optional&lt;A&gt;, then re-narrowed to Optional&lt;A&gt;.none<br>&gt;&gt; } // Type of foo is Optional&lt;A&gt;.none<br>&gt;&gt; foo.someMethod() // Error: foo is always nil at this point<br>&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals#multiple-conditions-and-branching&gt;Multiple Conditions and Branching<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; When dealing with complex conditionals or branches, all paths must agree on a common type for narrowing to occur. For example:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; let foo:A? = B() // B extends A<br>&gt;&gt; let bar:C = C() // C extends B<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; if (foo != nil) || (foo == bar) { // Optional&lt;A&gt;.some is added to foo&#39;s type stack<br>&gt;&gt;     if foo is B { // Optional&lt;B&gt;.some is added to foo&#39;s type stack<br>&gt;&gt;         foo.someMethodSpecificToB()<br>&gt;&gt;     } // Optional&lt;B&gt;.some is popped from foo&#39;s type stack<br>&gt;&gt;     foo = nil // Type of foo is re-narrowed as Optional&lt;A&gt;.none<br>&gt;&gt; } // Type of foo is Optional&lt;A&gt;.none in all branches<br>&gt;&gt; foo.someMethod() // Error: foo is always nil at this point<br>&gt;&gt; Here we can see that the extra condition (foo == bar) does not prevent type-narrowing, as the variable bar cannot be nil so both conditions require a type of Optional&lt;A&gt;.some as a minimum.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; In this example foo is also nil at the end of both branches, thus its type can remain narrowed past this point.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals#context-triggers&gt;Context Triggers<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Trigger	Impact<br>&gt;&gt; as	Explicitly narrows a type with as! failing and as? narrowing to Type? instead when this is not possible.<br>&gt;&gt; is	Anywhere a type is tested will allow the type-checker to infer the new type if there was a match (and other conditions agree).<br>&gt;&gt; case	Any form of exhaustive test on an enum type allows it to be narrowed either to that case or the opposite, e.g- foo != nil eliminates .none, leaving only .some as the type, which can then be implicitly unwrapped (see Enum Types above).<br>&gt;&gt; =	Assigning a value to a type will either narrow it if the new value is a sub-type, or will trigger widening to find a new common type, before attempting to re-narrow from there.<br>&gt;&gt; There may be other triggers that should be considered.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals#impact-on-existing-code&gt;Impact on existing code<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Although this change is technically additive, it will impact any code in which there are currently errors that type-narrowing would have detected; for example, attempting to manipulate a predictably nil value.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals#alternatives-considered&gt;Alternatives considered<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; One of the main advantages of type-narrowing is that it functions as an alternative to other features. This includes alternative syntax for shadowing/unwrapping of optionals, in which case type-narrowing allows an optional to be implicitly unwrapped simply by testing it, and without the need to introduce any new syntax.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt; <br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20161103/85c3cc78/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8149b5bd66abbc94babfda2995153481?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal] Type Narrowing</strong> from <string>Nevin Brackett-Rozinsky</string> &lt;nevin.brackettrozinsky at gmail.com&gt;<p>November  3, 2016 at 06:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Okay, I think I found an actual shortcoming that type narrowing might<br>address, namely mutating a property in place if it is a subtype.

I use “x: Int” as a minimal example, but any solution should also<br>work for more complex scenarios.<br></p><p>Now suppose we wish to test whether “c.a” is of type B, and if so change<br>its “x” value. We could, of course, make a local copy, mutate it, and<br>reassign to “c.a”. But if those operations are expensive we would rather<br>avoid doing so. And if B uses copy-on-write, we would want to remove the<br>value from “c” entirely so that we hopefully have a unique reference. This<br>is hard to get right.<br></p><p>We would prefer to write something like the following:<br></p><p>(c.a as?

Otherwise if you know you&#39;ve narrowed the type,<br>&gt; then you can do things with that narrowed type and either the type-checker<br>&gt; will allow it, or inform you that it&#39;s not possible, thus warning you that<br>&gt; your conditional(s) etc. don&#39;t work as intended.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Really the burden is no different to the techniques that already exist; if<br>&gt; you&#39;ve tested a value with `is` then *you* know what the type is within<br>&gt; that block of code, this is just ensuring that the type checker also knows<br>&gt; it. Likewise with an optional, if you test that it&#39;s not nil then you know<br>&gt; it&#39;s not, and so should the type-checker.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I should probably put more under motivation about why this feature works<br>&gt; for the example cases given, and what the impact is on a larger scale; as<br>&gt; the narrowing has the potential to pick up a bunch of little errors that<br>&gt; standard type-checking alone may not, the trick is coming up with the<br>&gt; example code to show it that isn&#39;t enormous, as I&#39;m trying to avoid too<br>&gt; much complexity in the Motivation section so I can build up the examples;<br>&gt; maybe I&#39;ll add an &quot;Advantages&quot; section further down to detail more of what<br>&gt; can be done *after* demonstrating the feature in stages, rather than trying<br>&gt; to do it at the start.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; the proposed “solution” has the same concurrency failure, but hides it<br>&gt; even worse because the force-unwrap operator doesn’t even appear in the<br>&gt; code:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; var foo:A? = A()<br>&gt; if foo != nil {<br>&gt;    foo.someMethod()          // Bad news!<br>&gt;    foo.someMutatingMethod()  // Bad news!<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Actually the issue *is* visible in the code; it&#39;s the conditional. If you<br>&gt; can&#39;t trust `foo` not to change then testing its value and then acting upon<br>&gt; the result without some form of local copy or locking is the part that<br>&gt; explicitly isn&#39;t thread safe.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I&#39;m not really sure of the need to focus on thread safety issues here as<br>&gt; I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re unique to this feature, or even to optionals; anything<br>&gt; that is part of a shared class and thus potentially shared with other<br>&gt; threads is unsafe, whether it&#39;s optional or not.

For example:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; let foo:A? = B() // B extends A<br>&gt;&gt; let bar:C = C() // C extends B<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; if (foo != nil) || (foo == bar) { // Optional&lt;A&gt;.some is added to foo&#39;s type stack<br>&gt;&gt;     if foo is B { // Optional&lt;B&gt;.some is added to foo&#39;s type stack<br>&gt;&gt;         foo.someMethodSpecificToB()<br>&gt;&gt;     } // Optional&lt;B&gt;.some is popped from foo&#39;s type stack<br>&gt;&gt;     foo = nil // Type of foo is re-narrowed as Optional&lt;A&gt;.none<br>&gt;&gt; } // Type of foo is Optional&lt;A&gt;.none in all branches<br>&gt;&gt; foo.someMethod() // Error: foo is always nil at this point<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Here we can see that the extra condition (foo == bar) does not prevent<br>&gt;&gt; type-narrowing, as the variable bar cannot be nil so both conditions<br>&gt;&gt; require a type of Optional&lt;A&gt;.some as a minimum.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; In this example foo is also nil at the end of both branches, thus its<br>&gt;&gt; type can remain narrowed past this point.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals#context-triggers&gt;Context<br>&gt;&gt; Triggers<br>&gt;&gt; TriggerImpact<br>&gt;&gt; as Explicitly narrows a type with as! failing and as? narrowing to Type? instead<br>&gt;&gt; when this is not possible.<br>&gt;&gt; is Anywhere a type is tested will allow the type-checker to infer the<br>&gt;&gt; new type if there was a match (and other conditions agree).<br>&gt;&gt; case Any form of exhaustive test on an enum type allows it to be<br>&gt;&gt; narrowed either to that case or the opposite, e.g- foo != nil eliminates<br>&gt;&gt; .none, leaving only .some as the type, which can then be implicitly<br>&gt;&gt; unwrapped (see Enum Types above).<br>&gt;&gt; = Assigning a value to a type will either narrow it if the new value is<br>&gt;&gt; a sub-type, or will trigger widening to find a new common type, before<br>&gt;&gt; attempting to re-narrow from there.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; There may be other triggers that should be considered.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals#impact-on-existing-code&gt;Impact<br>&gt;&gt; on existing code<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Although this change is technically additive, it will impact any code in<br>&gt;&gt; which there are currently errors that type-narrowing would have detected;<br>&gt;&gt; for example, attempting to manipulate a predictably nil value.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &lt;https://github.com/Haravikk/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals#alternatives-considered&gt;Alternatives<br>&gt;&gt; considered<br>&gt;&gt; One of the main advantages of type-narrowing is that it functions as an<br>&gt;&gt; alternative to other features.

Here is a small example setup:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; protocol A { var x: Int {get} }<br>&gt; struct B: A { var x: Int }<br>&gt; struct C { var a: A }<br>&gt; var c = C(a: B(x: 4))<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Note that “A” does not promise the “x” property will be mutable, while B does. I use “x: Int” as a minimal example, but any solution should also work for more complex scenarios.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Now suppose we wish to test whether “c.a” is of type B, and if so change its “x” value. We could, of course, make a local copy, mutate it, and reassign to “c.a”. But if those operations are expensive we would rather avoid doing so. And if B uses copy-on-write, we would want to remove the value from “c” entirely so that we hopefully have a unique reference. This is hard to get right.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We would prefer to write something like the following:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; (c.a as? B)?.x = 12<br>&gt; <br>&gt; But that does not currently work, resulting in the error “Cannot assign to immutable expression of type &#39;Int&#39;”.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Will the proposed type-narrowing feature provide a simple way to mutate “c.a” in place, contingent upon its being of type B?<br>&gt; How does it compare to an alternative such as inout return values, which could preserve mutability in the above?<br></p><p>That&#39;s a good example, and yes it should be possible for type-narrowing to simplify stuff like this, I&#39;ll add a section on that I should probably go into more detail on how I intend working with narrowed mutable values to work, as for the advantage vs inout it&#39;s really just a matter of simplicity I think; using type narrowing should allow it to just work without having to pass to methods or design the API specifically for that kind of thing.<br></p><p><br></p><p>&gt; If we are going to have any sort of type narrowing, I would strongly prefer that it be explicit. For example we could use a keyword such as “rebind” to narrow the type of an existing symbol in a scope:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; if rebind c.a as B {<br>&gt;     c.a.x = 12<br>&gt; }<br></p><p>I don&#39;t see what&#39;s really gained by making it explicit vs implicit; if the condition was c.a is B then I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;s any less clear?<br></p><p>&gt; Furthermore, I think the proposal to treat enum cases as types is a major change to Swift’s type system, and probably introduces many unforeseen headaches. It also smells somewhat of a backdoor way for union types to sneak into the language.<br></p><p>I&#39;d say that in a sense enums are types, after all they can have unique associated value types of their own. Really though my intent is primarily to support optionals, but I figure it makes sense to try and do it from the perspective of general purpose enums since that&#39;s all optionals really are anyway.<br></p><p><br>Also, I&#39;ve been thinking about thread safety and it occurs to me that type narrowing could actually be of significant benefit to it, rather than a detriment.<br></p><p>Consider:<br></p><p>	struct Foo { var value:Int }<br>	struct Bar { var foo?:Foo }<br></p><p>	var a = Foo(value: 5)<br>	var b = Bar(foo: a)<br></p><p>	b.foo.value = 10<br></p><p>Now, in this case we&#39;re only dealing with structs, and we know that b.foo has a value, thus b.foo.value is nice and safe; in fact no force unwrapping needs to occur behind the scenes, it can optimise away completely.<br></p><p>Instead, let&#39;s assume Bar is a class we&#39;re handling in a potentially shared way:<br></p><p>	class Bar { var foo?:Foo }<br></p><p>	func myMethod(bar:Bar) {<br>		b.foo = new Foo(5) // We now know that b.foo shouldn&#39;t be nil<br>		b.foo!.value = 10<br>	}<br></p><p>In this case, since Bar is a class we don&#39;t have total control over, we can&#39;t be certain that b.foo is non-nil when we try to modify it a second time; as a result, type-narrowing won&#39;t occur (because it&#39;s a class from another scope), however, because the type-checker knows that bar.foo should have a value, we can actually issue a more informative error message if force unwrapping fails, e.g- concurrent modification error.<br></p><p>In other words, we can potentially use it to help detect concurrency issues. It&#39;s another thing that&#39;s going to require a section on the proposal though, I have a feeling it&#39;s going to get pretty big!<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20161106/142f6771/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3488bcf34d8c45d917ed27d67a0ffa45?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal] Type Narrowing</strong> from <string>David Hart</string> &lt;david at hartbit.com&gt;<p>November  9, 2016 at 07:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On 3 Nov 2016, at 20:23, Nevin Brackett-Rozinsky via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This looks like a lot of complexity for very little gain.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Aside from any implementation concerns, this proposal substantially increases the cognitive load on developers.

To figure out what a piece of code means, someone reading it will have to mentally keep track of a “type stack” for every variable. That is the opposite of “clarity at the point of use”.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Very well said. I think this is perhaps the number one complaint I have about the proposal.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Did you see my response to this? There should be no particular cognitive load increase; think of the feature like type inference, the idea here is that the type-checker is gaining the same knowledge that you already have, i.e- you know something isn&#39;t nil, so the type-checker should too.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Locally in short routines yes.<br>&gt;&gt; But in larger modules and non-local this does not apply.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m not sure what you mean; type-narrowing doesn&#39;t occur across scopes, ultimately you will always have some starting type where the variable was declared as a property, function argument or local variable, and it is narrow only where it is used, and the narrowing only occurs within that scope for as long as it is relevant.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In other words, the narrowing is always local. If you know your method takes an optional string for example then you know that that variable is still an optional string throughout that method, type-narrowing just helps to guarantee that it is nil or non-nil where you expect it to be.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Imo it should always be possible to look at a type declaration and -from that- derive all necessary knowledge about the type.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; As I say, narrowing never changes the type; if you have a variable with a declared type of Foo, that is narrowed to Bar, then it is because Bar extends Foo and thus is compatible with it, giving you access to any additional methods of Bar without interfering with what you know of Foo.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Besides when using a narrowed type as a parameter for an optional it must be automatically be widened again? hence you would mentally keep track of the status of that variable.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m not sure I follow this question; do you mean something like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	func someMethod(foo:Foo?) {<br>&gt; 		var bar:Foo? = nil // bar is Optional&lt;Foo&gt;.none<br>&gt; 		if (foo != nil) { // foo is Optional&lt;Foo&gt;.some<br>&gt; 			bar = foo // both foo and bar are Optional&lt;Foo&gt;.some<br>&gt; 		}<br>&gt; 		// both foo and bar are Optional&lt;Foo&gt; (alternative branch places no mutual guarantee on type)<br>&gt; 		if bar != nil { // bar is Optional&lt;Foo&gt;.some<br>&gt; 			bar.someMutatingMethod()<br>&gt; 		}<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; But these are all things that the developer knows; bar can&#39;t be non-nil until a value for it is set, foo is definitely non-nil within the block etc. The only difference here is that instead of the developer having to use ! unnecessarily (or risk making a mistake) they can just use their knowledge of what it is to interact directly, as the type-checker will now also know the same thing.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; However, with the Optional&lt;T&gt; to T method shadowing issue it seems we probably will need to require a keyword, or at the very least restrict automatic narrowing to polymorphism. For optionals the code will have to look something like this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	func someMethod(foo:Foo?) {<br>&gt; 		var bar:Foo? = nil<br>&gt; 		if unwrap foo {<br>&gt; 			bar = foo<br>&gt; 		}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 		if unwrap bar {<br>&gt; 			bar.someMutatingMethod()<br>&gt; 		}<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The difference here is that unlike shadowing (if let foo = foo), if foo were mutable then it could still be mutated directly, no need to do it with force unwrapping.

This is like your foo.value example from the proposal.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I don’t think you can get around the fact that the compiler can’t guarantee a type-narrowed or even unwrapped mutable value, which is why if let works as it does with an immutable snapshot.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; However, type narrowing for immutable values would still be good.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; This isn&#39;t a problem of mutability, it&#39;s a problem due to the use of a reference type (Person); this is what the classes and concurrency section is supposed to be describing, but perhaps I haven&#39;t made it clear enough. So in the example you&#39;ve given self.pet can&#39;t be unwrapped because self is a reference type, thus you need to either use force unwrapping either with the unwrap! keyword or direct force unwrapping like you&#39;ve used (since behind the scenes it&#39;s the same thing).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; You are right though that the resulting error isn&#39;t necessarily a concurrency issue, so I&#39;ll make a note of this for the proposed new error, and also clarify that the reference type restriction doesn&#39;t just apply to the property itself, but also to whatever it belongs to (and so-on up the chain, so if any part of foo.bar.a.b.c is a reference type it can&#39;t be soft unwrapped).<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20161113/bde58d33/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4de621aec7ff90a03f5b9b21e790bc66?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal] Type Narrowing</strong> from <string>Dennis Lysenko</string> &lt;dennis.s.lysenko at gmail.com&gt;<p>November 14, 2016 at 02:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>Jean-Daniel, I agree with the first part of your assessment fully, which in<br>my opinion is actually why I think the Kotlin style combined with the Swift<br>style would pull in the best of both worlds and create a complete solution.<br>I do share some of your reservation in the second part of your assessment,<br>which is why I&#39;m a little hesitant on the proposal, but as I&#39;ve described<br>before I think it would help expressiveness.<br></p><p>On Sun, Nov 13, 2016 at 11:16 AM Jean-Daniel &lt;dev at xenonium.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Le 13 nov. 2016 à 03:37, Dennis Lysenko via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That&#39;s a good point in Jay&#39;s example and from what I can tell a good way<br>&gt; to address it, Haravikk.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I&#39;ve done some work in a language that only provides type narrowing for<br>&gt; immutable types (that&#39;d be Kotlin as I&#39;ve mentioned before) and whenever<br>&gt; I&#39;ve used it it feels like the only thing it&#39;s really been missing is the<br>&gt; &quot;if let&quot; construct allowing you to bind and unwrap mutable values, which<br>&gt; leads me to think that synergistically, in Swift, this would be fantastic.<br>&gt; The main benefit probably is that it would allow code to read much better.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; IMHO, the Kotlin solution is flaw.

There&#39;s<br>&gt; little to no mental overhead in either of those cases, as your &quot;type stack&quot;<br>&gt; is simply 2-long (this was an Int? outside of this conditional block, and<br>&gt; it&#39;s an Int inside. This was a UIViewController outside of this conditional<br>&gt; block, and it&#39;s a UINavigationController inside.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; While it may not be a panacea that allows new applications that no one<br>&gt; could have thought of, I have no doubt that it would greatly improve the<br>&gt; experience of coding in the language by, as you said, allowing more<br>&gt; flexibility in expressiveness. Regardless of one&#39;s opinion on the efficacy<br>&gt; of this feature as a whole, there *are* frequent situations where this<br>&gt; feature leads to substantially better-reading code. The &quot;unwrap&quot; keyword<br>&gt; proposed in another thread, critically, solves only *half* of the<br>&gt;  problems that this proposal solves (as far as I could tell from reading a<br>&gt; few emails in the chain, it left the subclass inference completely<br>&gt; untouched). Ability to say &quot;if (controller is SongSelectionViewController)<br>&gt; { controller.search(for: &quot;mozart&quot;) }&quot; is mentally freeing and helps me stay<br>&gt; in coder zen.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; IMO, it would effectively be the cream cheese icing on the top of the<br>&gt; carrot cake of Swift&#39;s unwrapping and type inference features.

Put another way; when you force unwrap/narrow a reference type, it is treated like an implicitly unwrapped Optional or implicitly narrowed type, so is checked for correctness as necessary.<br></p><p>Since narrowing/unwrapping has (sort of) occurred, we can produce an error that better highlights the problem, e.g- &quot;Force unwrapped reference was set to nil by another method or thread&quot;, as the unwrap/narrowing functionality ensures that you can&#39;t do it in the current scope without it being detected. The error that requires you to use force unwrapping/narrowing can likewise be more specific, e.g- &quot;Reference type foo cannot be unwrapped/narrowed safely&quot; (I suck at writing error messages btw), the idea being to encourage developers to consider why and decide for themselves whether it&#39;s better to force the unwrap/narrowing (because they&#39;re confident it will work) or to instead work with a copy and put it back later, use locking etc. etc.<br></p><p>The only other component is an attribute to indicate when a reference is safe; I&#39;m favouring something like @concurrency(safe), but the difficulty is whether it&#39;s enough to just indicate this or if it also needs to be enforced somehow. I might use the attribute for example on a property I know will be used in a copy-on-write style, but is it feasible to enforce that, perhaps with some kind of behaviour similar to no-escape? It becomes tough to consider every possible case for something like that, and it&#39;d probably need some other supporting features, like a @copy attribute for return types so we can account for methods methods that produce a new copy of an instance (e.g- if your return type has the @copy attribute then it can&#39;t return self). It&#39;s probably more of a separate proposal though for how we&#39;ll handle concurrency and reference types natively.<br></p><p>Little bit off track there, but the short version is; forcing the unwrap/narrowing doesn&#39;t make your code any more or less safe for references, it just removes the need for force-unwrap or type check everything manually.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20161115/16c13456/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8149b5bd66abbc94babfda2995153481?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal] Type Narrowing</strong> from <string>Nevin Brackett-Rozinsky</string> &lt;nevin.brackettrozinsky at gmail.com&gt;<p>November  7, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>The more I think about it, the more I realize what I actually want is an<br>“alias” or “view” or “lens” that will let me give a new name to an existing<br>entity, without copying or moving it.<br></p><p>This is useful in general if you need to work “down the rabbit hole”, so<br>you could write something like:<br></p><p>alias size = anArray[idx].someProperty.size<br>// Work with “size” as a shorthand, including mutations<br></p><p>In the situation from my previous example, where we only want to take<br>action when the nested property is a certain type, it might look like:<br></p><p>if alias b = c.a as?

You didn’t mention it, but the ?: operator is a specific example<br>&gt; that frequently comes up.  People often expect to be able to do something<br>&gt; like:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         … = foo is B ? foo.bMethod() : …<br>&gt;<br>&gt; which is the same sort of flow sensitive type refinement as you’re<br>&gt; proposing here.  This topic also came up in the design discussion around<br>&gt; #available (which shipped in Swift 2, but was discussed much earlier),<br>&gt; because unavailable decls could be available as optionals when not<br>&gt; specifically checked for.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This is just MHO, but while I have been in favor of this in the (distant)<br>&gt; past, I became convinced that this would be a bad idea when it comes to<br>&gt; code maintenance over the long term.  With our current (intentional<br>&gt; shadowing based) design, you can always jump to the definition of a value<br>&gt; to see where it was defined, and definitions always specify a type.<br>&gt; Introducing flow senstitive type refinement breaks this model because the<br>&gt; type of a decl depends not just on its declaration, but on a potentially<br>&gt; arbitrary number of imperative checks that occur between the declaration<br>&gt; and the use.  This can make it much more difficult to understand code.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -Chris<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20161107/fec07a9e/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
