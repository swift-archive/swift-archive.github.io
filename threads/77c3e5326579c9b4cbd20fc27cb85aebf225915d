I recently used the CFNotificationCenter APIs, where I needed an UnsafePointer from an Unmanaged and the process was a bit surprising. Good to know first off I was even doing it the correct way, and I think this change substantially improves it.<br>	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?Yes, I imagine the use case of a pointer is the most wanted.<br>	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?Each part with Unmanaged and UnsafePointer seem well thought out and logical, and this change fits in well.<br>	* If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?The only language I can think of is Objective-C, and I think this matches the flow of __bridge and const void * well. <br>Patrick<br></p><p>  <br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160428/5e3a4b44/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fe87aed0d64cdbc46378bf7596a7553?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0017: Change Unmanaged to use UnsafePointer</strong> from <string>Andrew Trick</string> &lt;atrick at apple.com&gt;<p>April 28, 2016 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Apr 28, 2016, at 11:10 AM, Chris Lattner &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The review of &quot;SE-0017: Change Unmanaged to use UnsafePointer&quot; begins now and runs through May 3.

My concern was that UnsafePointer&lt;Void&gt; is probably not the right type for opaque pointers. I didn’t want users to begin rewriting COpaquePointer APIs with UnsafePointer&lt;Void&gt;, then force them to rewrite the same calls again back to some other opaque pointer type once we decide what that should be. I was hoping to sidestep my concerns and meet the goal of reduced syntax, but my suggestion was nonsense.<br></p><p>I can start a separate thread next week on replacing UnsafePointer&lt;Void&gt; and see where that goes. This proposal is probably fine as-is, but there might be less impact for users if we change the imported void* type first. <br></p><p>-Andy<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160430/014a20e5/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d4fb9162c777a5d6d0b1fb00893d709?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0017: Change Unmanaged to use UnsafePointer</strong> from <string>Haravikk</string> &lt;swift-evolution at haravikk.me&gt;<p>April 29, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On 28 Apr 2016, at 19:10, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>Positive, while working with pointers should be avoided, when you have no choice it’s better for them to be as easy as possible to minimise errors, even if we can’t eliminate them completely (since that’s the risk with pointers).<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes.
