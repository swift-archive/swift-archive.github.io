Allow behaviours to specify abstract members that need to be implemented (akin to protocols) and get the initial value of lazy from there, e.g.:<br></p><p>    var lazy x : T {<br>	func load() {<br>		return 33<br>	}<br>    }<br></p><p>  Pros: clean and clear. Cons: verbosity.<br></p><p>2. Allow behaviours to have members stored per property declaration and not per property instance. These members are tied to the type-level storage of the host item (e.g. class and not instance). A closure that initialises the lazy storage can be stored at that level, thus solving the storage overhead issue. One can use the static declarations for this (although a new storage class might be appropriate). Note that Python uses this kind of approach per default: instances of property descriptors are created per class that hosts a property and not per instance. The property getter/setter then receives the specific object instance to manipulate the value specific to that instance. <br></p><p> Pros: clean and clear.

So in the end, it is magic that wraps the initialiser expression in a per-declaration closure. I’d rather such things be under full programmer control. Even more, what would happen in the following case?<br></p><p>public behavior var [custom] _: Value = initialValue {<br>  var value: Value = initialValue // alternatively init() { value = initialValue} <br>  get<br>  {<br>   return value<br>  }<br>  set<br>  {<br>    value = newValue<br>  }<br>}<br></p><p>var global_x = 1<br></p><p>class Test {<br> var [custom] x : Int = global_x + 1<br>}<br></p><p>let t1 = Test()<br>print(t1.x)<br>global_x = 2<br>let t2 = Test()<br>print(t2.x) // 2 or 3???<br></p><p><br>What gets printed in the last line? If I read the proposal correctly (but by now I expect to have missed something AGAIN in all honestly), the initialValue expression is gets wrapped in a computed property. This property is first accessed when the storage is initialised, i.e. when the host object instance is constructed. This means that t1 and t2 should get two different initial values which is probably not what one would have intended. Implicit wrapping of the initialiser is a good idea if we are interested in the lazy behaviour but it could be a source of bugs if we are *not*. <br></p><p>— Taras<br></p><p><br>&gt; On 14 Feb 2016, at 11:58, Brent Royal-Gordon &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Ah, yes, sorry, should have double checked with the initial text before sending the message.
