This couldn’t have happened without the awesome work and enormous support of the Swift community, especially @zhuowei and @modocache, others including William Dillon for his work on the Raspberry Pi port, and various members of the Apple Swift team for answering questions along the way. I want to take this opportunity to send a big thank you to all of you for this here!<br></p><p>In order to give something back to the community, I wrote some posts about the experience with the hope of encouraging more to give it a try themselves. If you’re interested in the idea of using Swift on Android, I’d be delighted if you took the time (about 15-20mins in total) to read the posts and share / recommend them. Here they are:<br></p><p>1. Why we put an app in the Android Play Store using Swift &lt;https://medium.com/@ephemer/why-we-put-an-app-in-the-android-play-store-using-swift-96ac87c88dfc#.g9ar12e50&gt; (mostly non-technical)<br>2. How we put an app in the Android Play Store using Swift &lt;https://medium.com/@ephemer/how-we-put-an-app-in-the-android-play-store-using-swift-67bd99573e3c#.v60v3peru&gt; (more technical, with code examples)<br>3. Using JNI in Swift to put an app into the Android Play Store &lt;https://medium.com/@ephemer/using-jni-in-swift-to-put-an-app-into-the-android-play-store-732e542a99dd#.s67rhrvrt&gt; (very technical, first principles)<br></p><p>I’d be happy to answer any questions here or in the comments sections there. Have a great Sunday!<br></p><p>In gratitude,<br>Geordie<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160717/1345b580/attachment.html&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>A non-text attachment was scrubbed...<br>Name: signature.asc<br>Type: application/pgp-signature<br>Size: 455 bytes<br>Desc: Message signed with OpenPGP using GPGMail<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160717/1345b580/attachment.sig&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
