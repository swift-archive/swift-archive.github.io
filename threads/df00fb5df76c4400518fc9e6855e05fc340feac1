The proposal has been accepted.<br></p><p>Feedback was very light, but generally positive.  A number of important points were raised and workflow ideas were suggested off-list, but since they refer to additional enhancements, we feel that they are best handled through additional proposals rather than modifications to this one.  Such enhancements include the ability to version multiple packages together, and to allow for a search-path style list of Packages directories.<br></p><p>The accepted proposal can be found at https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0082-swiftpm-package-edit.md &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0082-swiftpm-package-edit.md&gt;.<br></p><p>We have not yet scheduled the implementation of this feature.<br></p><p>Thank you all for your comments.<br></p><p>Anders<br>Review Manager<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160510/df00eac1/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
