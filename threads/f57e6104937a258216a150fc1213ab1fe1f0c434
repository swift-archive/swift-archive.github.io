It&#39;s definitely very<br>&gt;&gt; different grammatically from most other API guidelines, but so are<br>&gt;&gt; Objective-C&#39;s guidelines.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;<br>&gt; Sure, but I&#39;d actually argue that the noun-labels in ObjC are what<br>&gt; actually provide the context of the non-mutating nature of the<br>&gt; function. <br></p><p>I disagree with that assertion.  The nouns tell you what type is going<br>to be returned and what type is being passed, not whether there will be<br>mutation to the receiver.<br></p><p>&gt; The -ed/-ing suffixes are a by-product of the preceding noun-phrase<br>&gt; and/or trailing preposition.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet(_:)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; We are taking information about the returned data out of the function<br>&gt; name and assuming that the return type makes up for it.<br></p><p>The return type and context, yes.  <br>&gt; trimming(_:)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; For a string-type, that may be ok, but I&#39;d argue that `trimming` is<br>&gt; significantly more ambiguous that the ObjC version. There is no<br>&gt; reasonable assumption that `stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet` would<br>&gt; ever mutate the caller. However, `trimming` carries no such<br>&gt; implication _unless_ you are well versed in the API guidelines, <br></p><p>I disagree with that assertion.  We didn&#39;t invent that usage out of thin<br>air; it&#39;s based on regular English usage.  Neither of these names really<br>directly addresses mutation at all; to do that you&#39;d have to append<br>&quot;WithoutChangingSelf&quot; or something.<br></p><p>It seems like you may (quite reasonably) associate having a return value<br>with being non-mutating, and you may be making the conclusion that<br>removing information about the return type removes any implication that<br>there *is* a returned value.  But there are still lots of clues left<br>about that:<br></p><p>* the call forms a noun phrase, therefore must be non-side-effectful, so<br>  to be useful must return something.<br>* unused result warnings ensure that the fact that it returns a value is<br>  quite visible at the call site.<br></p><p>&gt; and even then, I&#39;d still argue that your confidence level between the<br>&gt; two versions is not equal.<br></p><p>I understand that you may be less confident with APIs written according<br>to the new guidelines.<br></p><p>&gt; A counter example for -ing usage: if we have a streaming-type and<br>&gt; `trimming` is actually the process for continually removing those<br>&gt; characters from the stream. The likely implementation of this is going<br>&gt; to be a mutating function that fires events, or maybe it&#39;s a<br>&gt; promise-like API that wraps the event handling differently. The<br>&gt; corollary is that `trim` would actually be the one that produces no<br>&gt; side-effects as it would be able to give a snapshot of the current<br>&gt; state of a trimmed stream.<br></p><p>I don&#39;t believe this is actually a confusable scenario; please show us<br>what that code looks like.<br></p><p>&gt; I think we are opening ourselves up to the potential of many confusing<br>&gt; APIs when an -ed/-ing form of a function name is an appropriate<br>&gt; candidate with the opposite meaning that the guidelines set out.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The -ed/-ing suffix choice doesn&#39;t seem outright bad, but it does seem<br>&gt; to be &quot;death by paper cuts&quot; bad, at least to me. The guidelines are<br>&gt; already a bit complicated in this area. Also, like others, I find the<br>&gt; -ing suffix to imply a state of work to be done that will be completed<br>&gt; later or cover an extended amount of time; mutation has no bearing on<br>&gt; the implementation choice here.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Side note: the guidelines are also unintentionally narrow: &quot;Use the<br>&gt; “ed/ing” rule to name the nonmutating counterpart of a mutating<br>&gt; method.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; We should *always* be following this pattern regardless of the<br>&gt; existence of a nonmutating counterpart. Otherwise, if you implement<br>&gt; just a non-mutating function for sorting without the counterpart, you<br>&gt; need to use a noun-phrase, like `sortBy`. Then if you later add a<br>&gt; mutating version, you need to rename the `sortBy` to `sorted`. That<br>&gt; seems like the wrong outcome of the guidelines.<br></p><p>I think you&#39;re confused: `sortBy(x)`—or more properly, `sort(by:<br>x)`—isn&#39;t a noun-phrase; it&#39;s an imperative verb phrase, so it would be<br>an ineligible form for a nonmutating method call.<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4fe988326eed161b989d0c5521cb105?s=50"></div><header><strong>API Guidelines Update</strong> from <string>Jordan Rose</string> &lt;jordan_rose at apple.com&gt;<p>February 24, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Feb 24, 2016, at 11:25, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; on Wed Feb 24 2016, David Owens II &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Feb 22, 2016, at 11:02 AM, Jordan Rose via swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; In case it&#39;s been lost in all the discussion, the -ing/-ed rule is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; essentially the rule Objective-C uses, minus the noun labels for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; return value and types and the word &quot;by&quot;.

This is part of the established Cocoa convention and is (sort of) called out &lt;https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/Articles/NamingMethods.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001282-1001751-BCIJHEDH&gt; in the existing (sparse) naming guidelines.<br></p><p>However, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s that much less subtle than the -ing ending. It&#39;s a different cue but not one that&#39;s really any more or less noticeable. (Evidence: DaveA did not know it or infer it despite driving this effort, i.e. getting plenty of exposure to many different APIs.)<br></p><p>(The participle ending for nullary methods or properties may be a little more subtle, especially for non-English speakers..)<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; A counter example for -ing usage: if we have a streaming-type and `trimming` is actually the process for continually removing those characters from the stream. The likely implementation of this is going to be a mutating function that fires events, or maybe it&#39;s a promise-like API that wraps the event handling differently. The corollary is that `trim` would actually be the one that produces no side-effects as it would be able to give a snapshot of the current state of a trimmed stream.<br></p><p>I can&#39;t actually picture this API. &#39;trimming&#39; and &#39;trim&#39; don&#39;t seem to follow the naming conventions for the operations you&#39;ve described. Can you write it out?<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; Side note: the guidelines are also unintentionally narrow: &quot;Use the “ed/ing” rule to name the nonmutating counterpart of a mutating method.&quot;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; We should *always* be following this pattern regardless of the existence of a nonmutating counterpart. Otherwise, if you implement just a non-mutating function for sorting without the counterpart, you need to use a noun-phrase, like `sortBy`. Then if you later add a mutating version, you need to rename the `sortBy` to `sorted`. That seems like the wrong outcome of the guidelines.<br></p><p>This I definitely agree with. If you have a non-mutating member that returns the same type as the receiver, it should be named as if there could be an in-place version added later.<br></p><p>Jordan<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160224/98151c03/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/012bc4c5e7b0c2829fff88611143c108?s=50"></div><header><strong>API Guidelines Update</strong> from <string>David Owens II</string> &lt;david at owensd.io&gt;<p>February 24, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Feb 24, 2016, at 11:25 AM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; on Wed Feb 24 2016, David Owens II &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Feb 22, 2016, at 11:02 AM, Jordan Rose via swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; In case it&#39;s been lost in all the discussion, the -ing/-ed rule is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; essentially the rule Objective-C uses, minus the noun labels for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; return value and types and the word &quot;by&quot;.
