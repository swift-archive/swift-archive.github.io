The proposal is available here:<br></p><p>https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0040-attributecolons.md<br></p><p>Reviews are an important part of the Swift evolution process. All reviews should be sent to the swift-evolution mailing list at:<br>	https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>or, if you would like to keep your feedback private, directly to the review manager. When replying, please try to keep the proposal link at the top of the message:<br></p><p>What goes into a review?<br></p><p>The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review through constructive criticism and, eventually, determine the direction of Swift. When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br></p><p>	• What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>	• Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>	• Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>	• If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>	• How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>More information about the Swift evolution process is available at:<br></p><p>https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br></p><p>Thank you,<br></p><p>-Chris<br>Review Manager<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/attachments/20160302/c7dca345/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d4fb9162c777a5d6d0b1fb00893d709?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0040 Replacing Equal Signs with Colons For Attribute Arguments</strong> from <string>Haravikk</string> &lt;swift-evolution at haravikk.me&gt;<p>March  2, 2016 at 11:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On 2 Mar 2016, at 22:46, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	• What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>I’m in favour of this; it’s a simple change, but increases consistency between attributes and functions.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>While I’d say it’s a fairly minor change, the benefit to consistency is solid for what should be a simple change.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes.

The proposal is available here:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0040-attributecolons.md &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0040-attributecolons.md&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Reviews are an important part of the Swift evolution process. All reviews should be sent to the swift-evolution mailing list at:<br>&gt; 	https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; or, if you would like to keep your feedback private, directly to the review manager. When replying, please try to keep the proposal link at the top of the message:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What goes into a review?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review through constructive criticism and, eventually, determine the direction of Swift. When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	• What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt; 	• Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt; 	• Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt; 	• If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt; 	• How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thank you,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Chris<br>&gt; Review Manager<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160304/b57859cf/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
