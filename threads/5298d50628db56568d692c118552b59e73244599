Having said, that it does make sense to me but would be an enormous breaking change for Swift now.<br></p><p>I was against the private/fileprivate distinction when it was proposed, but now it’s done and I’ve applied it to my own code, I am fine with it. I did a global replace of fileprivate with private in one of my largest converted source files and experienced only one breakage. I think there is a use case for fileprivate, so I wouldn’t want to get rid of it but I think it’s rare enough that the ugliness of its name doesn’t bother me. <br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f5f87c6d6b2f41c3ac647171eb30e34?s=50"></div><header><strong>private &amp; fileprivate</strong> from <string>Jean-Daniel</string> &lt;dev at xenonium.com&gt;<p>October 15, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Le 13 oct. 2016 à 23:27, Ted F.A. van Gaalen &lt;tedvgiosdev at gmail.com&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Please do NOT drop the current distinction between *private* and *fileprivate*<br>&gt; as it is now in Swift 3<br>&gt; It is needed for correct OOP.  <br>&gt; <br></p><p>That argument don’t apply for a language where you can structure your code in extensions as in Swift.<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d8867167dba9b648c6d0746a67bbc721?s=50"></div><header><strong>private &amp; fileprivate</strong> from <string>Goffredo Marocchi</string> &lt;panajev at gmail.com&gt;<p>October 15, 2016 at 09:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>We will see how this will fare one way or the other in say 10-15 years.<br></p><p>Sent from my iPhone<br></p><p>&gt; On 15 Oct 2016, at 14:43, Jean-Daniel via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Le 13 oct. 2016 à 23:27, Ted F.A. van Gaalen &lt;tedvgiosdev at gmail.com&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Please do NOT drop the current distinction between *private* and *fileprivate*<br>&gt;&gt; as it is now in Swift 3<br>&gt;&gt; It is needed for correct OOP.  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; That argument don’t apply for a language where you can structure your code in extensions as in Swift.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b35b44357e4cca3a1de39ba1199c9ab5?s=50"></div><header><strong>private &amp; fileprivate</strong> from <string>ted van gaalen</string> &lt;tedvgiosdev at gmail.com&gt;<p>October 15, 2016 at 11:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>in 10-15 years compilers/interpreters are merged and update themselves as AI.<br>so we can tell in human language what an app should do :o)<br></p><p>@Jean: can you explain that about extensions in this context (oop) ?<br></p><p>TedvG<br></p><p><br>ted van gaalen<br></p><p>&gt; On 15 Oct 2016, at 21:44, Goffredo Marocchi &lt;panajev at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We will see how this will fare one way or the other in say 10-15 years.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Sent from my iPhone<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On 15 Oct 2016, at 14:43, Jean-Daniel via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Le 13 oct. 2016 à 23:27, Ted F.A. van Gaalen &lt;tedvgiosdev at gmail.com&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Please do NOT drop the current distinction between *private* and *fileprivate*<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; as it is now in Swift 3<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It is needed for correct OOP.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; That argument don’t apply for a language where you can structure your code in extensions as in Swift.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20161015/38c8781f/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
