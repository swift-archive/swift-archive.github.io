This<br>&gt;     proposal expands the protocol to cover most of the expected basic<br>&gt;     operations, and adds a second protocol, BinaryFloatingPoint, that provides a<br>&gt;     number of useful tools for generic programming with the most commonly used<br>&gt;     types.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; SVG ImageMotivation<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     Beside the high-level motivation provided by the introduction, the proposed<br>&gt;     prototype schema addresses a number of issues and requests that we&#39;ve<br>&gt;     received from programmers:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     * FloatingPoint should conform to Equatable, and Comparable<br>&gt;     * FloatingPoint should conform to FloatLiteralConvertible<br>&gt;     * Deprecate the % operator for floating-point types<br>&gt;     * Provide basic constants (analogues of C&#39;s DBL_MAX, etc.)<br>&gt;     * Make Float80 conform to FloatingPoint<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     It also puts FloatingPoint much more tightly in sync with the work that is<br>&gt;     being done on protocols for Integers, which will make it easier to provide a<br>&gt;     uniform interface for arithmetic scalar types.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; SVG ImageDetailed design<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     A new protocol, Arithmetic, is introduced that provides the most basic<br>&gt;     operations (add, subtract, multiply and divide) as well as Equatable and<br>&gt;     IntegerLiteralConvertible, and is conformed to by both integer and floating-<br>&gt;     point types.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     There has been some resistance to adding such a protocol, owing to<br>&gt;     differences in behavior between floating point and integer arithmetic. While<br>&gt;     these differences make it difficult to write correct generic code that<br>&gt;     operates on all &quot;arithmetic&quot; types, it is nonetheless convenient to provide<br>&gt;     a single protocol that guarantees the availability of these basic<br>&gt;     operations. It is intended that &quot;number-like&quot; types should provide these<br>&gt;     APIs.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     /// Arithmetic protocol declares methods backing binary arithmetic operators,<br>&gt; /// such as  `+`, `-` and `*`; and their mutating counterparts.  These methods<br>&gt; /// operate on arguments of the same type.<br>&gt; ///<br>&gt; /// Both mutating and non-mutating operations are declared in the protocol, but<br>&gt; /// only the mutating ones are required.  Should conforming type omit<br>&gt; /// non-mutating implementations, they will be provided by a protocol extension.<br>&gt; /// Implementation in that case will copy `self`, perform a mutating operation<br>&gt; /// on it and return the resulting value.<br>&gt; public protocol Arithmetic: Equatable, IntegerLiteralConvertible {<br>&gt;   /// Initialize to zero<br>&gt;   init()<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   /// The sum of `self` and `rhs`.<br>&gt;   //  Arithmetic provides a default implementation of this method in terms<br>&gt;   //  of the mutating `add` operation.<br>&gt;   @warn_unused_result<br>&gt;   func adding(rhs: Self) -&gt; Self<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   /// Adds `rhs` to `self`.<br>&gt;   mutating func add(rhs: Self)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   /// The result of subtracting `rhs` from `self`.<br>&gt;   //  Arithmetic provides a default implementation of this method in terms<br>&gt;   //  of the mutating `subtract` operation.<br>&gt;   @warn_unused_result<br>&gt;   func subtracting(rhs: Self) -&gt; Self<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   /// Subtracts `rhs` from `self`.<br>&gt;   mutating func subtract(rhs: Self)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   /// The product of `self` and `rhs`.<br>&gt;   //  Arithmetic provides a default implementation of this method in terms<br>&gt;   //  of the mutating `multiply` operation.<br>&gt;   @warn_unused_result<br>&gt;   func multiplied(by rhs: Self) -&gt; Self<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   /// Multiplies `self` by `rhs`.<br>&gt;   mutating func multiply(by rhs: Self)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   /// The quotient of `self` dividing by `rhs`.<br>&gt;   //  Arithmetic provides a default implementation of this method in terms<br>&gt;   //  of the mutating `divide` operation.<br>&gt;   @warn_unused_result<br>&gt;   func divided(by rhs: Self) -&gt; Self<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   /// Divides `self` by `rhs`.<br>&gt;   mutating func divide(by rhs: Self)<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; /// SignedArithmetic protocol will only be conformed to by signed numbers,<br>&gt; /// otherwise it would be possible to negate an unsigned value.<br>&gt; ///<br>&gt; /// The only method of this protocol has the default implementation in an<br>&gt; /// extension, that uses a parameterless initializer and subtraction.<br>&gt; public protocol SignedArithmetic : Arithmetic {<br>&gt;   func negate() -&gt; Self<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     The usual arithmetic operators are then defined in terms of the<br>&gt;     implementation hooks provided by Arithmetic and SignedArithmetic, so<br>&gt;     providing those operations are all that is necessary for a type to present a<br>&gt;     &quot;number-like&quot; interface.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     The FloatingPoint protocol is split into two parts; FloatingPoint and<br>&gt;     BinaryFloatingPoint, which conforms to FloatingPoint. If decimal types were<br>&gt;     added at some future point, they would conform to DecimalFloatingPoint.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     FloatingPoint is expanded to contain most of the IEEE 754 basic operations,<br>&gt;     as well as conformance to SignedArithmetic and Comparable.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     /// A floating-point type that provides most of the IEEE 754 basic (clause 5)<br>&gt; /// operations.

What does it *do*, given an arbitrary<br>element type conforming to Addable?  The answer needs to be a<br>description of the semantics that doesn&#39;t require me to effectively<br>execute the source of the function in my head.  How can I test that the<br>method does the right thing?  To answer these questions, you have to<br>attach some semantics to Addable so that it&#39;s more than a mere bag of<br>syntax.  For example, for the above to produce the usual semantics of<br>summing, the Element&#39;s init() method needs to produce the additive<br>identity element.<br></p><p>Choosing the granularity of protocols is something of an art.  Lots has<br>been written about generic programming&#39;s “requirement minimization<br>principle,” in which the more requirements you add, the less reusable<br>algorithms become.  Almost nothing has been written about the other side<br>of the coin, but...<br></p><p>After much googling I came up with a reference to one of Alexander<br>Stepanov and James Dehnert&#39;s early papers on generic programming (it<br>sometimes amazes me how many of the key insights can only be found in<br>that early work):<br></p><p>http://www.stepanovpapers.com/DeSt98.pdf<br></p><p>  We call the set of axioms satisfied by a data type and a set of<br>  operations on it a concept. Examples of concepts might be an integer<br>  data type with an addition operation satisfying the usual axioms; or a<br>  list of data objects with a first element, an iterator for traversing<br>  the list, and a test for identifying the end of the list. **The critical<br>  insight which produced generic programming is that highly reusable<br>  components must be programmed assuming a minimal collection of such<br>  concepts, and that the concepts used must match as wide a variety of<br>  concrete program structures as possible**. Thus, successful production<br>  of a generic component is not simply a matter of identifying the<br>  minimal requirements of an arbitrary type or algorithm – it requires<br>  identifying the common requirements of a broad collection of similar<br>  components.

The above actually suggests that summable and multiplicative instances for numbers might just be that: (singleton?) instances of Monoid with an associated type of Number (instead of protocols) so that they can be passed around more easily. <br>On the other hand we could borrow some ideas from Eiffel to solve the (semantic) diamond problem via renaming and choosing defaults. Like the early work about generics you found, Eiffel&#39;s solution sadly is ignored in most language designs (and interfaces thought of as a solution of the diamond problem... they are not).

(NOT a rhetorical question)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;ll try to help answer...<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Speaking only for myself, I want stuff broken up into many simpler<br>&gt;&gt; protocols (which `Arithmetic` and such conform to) because there are<br>&gt;&gt; many algorithms which only require small parts of the larger<br>&gt;&gt; protocol. What if I wanted to add a function that sums all the<br>&gt;&gt; elements in a collection?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; extension CollectionType where Generator.Element: Arithmetic {<br>&gt;&gt;    func sum() -&gt; Generator.Element {<br>&gt;&gt;        var s = Generator.Element()<br>&gt;&gt;        for e in self {<br>&gt;&gt;            s.add(e)<br>&gt;&gt;        }<br>&gt;&gt;        return s<br>&gt;&gt;    }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Yeah, it works, but if I want to get the sum of a collection of some custom type, I<br>&gt;&gt; have to implement *all* of `Arithmetic`, as opposed to just the two<br>&gt;&gt; parts of it (`init()` and `.add(:)`) that the algorithm actually<br>&gt;&gt; uses. It’d be both simpler for the users and *more to the point of the<br>&gt;&gt; function*, if it could be written like this:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; extension CollectionType where Generator.Element: Addable { // &quot;Addable&quot; instead of &quot;Arithmetic&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;    ... // No change here<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This method is undocumented.  What does it *do*, given an arbitrary<br>&gt; element type conforming to Addable?  The answer needs to be a<br>&gt; description of the semantics that doesn&#39;t require me to effectively<br>&gt; execute the source of the function in my head.  How can I test that the<br>&gt; method does the right thing?  To answer these questions, you have to<br>&gt; attach some semantics to Addable so that it&#39;s more than a mere bag of<br>&gt; syntax.  For example, for the above to produce the usual semantics of<br>&gt; summing, the Element&#39;s init() method needs to produce the additive<br>&gt; identity element.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Choosing the granularity of protocols is something of an art.  Lots has<br>&gt; been written about generic programming&#39;s “requirement minimization<br>&gt; principle,” in which the more requirements you add, the less reusable<br>&gt; algorithms become.  Almost nothing has been written about the other side<br>&gt; of the coin, but...<br>&gt; <br>&gt; After much googling I came up with a reference to one of Alexander<br>&gt; Stepanov and James Dehnert&#39;s early papers on generic programming (it<br>&gt; sometimes amazes me how many of the key insights can only be found in<br>&gt; that early work):<br>&gt; <br>&gt; http://www.stepanovpapers.com/DeSt98.pdf<br>&gt; <br>&gt;  We call the set of axioms satisfied by a data type and a set of<br>&gt;  operations on it a concept. Examples of concepts might be an integer<br>&gt;  data type with an addition operation satisfying the usual axioms; or a<br>&gt;  list of data objects with a first element, an iterator for traversing<br>&gt;  the list, and a test for identifying the end of the list. **The critical<br>&gt;  insight which produced generic programming is that highly reusable<br>&gt;  components must be programmed assuming a minimal collection of such<br>&gt;  concepts, and that the concepts used must match as wide a variety of<br>&gt;  concrete program structures as possible**. Thus, successful production<br>&gt;  of a generic component is not simply a matter of identifying the<br>&gt;  minimal requirements of an arbitrary type or algorithm – it requires<br>&gt;  identifying the common requirements of a broad collection of similar<br>&gt;  components. The final requirement is that we accomplish this without<br>&gt;  sacrificing performance relative to programming with concrete<br>&gt;  structures. A good generic library becomes a repository of highly<br>&gt;  efficient data structures and algorithms, based on a small number of<br>&gt;  broadly useful concepts, such that a library user can combine them and<br>&gt;  his own components in a wide variety of ways.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; (emphasis mine).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m adding anything by saying this, but one problem with<br>&gt; creating protocols that satisfy the absolute minimum requirements for a<br>&gt; particular algorithm is that you end up without any meaningful<br>&gt; abstractions.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; “*The* critical insight,” wow.
