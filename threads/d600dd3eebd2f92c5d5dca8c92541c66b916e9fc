One of our near-term goals for the Package Manager is to move to a library-based architecture to allow for IDE integration; you can read about this goal at https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/PackageManagerCommunityProposal.md#library-based-architecture. We are planning to add great support for the Package Manager to Xcode. As Xcode is not part of the open source release, we don&#39;t plan to pre-announce a timeline or specific details of that Xcode support until we&#39;re ready to provide a beta version of Xcode that has it. We understand that this support is very important to our developer community.<br></p><p>Thank you,<br></p><p>	- Rick<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9632e5b06576428d580e66ddb71b74e7?s=50"></div><header><strong>Xcode support for Swift Package Manager</strong> from <string>Nabeel Imtiaz</string> &lt;nimtiazm at gmail.com&gt;<p>December  4, 2015 at 10:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Got it.<br></p><p>Meanwhile, also supporting emacs/vim through something like ctags would be great.

You might be able to leverage SourceKit&#39;s APIs to get the necessary information, and then it would be a matter of integrating this support into the package manager to provide the relevant files.<br></p><p> - Daniel<br></p><p><br>&gt; On Dec 4, 2015, at 10:14 AM, Nabeel Imtiaz &lt;nimtiazm at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Got it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Meanwhile, also supporting emacs/vim through something like ctags would be great.
