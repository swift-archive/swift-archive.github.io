While &quot;for _ in foo&quot; and &quot;for foo&quot; would be equivalent, usually the underscore is used to indicate intent to avoid mistakes, which is why we wouldn&#39;t to be able to just use &quot;case&quot; on its own to represent match all, as it could be a case statement that the user didn&#39;t finish, the underscore in this case makes it clear that yes, what the user wants to do is ignore the element(s) themselves.<br></p><p>However, unlike the switch case, for omitting the underscore to represent a mistake you&#39;d have to:<br>Forget the underscore<br>Forget the &quot;in&quot; keyword<br>Use a variable that should have been shadowed but wasn&#39;t, resulting in a subtle error.<br>I specify number 3 because if you use a variable that doesn&#39;t exist it will produce an obvious error.
