So if making two overloads is the only way to ensure that, then that’s what it takes. But will the performance of the normal case really suffer if we only require a sorting algorithm to restore the array to an arbitrary permutation of the original array, in case of an error?<br></p><p>If the consensus is that the original order of the array should be restored, then the normal case would obviously suffer from it. But I think just making sure no elements are lost is way more important than ensuring that the order is preserved. After all, changing the order is what a sorting algorithm does, so the original order is probably not crucial. But if the elements might be lost, people might be encouraged to make a back-up of the array before sorting it, in case an error is thrown.<br></p><p>&gt; &gt; On Jun 8, 2016, at 7:52 AM, Brent Royal-Gordon&lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;wrote:<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there a widely used comparison function that throws?<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Any comparison function that examines external data related to the instance:<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; * Sorting filenames by the data in the corresponding files<br>&gt; &gt; * Instances backed by a database where actually loading the data could fail<br>&gt; &gt; * Etc.<br>&gt; Ok, instead of using rethrows, would it be a better overall design be to define two overloads, one that takes a throwing closure and one that doesn’t? This allows the throw-supporting implementation to be slower without punishing the normal case..<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Chris<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
