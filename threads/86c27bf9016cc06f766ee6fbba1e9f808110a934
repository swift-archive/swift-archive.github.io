However so much time elapses waiting for review or re-review that the patch becomes stale.  Authors bump infrequently to try not to be annoying, and I am sure reviewers grow weary as the bumps are a lot louder when there are 80 people doing it.<br></p><p>Examples I&#39;ve been following:<br></p><p>https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/629 &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/629&gt;<br>https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1176 &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1176&gt;<br>https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1479 &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1479&gt;<br>https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1891 &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1891&gt;<br>https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch/pull/61 &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch/pull/61&gt;<br>https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch/pull/62 &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch/pull/62&gt;<br>https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch/pull/64 &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch/pull/64&gt;<br></p><p>Speaking only for myself, dreading this outcome has prevented me from sending ~10 patches upstream in the last two months.  I can work around a bug from my code in five minutes; but to prosecute that fix upstream and into a snapshot takes 6 weeks, and it is just not worth the effort to me the vast majority of the time.  Only in cases where I absolutely must, and even then, the experience resolves me to do it locally next time.  Meanwhile, I wonder if some of the very bright reviewers I&#39;ve had the pleasure to work find pouring over a mountain of boring patches involving dark corners of platforms they don&#39;t personally use and problems they don&#39;t have to be a source of joy.<br></p><p>Now, perhaps this is all by design, and if so: Okay.  But if it isn&#39;t by design, I wonder if there is some small change we could make to increase everyone&#39;s happiness.<br></p><p>Respectfully,<br></p><p>Drew<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160414/86c2a934/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
