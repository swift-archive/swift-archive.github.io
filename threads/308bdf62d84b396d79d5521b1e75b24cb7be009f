When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	• What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	• Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	• Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	• If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	• How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Joe<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Review Manager<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160120/f8e004e5/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0022: Referencing the Objective-C selector of a method</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>January 20, 2016 at 07:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jan 20, 2016, at 3:48 PM, Douglas Gregor via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jan 19, 2016, at 4:52 PM, Douglas Gregor via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jan 19, 2016, at 4:40 PM, Jacob Bandes-Storch &lt;jtbandes at gmail.com &lt;mailto:jtbandes at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there a well-defined meaning for `#` ?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Not yet.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; What about #selector(x)?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Objective-C selector formation is a *very* narrow feature to consider stealing one of our few underused sigils.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Actually, this isn’t that much different from “#available”, in the sense that it’s a special, compiler-supported expression type for which we don’t want to necessarily steal a keyword.

Producing the selector is something that can&#39;t quite be modeled as a real initializer, so the type checker would have to perform heroics to disambiguate a selector literal reference from a proper initializer call. We recommend reconsidering alternative syntactic forms for referencing the selector. Potential options include:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; - A unique prefix identifier, such as `objc_selector(Type.method)`, as you had originally proposed, or<br>&gt; - Taking advantage of the fact that functions don&#39;t have members to ascribe special behavior to &#39;Type.method.objcSelector&#39;, or something like it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Joe<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jan 18, 2016, at 8:02 AM, Joe Groff via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The review of “Referencing the Objective-C selector of a method” begins now and runs through January 23, 2016.
