The<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; mere fact that a class allows subclassing doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; every member in it is designed to be subclassed. Consider<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; `UIViewController`: It&#39;s obviously designed to be subclassed, and some<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; methods in it (such as `loadView`) are intended to be overridden, but others<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (such as `loadViewIfNeeded`) are *not* intended to be overridden.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; And [if UIViewController were to be written in Swift] there&#39;d be a good<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; reason why `loadViewIfNeeded` and others of its ilk couldn&#39;t be final?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know UIKit internals, but I could imagine loadViewIfNeeded be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; overridden internally, if one knows the precise internal workings of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; UIViewController. That would require open, to allow overriding internally<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; but not externally.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I thought about this aspect a little more. I think it&#39;s fair to say that<br>&gt;&gt; we&#39;re breaking new ground for language design here. Classes limiting<br>&gt;&gt; inheritance to a certain set of subclasses are nothing new (I&#39;ve written &amp;<br>&gt;&gt; used classes doing this in C++, Java and C#), but no language that I know of<br>&gt;&gt; allows limiting overrides of a specific public member in such a way. I think<br>&gt;&gt; we need a convincing rationale for making this esoteric middle ground<br>&gt;&gt; between final and open members the new default.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The UIKit example above isn&#39;t convincing at all. It is already quite easy to<br>&gt;&gt; allow package-internal subclasses to configure the behavior of<br>&gt;&gt; loadViewIfNeeded without such a novel language feature. E.g., the UIKit team<br>&gt;&gt; can simply make loadViewIfNeeded call into a non-final but internal method:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; public open class UIViewController {<br>&gt;&gt; private var _view: UIView? = nil<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; public final func loadViewIfNeeded() {<br>&gt;&gt; internalLoadViewIfNeeded()<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; internal func internalLoadViewIfNeeded() { // overridable internally<br>&gt;&gt; if let view = _view { return }<br>&gt;&gt; loadView()<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; public open func loadView() {<br>&gt;&gt; // Load it from a nib or whatevs<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I see no drawback to this pattern; it is quite clear and simple. Therefore,<br>&gt;&gt; in the interest of keeping the language free of needless complexity, I<br>&gt;&gt; suggest we change the proposal to remove the implicit &quot;sealed&quot; level of<br>&gt;&gt; public member overridability, and support only &quot;open&quot; or &quot;final&quot; class<br>&gt;&gt; members.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; For members, &quot;open&quot; should mean the opposite of &quot;final&quot;, with no levels in<br>&gt;&gt; between. Member-level openness should be entirely independent of visibility;<br>&gt;&gt; so it should be possible to say &quot;internal open&quot; to mean an internally<br>&gt;&gt; overridable member that&#39;s not at all visible outside the module -- the same<br>&gt;&gt; as today&#39;s default.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; (Note that (on platforms with an Objective-C runtime) &quot;dynamic&quot; provides a<br>&gt;&gt; third level of flexibility for class members; I argue that it should imply<br>&gt;&gt; &quot;open&quot;. So in order of increasing flexibility, we&#39;d have &quot;final&quot;, &quot;open&quot; and<br>&gt;&gt; &quot;dynamic&quot; members. This seems easy enough to describe and understand.)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I also suggest that for now, we should make neither &quot;final&quot; nor &quot;open&quot; nor<br>&gt;&gt; &quot;dynamic&quot; the default for public members of open classes: we should rather<br>&gt;&gt; require class authors to explicity add one of these qualifiers to all public<br>&gt;&gt; member declarations. This way, we can defer the argument for choosing a<br>&gt;&gt; default to a later (additive) proposal, once we have some experience with<br>&gt;&gt; this setup. Non-public members can safely keep defaulting to &quot;internal<br>&gt;&gt; open&quot;, like they do today.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; --<br>&gt;&gt; Károly<br>&gt;&gt; @lorentey<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p><br>-- <br>Károly<br>@lorentey<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d02ed1b20fc3e0fa1592ce5982f24d2b?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review #2] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Leonardo Pessoa</string> &lt;me at lmpessoa.com&gt;<p>July 18, 2016 at 06:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On 18 July 2016 at 16:06, Károly Lőrentey &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; On 2016-07-18 16:15:10 +0000, Leonardo Pessoa via swift-evolution said:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I believe sealed by default applied to functions makes the behaviour<br>&gt;&gt; consistent with classes and allows for the same behaviour we wanted<br>&gt;&gt; with this proposal.
