So which one is it and how does this change affect closure parameters?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The core team’s intent is that one can add cosmetic labels to function types, but that those labels are not (cannot be) used at the call site, e.g.,<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	func foo(fn: (success: Bool) -&gt; Void) {<br>&gt;&gt; 	  fn(true) // note: no ‘success:’ argument label<br>&gt;&gt; 	}<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	func bar(something: Bool) { }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	foo(bar) // okay: labels not considered<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The proposal should be updated accordingly so it’s clear for future readers.

The core team made it very clear that the core changes in the compiler were made a long time ago and that the things were working different from what many (including me) thought.

Swift designers have opened a huge can of worms by making argument labels first-class features :) This moves the issues from the formal type domain to linguistic domain, and natural language is horribly messy.  After some considerations, I believe that the move to separate type and signature is the simplest and probably the most reasonable solution (even though it makes me a bit sad), but we need some additional mechanism for dealing with closure arguments as well. Basically, we need something like a signature type/literal/syntax that enforces function signature, no matter the ‚kind‘ of function (func, variable, closure arg etc.). <br></p><p>Dr. Taras Zakharko<br></p><p>taras.zakharko at uzh.ch<br>IT Officer/Software Development<br>---------------------------------------------<br>Department of Comparative Linguistics<br>University of Zurich <br>Plattenstrasse 54, CH-8032 Zurich<br></p><p><br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I wish the core team or the author of the proposal came to this thread and engaged again with the community. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I am quite sure that they are discussing this internally :) Also, its weekend, let people get some rest!<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On 09 Jul 2016, at 10:56, Goffredo Marocchi via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Sent from my iPhone<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On 9 Jul 2016, at 00:53, Jon Shier &lt;jon at jonshier.com &lt;mailto:jon at jonshier.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While I can see why removing the labels from the type system would be a good idea, I don’t see why calling the functions with labels would be actively prohibited.

In response to community feedback, the core team is accepting the proposal with a revision to allow “purely cosmetic” parameter labels in closure types for documentation (as outlined in the alternatives section).  The core team also wants to clarify that a call to a value of closure type would not allow use of any parameter labels, some interpretations thought that “arbitrary” parameter labels could be used.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you to Austin Zheng for driving this discussion forward!
