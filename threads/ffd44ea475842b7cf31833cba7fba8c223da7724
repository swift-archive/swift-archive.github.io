OTOH, generics need lots of boilerplate. If you can bind a generic parameter for a supporting type with one of your own associated types though, the compiler can generate the boilerplate for you.<br></p><p>- Karl<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20161025/4072c2c9/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
