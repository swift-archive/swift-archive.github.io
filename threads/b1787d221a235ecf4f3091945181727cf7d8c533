The following code has a subtle bug in Objective-C whereas it works nicely in Swift. (One could also argue that the bug is in the code that produced bogus x/y-values in the first place, but anyhow.)<br></p><p>if(x || y) {<br>   if(x == y) {<br>      print(&quot;x and y are both true&quot;)<br>   } else {<br>      print(&quot;only one of x and y is true&quot;)<br>   }<br>} else {<br>   print(&quot;x and y are both false&quot;)<br>}<br></p><p>Of the three print()-statements above, 2 are wrong in Objective-C, and only the last one is true. E.g. if x is YES and y is 2, Objective-C will print &quot;only one of x and y is true&quot;. That&#39;s at least counter-intuitive, and once you spend an hour tracking down a bug related to it you&#39;ll appreciate a real Bool type that can really only be true or false, and nothing else. (Sure, booleans should only be YES or NO in Objective-C, and IMHO the culprit are usually implicit (or even explicit!) conversions from int or char (or id) to BOOL.) The Bool-semantics of Swift are the same as Java&#39;s, so I think it makes sense to call the literals true and false also.<br></p><p>-Michael<br></p><p>&gt; Am 04.05.2016 um 21:51 schrieb Robert Widmann via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I am a soft no on this if only because it seems unnecessary to augment such well-defined and meaningful constants to match Objective-C [e.g. we’re subject to the same set of “why does Swift use YES and NO when it already has true and false” questions that exist if you search around for “YES NO Objective-C”].

Objective-C solved this by adding macro equivalents, admittedly with some attendant fuzziness because boolean implementation details allowed non 0/1 truth values. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Swift on the other hand has very firm ideas about true and false. Adding yes and no literal aliases would enhance code readability with little cost. There&#39;s minimal historic support among languages for yes/no but Swift is an Apple-y kind of language and yes/no is an Apple-y kindness to developers.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I performed a gmane search and did not find a previous thread on this subject.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- E<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/831ba6eb600af4a6587f263373921bb2?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Including yes/no in stdlib as aliases for true/false</strong> from <string>Tino Heth</string> &lt;2th at gmx.de&gt;<p>May  5, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>I have seen wrong usage of bool values in Objective-C many times, and although most of those weren&#39;t real problems, I&#39;d rather prefer to be forced to use a single pair of words for true/false.<br>If this single pair is true/false or yes/no (or even .yes/.no [enum]) isn&#39;t that important to me, so I&#39;m less opposed to change the names instead of introducing an alias.<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d8867167dba9b648c6d0746a67bbc721?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Including yes/no in stdlib as aliases for true/false</strong> from <string>Goffredo Marocchi</string> &lt;panajev at gmail.com&gt;<p>May  5, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>I think the descriptive/natural language aspect of Objective-C and Cocoa was and is a strength that should be kept in Swift too. <br>It may be perceived as a pragmatist attempt to simplify the language somewhat or make it appear friendlier, but it is not a bad thing in and of itself. <br></p><p>[[iOS messageWithData:ideas] broadcast]<br></p><p>&gt; On 5 May 2016, at 08:54, Tino Heth via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I have seen wrong usage of bool values in Objective-C many times, and although most of those weren&#39;t real problems, I&#39;d rather prefer to be forced to use a single pair of words for true/false.<br>&gt; If this single pair is true/false or yes/no (or even .yes/.no [enum]) isn&#39;t that important to me, so I&#39;m less opposed to change the names instead of introducing an alias.<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab8ff5d36ad4f40d7905509956e5c706?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Including yes/no in stdlib as aliases for true/false</strong> from <string>Jacopo Andrea Giola</string> &lt;swift-evolution at jacopo.giola.org&gt;<p>May  5, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>-1 for me as well.<br></p><p>One of the most FAQ of other fellow developers coming from other languages are often confuse by the YES/NO boolean in Obj-C and always asks why I use those and not true/false (and don’t get me started on nil/Nil/NULL).<br>I don’t want to find in the future discussion on StackOverflow with titles like “What are the differences between true/yes/on and false/no/off in Swift?” or “Is more correct to use yes or on in method x?”<br></p><p>Jacopo<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cce5c4aaa87dd6df9c22ede21d5d1ed6?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Including yes/no in stdlib as aliases for true/false</strong> from <string>Adrian Zubarev</string> &lt;adrian.zubarev at devandartist.com&gt;<p>May  5, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>-1 as well.
