It’s limiting that inference to a single conformance, but solving for all of the associated type witnesses simultaneously, using educated guesses as to which value witnesses will eventually be used (this is unchecked and seriously buggy). The fact that it’s only solving for a single conformance—e.g., “X : Collection” helps restrict the inference, but it’s also somewhat incorrect: why shouldn’t implementing a requirement from MutableCollection allow one to infer some associated type witness—say, the Index type—for a Collection? IIRC, we have some requirements duplicated in the standard library’s protocols simply to push the associated type inference into handling these cases.<br></p><p><br>&gt; My<br>&gt; suggestion is that we keep associated type inference for the simple<br>&gt; cases where it is obvious what the user meant.  The author of the<br>&gt; protocol would be able to identify these simple cases and define how<br>&gt; exactly the inference should happen.

If there is no @infers for a certain associated type, then<br>&gt; it is never inferred and should always be specified explicitly.<br></p><p>Pragmatically, this approach can reduce associated type inference and its associated problems. It might even provide a way for us to stage in the removal of type inference for associated types from the language, by removing it from the “user-facing” language but leaving it enabled in key standard library protocols so we don’t regress too badly, giving us more time to sort out how defaulted associated types and type aliases in protocol extensions can fill the gap.<br></p><p>However, this doesn’t actually achieve the simplification in the type checker that is intended. We would still need to maintain the existing global inference algorithm, and while it would (overall) reduce the number of requirements we need to consider when inferring associated type witnesses, it’s still a global problem because you can still have several possible “startIndex” or “iterator()” potential witnesses to consider (e.g., in the type, protocol extensions, constrained protocol extensions, and so on; and it gets more interesting with conditional conformances). And as soon as you mark that subscript with @infers(Index), all of the complexity becomes apparent again.<br></p><p>That brings me to the other point about this: it’s changing the default, but nothing would prevent a user from simply marking every requirement with @infers(each-associated-type-listed), in which case we’ve not actually fixed the problem. <br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; This is the basic idea, I&#39;m sure there are corner cases I haven&#39;t<br>&gt; thought about (e.g., how does this interact with constrained<br>&gt; extension, can we still solve everything with a simple algorithm?)<br>&gt; But the reason why I&#39;m suggesting this alternative is that I&#39;m<br>&gt; concerned that in simple cases like inferring the &#39;Index&#39; and<br>&gt; &#39;Iterator&#39; typealiases having to specify them manually is just<br>&gt; boilerplate, that does not add to clarity, and, I believe, can be<br>&gt; inferred by the type checker without involving a heavy constrain<br>&gt; solver.<br></p><p><br>The solver for associated type witnesses is not simple, despite my assertions in that amusing commit message. It’s just simpler than going through the (expression) constraint solver, which we had before. It has to track multiple solutions from different possible requirement/witness pairings, rank the results, etc. Nothing in this proposal simplifies any of that… it just tries to give that solver smaller problems to work with.<br></p><p>	- Doug<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0a5152b275c43b493a94b5a6a868905?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Remove type inference for associated types</strong> from <string>Pyry Jahkola</string> &lt;pyry.jahkola at iki.fi&gt;<p>June 25, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Hi Austin,<br></p><p>I also think it&#39;s better to make associated types explicit in protocol conformance.

I’m hoping the Doug or Chris (or someone else from the core team) can chime in on the feasibility of this alternative.  If it is considered viable and Dmitri isn’t able to write the proposal I would be happy to do so.<br></p><p>If the alternative isn’t viable and we must proceed with a proposal to remove inference I think there is one crucial thing to consider that isn’t discussed in this proposal: retroactive modeling.  As far as I can tell, this proposal will *prohibit* some types from conforming to some protocols.  Specifically, if a type defines a typealias with a name that matches the name of an associatedtype in a protocol it would not be possible to retroactively model that protocol.  Because of the name conflict an associatedtype declaration would not be allowed and the existing typealias would not meet the requirement.  Consider this example:<br></p><p>// Module A<br>public struct S {<br>    public typealias Foo = Int<br>}<br></p><p>// Module B<br>public protocol P {<br>    associatedtype Foo<br>}<br></p><p>// Module C<br>import A<br>import B<br></p><p>// compiler error: `S` does not meet the `Foo` associatedtype requirement<br>extension S : P {<br>    // compiler error: cannot define associatedtype `Foo` for `S` which already declares typealias `Foo`<br>    associatedtype Foo = String<br>}<br></p><p>I cannot support any proposal that breaks retroactive modeling in this way.<br></p><p>Another item that is not mentioned in this proposal is that typealias is not the only way to meet an associatedtype requirement in the language today.  For example, this code is legal:<br></p><p>protocol Foo {<br>    associatedtype Bar<br>}<br>struct S : Foo {<br>    struct Bar {}<br>}<br></p><p>If we *must* drop inference I prefer the alternative of just doing that: dropping inference, but otherwise leaving things alone.  All associated type requirements would need to be explicitly satisfied using one of the mechanisms that is currently valid for satisfying a non-inferred associated type requirement.  The ability to satisfy these requirements in a variety of ways is a *benefit* that provides valuable flexibility.<br></p><p>I agree that something should look for a good solution to the subclass typealias issue, but I don’t think this is it.  Ideally we would find a solution that works well in the presence of retroactive modeling making code such as the following valid:<br></p><p>// module A<br>protocol P1 {<br>    associatedtype Foo<br></p><p>   @infers(Foo)<br>    var foo: Foo { get }<br>}<br>// module B<br>protocol P2 {<br>    associatedtype Foo<br></p><p>    @infers(Foo)<br>    func bar() -&gt; Foo<br>}<br></p><p>// module C<br>class Base {<br>    let foo: String = &quot;foo&quot;<br>}<br>class Derived : Base {<br>    func bar() -&gt; Int { return 42 }<br>}<br></p><p>// module D<br>import A<br>import B<br>import C<br>import D<br>extension Base : P1 {}<br>extension Derived : P2 {}<br></p><p>We don’t always control the protocol or type definitions we want to make work together.  The ability to make code that “should work together” actually do so with minimal fuss is one of the great things about Swift.  Any time we interfere with retroactive modeling we increase the need for boilerplate adapter types, etc.<br></p><p>One detail appears to be implied by the proposal but isn’t explicitly stated.  Specifically, it looks like the intent is that other than only being valid when used to meet a protocol requirement, associatedtype otherwise works like a typealias.  It would be good to have this behavior clarified if the proposal moves forward.<br></p><p>-Matthew<br></p><p><br></p><p>&gt; On Jun 25, 2016, at 12:50 AM, Austin Zheng via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hello all,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Per Chris Lattner&#39;s list of open Swift 3 design topics (http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution/21369 &lt;http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution/21369&gt;), I&#39;ve put together a proposal for removing type inference for associated types.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It can be found here: https://github.com/austinzheng/swift-evolution/blob/az-assoctypeinf/proposals/XXXX-remove-assoctype-inference.md &lt;https://github.com/austinzheng/swift-evolution/blob/az-assoctypeinf/proposals/XXXX-remove-assoctype-inference.md&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thoughts, criticism, and feedback welcome.

Ideally we would find a solution that works well in the presence of retroactive modeling making code such as the following valid:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; // module A<br>&gt;&gt; protocol P1 {<br>&gt;&gt;     associatedtype Foo<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;    @infers(Foo)<br>&gt;&gt;     var foo: Foo { get }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; // module B<br>&gt;&gt; protocol P2 {<br>&gt;&gt;     associatedtype Foo<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;     @infers(Foo)<br>&gt;&gt;     func bar() -&gt; Foo<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; // module C<br>&gt;&gt; class Base {<br>&gt;&gt;     let foo: String = &quot;foo&quot;<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; class Derived : Base {<br>&gt;&gt;     func bar() -&gt; Int { return 42 }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; // module D<br>&gt;&gt; import A<br>&gt;&gt; import B<br>&gt;&gt; import C<br>&gt;&gt; import D<br>&gt;&gt; extension Base : P1 {}<br>&gt;&gt; extension Derived : P2 {}<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; We don’t always control the protocol or type definitions we want to make work together.  The ability to make code that “should work together” actually do so with minimal fuss is one of the great things about Swift.  Any time we interfere with retroactive modeling we increase the need for boilerplate adapter types, etc.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; One detail appears to be implied by the proposal but isn’t explicitly stated.  Specifically, it looks like the intent is that other than only being valid when used to meet a protocol requirement, associatedtype otherwise works like a typealias.  It would be good to have this behavior clarified if the proposal moves forward.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; -Matthew<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 25, 2016, at 12:50 AM, Austin Zheng via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello all,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Per Chris Lattner&#39;s list of open Swift 3 design topics (http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution/21369), I&#39;ve put together a proposal for removing type inference for associated types.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It can be found here: https://github.com/austinzheng/swift-evolution/blob/az-assoctypeinf/proposals/XXXX-remove-assoctype-inference.md<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Thoughts, criticism, and feedback welcome.

There are at least two slightly different designs in the proposal, and I&#39;m sure people will have ideas for even more.<br></p><p>Thanks for working on this. I have a couple of comments.<br></p><p>I don’t think we should be adding the ability to write ‘associatedtype’ declarations in classes/structs/enums. We already have the ability to explicitly state the associated type witness by declaring a typealias, struct, enum, or class with the appropriate name. Indeed, I feel like a lot of complexity of the proposal is linked to adding  ‘associatedtype’ declarations into the language, and I’d rather this proposal stay narrow.<br></p><p>I think it’s important for this proposal to show the other ways in which one can get associated type witnesses without writing them explicitly in the conforming type, even once inference goes away. For example, we have associated type defaults, e.g.,<br></p><p>	protocol P {<br>	  associatedtype Associated = Int<br>	}<br></p><p>	struct X : P {<br>	  // Associated becomes Int if not otherwise specified<br>	}<br></p><p>and with typealiases in protocol extensions becoming real and useful, one could also use protocol extensions:<br></p><p>	protocol P2 {<br>	  associatedtype Index<br>	}<br></p><p>	extension P2 {<br>	  typealias Index = Int<br>	}<br></p><p>which, of course, implies that one can use various tricks with constrained protocol extensions and such. There isn’t any proposed change here, but it illustrates that Swift programmers aren’t without recourse if type inference for associated types go away.<br></p><p>One concern with applying the above tricks is that existing code can change meaning when inference goes away. For example, let’s think about the “Iterator” type of a Sequence. It already uses default associated type witnesses (not associated type witness inference!) to give a default of IndexingIterator&lt;Self&gt;, e.g.,<br></p><p>	protocol Sequence {<br>	  associatedtype Iterator: IteratorType<br>	  func makeIterator() -&gt; Iterator<br>	}<br></p><p>	protocol Collection : Sequence {<br>	  associatedtype Iterator = IndexingIterator&lt;Self&gt;<br>	  func makeIterator() -&gt; Iterator  // redeclaration helps inference<br>	}<br></p><p>When a type that conforms to Collection doesn’t provide makeIterator, it gets a default one via:<br></p><p>	extension Collection where Iterator == IndexingIterator&lt;Self&gt; {<br>	  public func makeIterator() -&gt; IndexingIterator&lt;Self&gt; { … }<br>	}<br></p><p>That will still work (yay). However, simply removing associated type inference means that a collection type that *does* provide makeIterator()—but not, directly, Iterator—would change behavior:<br></p><p>	struct IntCollection : Collection {<br>	  typealias Element = Int<br>	  func makeIterator() -&gt; IntCollectionIterator { … }<br>	}<br></p><p>With associated type inference, we infer Iterator = IntCollectionIterator and select IntCollection.makeIterator() to satisfy the makeIterator() requirement.<br></p><p>Without associated type inference, we use the default Iterator = IndexingIterator&lt;Self&gt; and select the makeIterator() from the protocol extension (because IntCollection.makeIterator() now returns the wrong type), which turns an error of omission into an unpleasant surprise. We might need something like near-miss checking for defaulted protocol requirements (which we discussed in the thread at http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.devel/1799) to help find those surprises. They already exist today, of course, but removing associated type inference would make them worse.<br></p><p>Finally, one of the chief concerns is that we won’t be able to provide a nice experience when conforming to the standard library’s collection protocols.

For example, we have associated type defaults, e.g.,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	protocol P {<br>&gt; 	  associatedtype Associated = Int<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	struct X : P {<br>&gt; 	  // Associated becomes Int if not otherwise specified<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; and with typealiases in protocol extensions becoming real and useful, one could also use protocol extensions:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	protocol P2 {<br>&gt; 	  associatedtype Index<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	extension P2 {<br>&gt; 	  typealias Index = Int<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; which, of course, implies that one can use various tricks with constrained protocol extensions and such. There isn’t any proposed change here, but it illustrates that Swift programmers aren’t without recourse if type inference for associated types go away.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; One concern with applying the above tricks is that existing code can change meaning when inference goes away. For example, let’s think about the “Iterator” type of a Sequence. It already uses default associated type witnesses (not associated type witness inference!) to give a default of IndexingIterator&lt;Self&gt;, e.g.,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	protocol Sequence {<br>&gt; 	  associatedtype Iterator: IteratorType<br>&gt; 	  func makeIterator() -&gt; Iterator<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	protocol Collection : Sequence {<br>&gt; 	  associatedtype Iterator = IndexingIterator&lt;Self&gt;<br>&gt; 	  func makeIterator() -&gt; Iterator  // redeclaration helps inference<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; When a type that conforms to Collection doesn’t provide makeIterator, it gets a default one via:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	extension Collection where Iterator == IndexingIterator&lt;Self&gt; {<br>&gt; 	  public func makeIterator() -&gt; IndexingIterator&lt;Self&gt; { … }<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That will still work (yay). However, simply removing associated type inference means that a collection type that *does* provide makeIterator()—but not, directly, Iterator—would change behavior:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	struct IntCollection : Collection {<br>&gt; 	  typealias Element = Int<br>&gt; 	  func makeIterator() -&gt; IntCollectionIterator { … }<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; <br>&gt; With associated type inference, we infer Iterator = IntCollectionIterator and select IntCollection.makeIterator() to satisfy the makeIterator() requirement.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Without associated type inference, we use the default Iterator = IndexingIterator&lt;Self&gt; and select the makeIterator() from the protocol extension (because IntCollection.makeIterator() now returns the wrong type), which turns an error of omission into an unpleasant surprise. We might need something like near-miss checking for defaulted protocol requirements (which we discussed in the thread at http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.devel/1799 &lt;http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.devel/1799&gt;) to help find those surprises.

There isn’t any proposed change here, but it illustrates that Swift programmers aren’t without recourse if type inference for associated types go away.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; One concern with applying the above tricks is that existing code can change meaning when inference goes away. For example, let’s think about the “Iterator” type of a Sequence. It already uses default associated type witnesses (not associated type witness inference!) to give a default of IndexingIterator&lt;Self&gt;, e.g.,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    protocol Sequence {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;      associatedtype Iterator: IteratorType<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;      func makeIterator() -&gt; Iterator<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    protocol Collection : Sequence {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;      associatedtype Iterator = IndexingIterator&lt;Self&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;      func makeIterator() -&gt; Iterator  // redeclaration helps inference<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; When a type that conforms to Collection doesn’t provide makeIterator, it gets a default one via:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    extension Collection where Iterator == IndexingIterator&lt;Self&gt; {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;      public func makeIterator() -&gt; IndexingIterator&lt;Self&gt; { … }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; That will still work (yay). However, simply removing associated type inference means that a collection type that *does* provide makeIterator()—but not, directly, Iterator—would change behavior:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    struct IntCollection : Collection {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;      typealias Element = Int<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;      func makeIterator() -&gt; IntCollectionIterator { … }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;    }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; With associated type inference, we infer Iterator = IntCollectionIterator and select IntCollection.makeIterator() to satisfy the makeIterator() requirement.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Without associated type inference, we use the default Iterator = IndexingIterator&lt;Self&gt; and select the makeIterator() from the protocol extension (because IntCollection.makeIterator() now returns the wrong type), which turns an error of omission into an unpleasant surprise. We might need something like near-miss checking for defaulted protocol requirements (which we discussed in the thread at http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.devel/1799) to help find those surprises.

What are the surprises?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   - Doug<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt; <br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160629/61937cb7/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Remove type inference for associated types</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>June 30, 2016 at 05:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jun 29, 2016, at 6:55 AM, Brandon Knope via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What&#39;s the rationale for having associatedtype in protocols and typealias in the conforming types?<br></p><p>I didn&#39;t design it, but here&#39;s how I think about it: The associated type requirement merely states that there must be a type with this name meeting these criteria. `typealias` is one way to satisfy that requirement, but you can also just define a nested type with that name:<br></p><p>	struct MyCollection {<br>		struct Index: Comparable { … }<br>	}<br></p><p>Should you replace `struct` with `associatedtype`?
