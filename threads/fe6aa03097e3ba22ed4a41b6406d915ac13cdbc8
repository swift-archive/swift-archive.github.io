I&#39;ll add that, in our original grand vision for compiler flags before the reality of shipping got in the way, it would have been possible to use flags both to conditionalize compilation, similar to #if in C-family languages, but also as expressions, for conditionalization during code generation, which would allow for either:<br></p><p>#if config(Debug)<br>func debugTrap() { fatalError() }<br>#else<br>func debugTrap() { /*do nothing*/ }<br>#endif<br></p><p>or:<br></p><p>func assert(...) {<br>  if #config(Debug) {<br>    fatalError()<br>  }<br>}<br></p><p>and we would have encouraged the latter where possible, since it would allow for more sharing of build products across build configurations. #if-style conditionalization is unavoidable if you need to conditionally import frameworks that are only available on specific platforms, but the &#39;if #&#39; approach allows for more efficient cross-platform, cross-configuration builds and lets the compiler more eagerly check semantics without fully depending on execution tests on every target platform.<br></p><p>-Joe<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160220/a04df90d/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd033b3ed46d65c7d7394eab52d53e6b?s=50"></div><header><strong>Idea: Support #if os(Darwin) as shorthand for os(iOS) || os(OSX) || os(watchOS) || os(tvOS)</strong> from <string>Evan Maloney</string> &lt;emaloney at gilt.com&gt;<p>February 22, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt;&gt; SwiftPM passes DEBUG and NDEBUG.

In production code, we set up CleanroomLogger to log asynchronously, which is another way to optimize performance.<br></p><p>Currently, the concept of debug mode only lives at the application level, and we pass the -DDEBUG flag to indicate a debug build. Since the compiler knows whether we&#39;re building for debug or not, it would be great to not have to pass this in.<br></p><p>I can understand this would be tricky for binary-only frameworks, but in our case, everything we touch is open-source; we integrate as git submodules with embedded Xcode projects &amp; compile everything ourselves. I suspect this is pretty common with pure-Swift projects. Since there isn&#39;t ABI compatibility yet, people probably aren&#39;t releasing binary-only packages with Swift.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160222/75146694/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/06c1dcc7dce6a93d194b9c013376e3f0?s=50"></div><header><strong>Idea: Support #if os(Darwin) as shorthand for os(iOS) || os(OSX) || os(watchOS) || os(tvOS)</strong> from <string>Joe Groff</string> &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt;<p>February 19, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Feb 19, 2016, at 11:53 AM, Jordan Rose via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I agree that we need something here, but I really like the property we have today that all of the &quot;os&quot; options are mutually exclusive.
