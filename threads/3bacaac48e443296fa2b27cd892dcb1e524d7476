For<br>&gt; instance, the visual glyph 🇺🇸 is the the result of putting side-by-side<br>&gt; the Unicode characters 🇺 and  🇸(&quot;REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER U&quot; and<br>&gt; &quot;REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER S&quot;), which are themselves encoded as<br>&gt; UTF-8 using 4 bytes each. A design in which you can &quot;just write&quot;<br>&gt; string[4544] hides the fact that indexing is a linear-time operation that<br>&gt; needs to recompose UTF-8 characters and then recompose visual glyphs on top<br>&gt; of that.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Generally speaking, I *think* that I agree that human-geared &quot;long<br>&gt; string&quot; on which you probably won&#39;t need random access, and machine-geared<br>&gt; smaller strings that encode a command, could benefit from not being<br>&gt; considered the same fundamental thing. However, I&#39;m also afraid that this<br>&gt; will end with more applications and websites that think that first names<br>&gt; only contain 7-bit-clean characters in the A-Z range. (I live in the US and<br>&gt; I can attest that this is still very common.)<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; You could make a point too that better facilities to parse strings<br>&gt; would probably address this issue.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Félix<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Le 15 août 2016 à 10:52:02, Kenny Leung via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree with both points of view.

This seems reasonable to me for most character sets like<br>&gt; Roman, Cyrillic, Chinese. There is some doubt in my mind for things like<br>&gt; subscripted Japanese or connected (ligatured?) languages like Arabic, Hindi<br>&gt; or Thai.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Kenny<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 15, 2016, at 10:42 AM, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Sun, Aug 14, 2016 at 5:41 PM, Michael Savich via<br>&gt; swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Back in Swift 1.0, subscripting a String was easy, you could just<br>&gt; use subscripting in a very Python like way. But now, things are a bit more<br>&gt; complicated. I recognize why we need syntax like<br>&gt; str.startIndex.advancedBy(x) but it has its downsides. Namely, it makes<br>&gt; things hard on beginners. If one of Swift&#39;s goals is to make it a great<br>&gt; first language, this syntax fights that. Imagine having to explain Unicode<br>&gt; and character size to an 8 year old. This is doubly problematic because<br>&gt; String manipulation is one of the first things new coders might want to do.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What about having an InternalString subclass that only supports<br>&gt; one encoding, allowing it to be subscripted with Ints? The idea is that an<br>&gt; InternalString is for Strings that are more or less hard coded into the<br>&gt; app. Dictionary keys, enum raw values, that kind of stuff. This also has<br>&gt; the added benefit of forcing the programmer to think about what the String<br>&gt; is being used for. Is it user facing? Or is it just for internal use? And<br>&gt; of course, it makes code dealing with String manipulation much more concise<br>&gt; and readable.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It follows that something like this would need to be entered as a<br>&gt; literal to make it as easy as using String. One way would be to make all<br>&gt; String literals InternalStrings, but that sounds far too drastic. Maybe<br>&gt; appending an exclamation point like &quot;this&quot;! Or even just wrapping the whole<br>&gt; thing in exclamation marks like !&quot;this&quot;! Of course, we could go old school<br>&gt; and write it like @&quot;this&quot; …That last one is a joke.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll be the first to admit I&#39;m way in over my head here, so I&#39;m<br>&gt; very open to suggestions and criticism. Thanks!<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I can sympathize, but this is tricky.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fundamentally, if it&#39;s going to be a learning and teaching issue,<br>&gt; then this &quot;easy&quot; string should be the default. That is to say, if I write<br>&gt; `var a = &quot;Hello, world!&quot;`, then `a` should be inferred to be of type<br>&gt; InternalString or EasyString, whatever you want to call it.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But, we also want Swift to support Unicode by default, and we want<br>&gt; that support to do things The Right Way(TM) by default.

Why can’t I do this? Am I stupid? Is the Swift team purposely trying to make this hard for me?”<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I’ve been reading swift-evolution for a long time now, and a reason often given for design decisions is “term of art”. I believe that integer-based subscriptablilty is a term of art that should be supported.<br>&gt; &lt;heart-to-heart off&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Aug 17, 2016, at 12:51 PM, Shawn Erickson &lt;shawnce at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I would also like to understand the perceived problem for first time programmers.
