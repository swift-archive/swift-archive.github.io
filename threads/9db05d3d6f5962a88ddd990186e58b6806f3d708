As stated during one of the previous threads on the naming<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; of map, flatMap, filter, etc. methods on Sequence, Sequence has a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; naming requirement not typical of the rest of the Swift standard<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; library in that many methods on Sequence may or may not be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; destructive. As such, naming methods for any extensions on Sequence is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; challenging as the names need to not imply immutability.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think the names are really the worst potential cause of<br>&gt;&gt; confusion here.

You currently have<br>&gt; to over-constrain types to `Collection` even if you don’t need to do<br>&gt; anything other than iterate the elements (the discussion about whether<br>&gt; `LazyFilterSequnce` has a bug in its `underestimateCount` is relevant<br>&gt; here).<br></p><p>That&#39;s not an over-constraint.  Multi-pass-ness *is* the fundamental<br>distinction between Sequence and Collection.

Making it clear where multipass is valid and making a distinction between finite and infinite sequences will simplify things IMO.  Figuring out the best way to organize them is the tricky part.  I think Brent is heading in the right direction in his post.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The most obvious simplification would be to drop `Iterable` if we<br>&gt;&gt; don’t have any compelling use cases for infinite, single pass<br>&gt;&gt; sequences.  One downside to doing this is that the syntactic<br>&gt;&gt; requirements would need to be repeated in both `FiniteIterable` and<br>&gt;&gt; `MultipassIterable`<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Another obvious simplification would be to also remove `Sequence`<br>&gt;&gt; (which becomes a “convenience” protocol under this model) and require<br>&gt;&gt; types that can conform to both `FiniteIterable` and<br>&gt;&gt; `MultipassIterable` to do so directly.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; If chose to make both simplifications we could also rename the<br>&gt;&gt; remaining `FiniteIterable` and `MultipassIterable` to something<br>&gt;&gt; simpler like `Iterable` and `Sequence`.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;               (for..in)              (the existing `Sequence` with an additional multipass semantic requirement) <br>&gt;&gt;               Iterable             Sequence  <br>&gt;&gt;                        \                 /<br>&gt;&gt;                          \              / <br>&gt;&gt;                           \            /<br>&gt;&gt;                          Collection<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I’m interested in hearing what others think about this way of thinking about the available design space.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; -Matthew<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -- <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Dave<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Dave<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160622/fb9cb75e/attachment-0001.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9bfba345bd373f7b8874d58fed6372ff?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Remove destructive consumption from Sequence</strong> from <string>David Waite</string> &lt;david at alkaline-solutions.com&gt;<p>June 22, 2016 at 11:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jun 22, 2016, at 7:12 PM, Matthew Johnson via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jun 22, 2016, at 6:41 PM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; on Wed Jun 22 2016, Matthew Johnson &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 22, 2016, at 3:57 PM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe this is a problem that should be solved.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I also believe distinguishing between finite and infinite sequences is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; a good idea (along with preventing for..in from being used with an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; infinite sequence)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; for..in over an infinite sequence is not necessarily wrong.
