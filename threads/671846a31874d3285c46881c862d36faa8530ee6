Within a module we can use folders to physically group the files, but this is not mandatory (and xcode does not by default align the logical and physical structure of a project).

Gamma), but not entirely suited for the more fine-grained scenario that people keep use in the mail thread.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This led to my proposal to ALSO support (not REPLACE) <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; module A ===<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extension String {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func oneA() {  }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func twoA() {  }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func threeA() {  }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // more like the GO syntax<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; public static func indexOfSubStringInReversedOrder(self:String)(pattern:String) -&gt; Int {}    <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; module B ===<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extension String {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func oneB() {  }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func twoB() {  }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func threeB() {  }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // more like the c#/XText/XTend/... syntax<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; public static func indexOfSubStringInReversedOrder(self:String, pattern:String) -&gt; Int {}    <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because we can now do the following without altering anything<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; import func moduleA.indexOfSubStringInReversedOrder<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; var idx = &quot;blahblahXYZblah&quot;.indexOfSubStringInReversedOrder(&quot;zyx&quot;)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; What hinders me in the case of Swift’s extensions to write<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; import func moduleA.String.oneB<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This would achieve just the same thing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; hmmm….. I know… tempting, right?!    but how then does this not DESTROY the other behavior?!  “compiler, be smart… if I say nothing, then let the runtime loader import everything everywhere because it is still very useful even if I don’t want to recognize it right now. But then if I start to import something, then tell the runtime loader that he has to stop mocking about with all these extension blocks to String that he will find and just add the one method that I care about. and btw, remember to the other thing in all my other source files” I look forward to read the source code that will make it work, because I know I do not have the beginning of the imagination required to have a clue how it will look like.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m really not sure what you&#39;re talking about. Extension methods are resolved at compile-time, not run-time. (Except @objc extension methods, which are as dangerous as categories ever were, and which isn&#39;t changing.)<br>&gt; <br></p><p>this is wonderful news… all this time I was under the impression that <br></p><p>module MyApp {<br>source1.swift<br>import moduleA<br>var str = “sdfa”.extensionMethod()<br></p><p>source2.swift<br>import moduleB<br>var str = “sdfa”.extensionMethod()<br>}<br></p><p>was a problem… but it is not, because under the hood the definition of String changes depending on which source file I am looking at. The problem only occurs when both modules are imported in the same source file. I guess I never ran into it because I only use extensions as adapters.<br></p><p>thx.<br></p><p><br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160609/745be61e/attachment-0001.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>Name disambiguation of computed property/function with same type defined in extensions</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>June  7, 2016 at 04:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; I want to discuss the problem of name ambiguity when a computed property or function is defined with the same name and type in different modules.

I was under the impression so far that the point of extensions was that they are not tied to a source. This brings us back full circle to the very definition of extensions... However you slice it, swift is lacking some scoping bellow modules, and/or arround some of the language features.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IIRC, a member of the core team (Joe Groff, maybe?) indicated several months ago on the list that methods are internally namespaced to their module. Alas, I can’t find that message. It was a long time ago.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, here it is: https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20151207/000928.html &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20151207/000928.html&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Joe Groff wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “It&#39;s helpful to think of method names as being namespaced in Swift, by both their enclosing module and type. If two modules independently extend a protocol with a method of the same name, you still semantically have two distinct methods that dispatch independently. The extension would have to be factored into a common module both modules see for them to interact.”<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IOW, yes, Swift internally does something very much like &quot;hello world”.ModuleA::capitalized().<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can see this in the fact that two different files can see two different extension methods:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A.swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     import ModuleA<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     …<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     &quot;hello world&quot;.capitalized()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; B.swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     import ModuleB<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     …<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     &quot;hello world&quot;.capitalized()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; …even if they end up compiled into the same binary. And that makes sense: A.swift only expected to see ModuleA’s extension, and was presumably coded around that expectation. That ModuleB happened to end up mixed into the same binary shouldn’t change the behavior of A.swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If my understand is correct, then my &quot;hello world”.ModuleA::capitalized() and your &quot;hello world&quot;.(capitalized from ModuleA)() are both just syntax to expose something that Swift already tracks internally.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers, P<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160608/374c4e20/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4fe988326eed161b989d0c5521cb105?s=50"></div><header><strong>Name disambiguation of computed property/function with same type defined in extensions</strong> from <string>Jordan Rose</string> &lt;jordan_rose at apple.com&gt;<p>June  8, 2016 at 06:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jun 8, 2016, at 12:02, Thorsten Seitz via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Am 07.06.2016 um 22:27 schrieb L Mihalkovic &lt;laurent.mihalkovic at gmail.com &lt;mailto:laurent.mihalkovic at gmail.com&gt;&gt;:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 7, 2016, at 9:47 PM, Thorsten Seitz &lt;tseitz42 at icloud.com &lt;mailto:tseitz42 at icloud.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Am 07.06.2016 um 20:11 schrieb L Mihalkovic via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt;:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; T1 =======<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; import Lib1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; var str = func2()	// lib1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; T2 =======<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; import Lib1<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; import func Lib2.func2<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; var str = func2()	// lib2<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Shouldn&#39;t func2() be ambiguous here?
