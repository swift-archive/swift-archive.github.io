As expected, this proposal was extremely polarizing, with valid arguments on both sides.  The opinions held by supporters and opposers are held very strongly, and hundreds of emails were generated in a healthy debate about this topic.<br></p><p>The review manager read every post on this topic, and the core team discussed this topic at length.  The core team concluded three things: <br></p><p> - First, the core team *agrees with conviction* that it is the right default for public classes to be non-subclassable outside their module, unless they carry some additional indication from the API author that the class was designed to be subclassed.<br> - Second, there was insufficient discussion about anything *other* than the first point.  The proposal also contains the “overridable” concept, which is highly impactful, but lacked significant discussion.<br> - Third, the core team agrees that the concrete syntax of “subclassable class” is … suboptimal.<br></p><p>On the first point, there are three related arguments against SE-0117:<br></p><p>- First is that clients of Apple frameworks often choose to subclass classes that Apple publicly documents as being “not for subclassing”, as a way of “getting their job done,” typically as a way to work around claimed bugs in Apple frameworks.  The core team and others at Apple feel that this argument is analogous to the argument that Swift should “support method swizzling by default”.  Swift loves dynamic features, but has already taken a stance against unanticipated method swizzling, by requiring an API author to indicate where they allow method swizzling with the ‘dynamic’ keyword.  Almost all classes vended by Apple APIs are subclassable (which isn’t changed by this proposal) so this argument is not compelling to the core team, nor is it consistent with the existing design of Swift.  It is also important to note that Cocoa also makes heavy use of delegation (via protocols) which allows client code to customize framework behavior without subclassing.<br></p><p>- Second is that clients of some other public API vended by a non-Apple framework (e.g. a SwiftPM package) may end up in a situation where the framework author didn’t consider subclass-ability, but the client desires it.  In this situation, the core team feels that a bigger problem happened: the vendor of the framework did not completely consider the use cases of the framework.  This might have happened due to the framework not using sufficient black box unit testing, a failure of the imagination of the designer in terms of use cases, or because they have a bug in their framework that needs unanticipated subclass-ability in order to “get a job done”.  Similar to the first point, the core team feels that the language is not the right place to solve this problem.  Instead, there is a simple and general solution: communicate with the framework author and get them to add the capabilities that you desire.  If they simply need to add subclass-ability, then that is no problem: it is a source-compatible change to a dependency.<br></p><p>- Third is a longer-term meta-concern, wherein a few people are concerned that future pure-Swift APIs will not consider subclass-ability in their design and will accidentally choose-by-omission to prevent subclass-ability on a future pure-Swift API (vended by Apple or otherwise).  The core team feels that this is an extremely unlikely situation for several reasons.  First of which is that it heavily overlaps the first two concerns.  More significantly, any newly-designed and from-scratch APIs that are intended for Swift-only clients will make use of a breadth of abstractions supported by Swift—structs, enums, protocols, classes.  The primary reasons to use classes in Swift are subclassability and reference semantics, so the core team feels that the likelihood of accidental omission is small.  Likewise, the decision to require every member of a public class to be marked public in Swift indicates a commitment (in line with SE-0117) that expects cross-module API authors to think carefully about the API they are authoring as well as their use cases.<br></p><p>To reiterate, as a summary, the core team *agrees with conviction* that it is the right default for public classes to be non-subclassable outside their module, unless they carry some additional indication by the API author that the class was designed to be subclassed.  However, it does not yet have an opinion as to what that concrete syntax is.<br></p><p>------8&lt;-------<br></p><p>To sum this all up, the core team is rejecting this proposal and requesting a revision to change the concrete syntax to “public open class Foo” instead of “subclassable class Foo&quot;.  This approach satisfies the *unwavering* goal of requiring additional thought when publishing a class as public API, makes subclass-ability orthogonal to access control, and (admittedly as a bit of a swift-evolution process hack) asks the community for an in-depth discussion of the secondary points of the proposal: does it make sense to require every member to be marked as “overridable” in order to be overridden by an open subclass outside of the current module?<br></p><p>The core team appreciates that this is a situation where it is impossible to please everyone, while also recognizing that the challenges faced by developers of pure-Swift code are not exactly analogous to those faced by Objective-C developers.  Thank you to the many and diverse opinions and perspectives that have come in as part of this review cycle!<br></p><p> -Chris<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/attachments/20160714/cf4e1bf6/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecdb231117dda838340bfcbb8873d28e?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Returned for revision] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Paul Cantrell</string> &lt;cantrell at pobox.com&gt;<p>July 14, 2016 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jul 14, 2016, at 4:39 PM, Chris Lattner &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; To sum this all up, the core team is … requesting a revision to change the concrete syntax to “public open class Foo” instead of “subclassable class Foo”.<br></p><p>Yes, +1 to “public open Foo” instead of “subclassable Foo”.<br></p><p>Presumably “open” without “public” is an error…?<br></p><p>&gt; [The core team] asks the community for an in-depth discussion of the secondary points of the proposal: does it make sense to require every member to be marked as “overridable” in order to be overridden by an open subclass outside of the current module?<br></p><p>Tentative +1 to this, though I’m open to hearing arguments otherwise.<br></p><p>One could make a good case for overridable being the sensible default and require an explicit “final,” just as for internal subclassing. I lean against this for two reasons:<br></p><p>Explicit “overridable” is consistent with the general principle of explicit exposure of public promises in public APIs.<br>When a class is declared public, its members are still internal by default. By analogy, class-level “open” shouldn’t make members overridable by default either. With a language like Swift that encourages developers to lean on the compiler for verification, setting consistent expectations is crucial, and this behavior seems more consistent to me.<br></p><p>I look at this proposal primarily from the point of view of a library author who is trying to design their API right, and is looking for assistance from the language in achieving that goal. The core team’s proposals seem consistent with this.<br></p><p>This makes me wonder whether we should remove member-level “final” from the language, and require “overridable” (i.e. final methods by default) even for members of non-open classes just for consistency and simplicity.

All of this means that while the experiences using Objective-C frameworks can and should inform this discussion, but it does not translate “directly&quot; to Swift.<br></p><p>-Chris<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e4cf8c436da98736ad247681dc6c89a0?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Returned for revision] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Mike Sanderson</string> &lt;m at mikesand.com&gt;<p>July 16, 2016 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Fri, Jul 15, 2016 at 2:26 AM, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;<br>&gt; On Jul 14, 2016, at 10:58 PM, Charles Srstka &lt;cocoadev at charlessoft.com&gt;<br>&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Jul 14, 2016, at 4:39 PM, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - Second is that clients of some other public API vended by a non-Apple<br>&gt; framework (e.g. a SwiftPM package) may end up in a situation where the<br>&gt; framework author didn’t consider subclass-ability, but the client desires<br>&gt; it.

In all honesty, I have barely used ‚traditional’ OOP paradigms in the last few years at all. While OOP is a useful tool and its great for modelling certain relationship and problems, I agree with the sentiment expressed by the core team that ‚open by default‘ OOP introduces a great deal of complexity for the framework creator, framework client and the compiler alike. Objective-C, with its dynamic message dispatch is a great example of a feature that is very flexible and quite beautiful, but at the same time so inherently unsafe, that it can easily be abused - AND that has been abused extensively. <br></p><p>The fact is, the programming languages we are using currently don’t do a very good job in declaring, describing and enforcing invariants/contracts. More often than not, the invariants are expressed informally (if they are expressed at all). Under such circumstances, more openness means more chance to break things long-term. Until a more general solution can be found (API access roles? state invariants declarations?) anything that makes things more explicit is a good thing in my book. <br></p><p><br>&gt; On 15 Jul 2016, at 07:58, Charles Srstka via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Or because the framework was developed in the real world, rather than Elysium, and real-world framework developers just about *never* anticipate every single way someone might use their framework (Indeed, if developers were capable of such a thing, there would be no need for third-party software in the first place).<br></p><p>If I am selling a frying pen, I am really not interested in people using it as a hammer ;) To be honest, I don’t really understand your post.

If<br>&gt; you&#39;re opening up a class for subclassing, my gut says you should allow the<br>&gt; client to do as they wish.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If you have a class that was not open yet, just making it open wouldn&#39;t<br>&gt; expose any members: it would then just be subclassable.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If the act of making the class open doesn&#39;t implicitly make overriding<br>&gt; possible, well all you can do then is add methods, and that can be done<br>&gt; with extensions anyways, so it&#39;s not as useful and makes the *public open<br>&gt; class {}* pattern *just* by itself not so useful imho... 😬<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Also, the keyword &#39;open&#39; itself may imply &#39;hey I&#39;m open, please do what<br>&gt; you want with my public members&#39;, whereas &#39;subclassable&#39; is more specific<br>&gt; in intention...  (but that&#39;s just me, so n=1 and all that)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; TLDR; +1 to the above: simpler is better and defaulting to overridable for<br>&gt; public members on an open class is simpler... invariants can be protected<br>&gt; by the &#39;final&#39; keyword.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If we were to default to non-overridable, a more consistent &#39;open&#39; on the<br>&gt; method is preferred over overridable for me... open class, open method...<br>&gt; much better imho...<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Do we really need an open keyword ?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As already said, if open does nothing more than allowing the class to be<br>&gt; subclassed, why not simply make the class subclassable if it contains at<br>&gt; least one overridable member ?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Thats a good point actually… but looks like Review #2 has already started…<br>&gt; and &#39;open&#39; is available for both class and method there… I suppose its the<br>&gt; whole &quot;default to safe&quot;, just in case someone made one method &#39;open&#39; they<br>&gt; may not have intended to actually make the whole class open… (also see<br>&gt; below)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In case we require an open keyword, what would happen if someone mark a<br>&gt; member overridable, but does not make the class open ? Will the compiler<br>&gt; emit an error, or make the class implicitly « open » ?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In proposal #2 looks like it would generate an error, but Xiaodi Wu has<br>&gt; said that it should be allowed and not generate an error per SE-0025<br>&gt; &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md&gt;<br>&gt; .<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md#complications-with-private-types&gt;Take<br>&gt; a look at<br>&gt; &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md#complications-with-private-types&gt;:<br>&gt; &quot;The compiler should not warn when a broader level of access control is<br>&gt; used within a type with more restrictive access, such as internal within<br>&gt; a private type.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I&#39;m fairly sure that does not apply to open as it&#39;s fairly orthogonal to<br>&gt; other access control modifiers.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>I agree that the statement in SE-0025 by itself doesn&#39;t necessary apply to<br>`open` because they are somewhat orthogonal. But the stated rationale in<br>SE-0025 applies equally to `open`, so I think this proposal would be<br>improved by having `open` behave similarly in this respect. Here&#39;s why:<br></p><p>The rationale stated in SE-0025 is that it allows a person who controls the<br>type to design as though it will have broader access than it actually does.<br>For instance, I can design an internal class as though it will be public,<br>and when I&#39;m satisfied with it, I can flip the switch and actually make it<br>public by adding a single access modifier. That rationale falls down for<br>classes if I cannot design a `public open` class without already making it<br>`public open`.<br></p><p>&gt; - Andre<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160716/24ff4154/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Returned for revision] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>July 15, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jul 14, 2016, at 11:27 PM, Brent Royal-Gordon via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jul 14, 2016, at 2:39 PM, Chris Lattner &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; asks the community for an in-depth discussion of the secondary points of the proposal: does it make sense to require every member to be marked as “overridable” in order to be overridden by an open subclass outside of the current module?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; To be clear: You want this discussion to happen in the next review thread, rather than in this thread?<br></p><p>Yep, I’ll kick off another review period as soon as the proposal is revised (hopefully today).<br></p><p>-Chris<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/831ba6eb600af4a6587f263373921bb2?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Returned for revision] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Tino Heth</string> &lt;2th at gmx.de&gt;<p>July 15, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; does it make sense to require every member to be marked as “overridable” in order to be overridden by an open subclass outside of the current module?<br></p><p>Despite of probably being one of the most passionate defenders against adding restrictions on subclassing, I&#39;ve to accept the clear statement made by the core team, so the imho only consequent answer to this question is requiring overridable on every single method:<br>- Whatever the perceived benefits of forbidding subclassing are, they are the same for each specific method<br>- It is the same principle that is applied to access control<br></p><p>For me, &quot;open&quot; has a tiny disadvantage, because I tend to read it as a verb, but it&#39;s most likely the best choice, and I recommend to re-use it and drop overridable:<br>- open is shorter<br>- open is less confusing<br>- access control follows the same principle of reuse<br></p><p>If the goal is taken serious, imho it is also questionable wether it is good to allow writing public properties without explicit rights to do so: It&#39;s a similar situation (you can read but not write vs. you can call but not override), and there is the proven template of default file access rights in UNIX.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160715/39945e41/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d4fb9162c777a5d6d0b1fb00893d709?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Returned for revision] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Haravikk</string> &lt;swift-evolution at haravikk.me&gt;<p>July 15, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On 14 Jul 2016, at 22:39, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; To sum this all up, the core team is rejecting this proposal and requesting a revision to change the concrete syntax to “public open class Foo” instead of “subclassable class Foo&quot;.  <br></p><p>Minor point, but if we&#39;re going with the idea of public open and public final for declaration, is it worth re-raising the idea of bracketed accessibility modifiers?
