As you see I’m having similar problems :-)<br></p><p><br>&gt; It depends on the form of the subtyping support. If &quot;subtype&quot; just means &quot;implicit conversion without sharing compatible representations&quot;, as having Float be a subtype of Double would be, that wouldn&#39;t necessarily make much sense.

Is that what you mean by pseudo-subtyping?<br></p><p>So, you are probably right that Self does not make sense in value types.<br></p><p>An alternative might be introducing references for value types but this might complicate the language more than we would like. In that case Self would apply to the dynamic type of a reference (like for classes).<br></p><p>-Thorsten<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5451f7df31d36d0159a018706aec7adb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Adding a Self type name shortcut for static member access</strong> from <string>Erica Sadun</string> &lt;erica at ericasadun.com&gt;<p>April 27, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Apr 27, 2016, at 1:51 PM, Thorsten Seitz via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; So, you are probably right that Self does not make sense in value types.<br></p><p>I courteously disagree for the reasons stated in the proposal:<br></p><p>* Self introduces consistency across types<br>* It’s succinct and clear, enhancing readability<br></p><p>It may not be especially expressive in value types but I believe it remains valuable, which is a different question.<br></p><p>Regardless, I believe this proposal will be delayed until the question of `Type.self` vs `Type` is first ironed out as some of the design details are predicated on how that is treated.<br></p><p>best regards,<br></p><p>— E<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160427/dfd43e93/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85a454a69ee2cf2ac4b990dc9e87b664?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Adding a Self type name shortcut for static member access</strong> from <string>Thorsten Seitz</string> &lt;tseitz42 at icloud.com&gt;<p>April 27, 2016 at 10:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Am 27.04.2016 um 22:00 schrieb Erica Sadun &lt;erica at ericasadun.com&gt;:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Apr 27, 2016, at 1:51 PM, Thorsten Seitz via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; So, you are probably right that Self does not make sense in value types.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I courteously disagree for the reasons stated in the proposal:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * Self introduces consistency across types<br>&gt; * It’s succinct and clear, enhancing readability<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It may not be especially expressive in value types but I believe it remains valuable, which is a different question.<br></p><p>Oops, you are right, of course.
