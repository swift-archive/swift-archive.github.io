If not, please remind me what the process is (and maybe read on anyway?)!<br></p><p>Interoperation:<br>  If I have an existing ObjC (or just C) code baae that uses dispatch_get_specific, how does it interoperate with Swift code and DispatchSpecificKey&lt;T&gt;?   How do I annotate my void* keys to bridge them into Swift?  (I don’t know of any library that used dispatch keys in API, but I do know of plenty that use them internally and it would hinder Swift migration to have an all-or-nothing migration here!)<br></p><p><br>Apparently Incomplete (perfectly understandable if I’m jumping the gun and commenting early):<br></p><p>DispatchGroup:<br>  I can see it has been renamed, and what the equivalent of dispatch_group_async is, but I don’t see dispatch_group_wait or dispatch_group_notify’s new names anywhere.<br></p><p>DispatchSemaphore:<br>  Again I see the new name, but I don’t see <br></p><p>Bikeshed:<br>  queue.asynchronously(…) oh dear god so much typing…um, I mean, er, “async is a term of art, and perfectly appropriate here”<br>  queue.synchronously(…) yeah, that is a lot of letters…and “sync” is a perfectly fine term of art, can we use it?<br></p><p>Color Me Impressed:<br>  “ all without adding runtime overhead” and we have the DispatchQueue.asynchronously taking 3 arguments with default values.   Can the Swift compiler really turn a call with all the arguments in the default state into a dispatch_async call without runtime overhead of checking for nil/.unspecified, and []?  (not “can” = “sure, someday”, but “yeah, it does that sort of thing, maybe even here”)<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
