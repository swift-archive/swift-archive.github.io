The problem I’d see for the example scenario is that the semantics of the property may be completely different, in which case having a value that the protocol doesn’t expect may break it. The only adequate protections for that kind of matter is either preventing declarations of the same property across multiple included protocols or giving them their own namespaces (which would be a problem in itself).<br></p><p>&gt; On 27 Feb 2016, at 20:30, David Scrève via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	I have already considered adding store properties to protocols before proposing abstract classes, but there are some issues : <br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1 - If protocols can have stored properties and default method implementation, how do you explain to newby the difference between a class and a protocol ?
