In this case, extending protocol to<br>&gt; value container might be an interesting way to respond to this. Anyway, we<br>&gt; might keep the abstract keyword.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Regards,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; David<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Le 4 d?c. 2015 ? 10:11, T.J. Usiyan &lt;griotspeak at gmail.com&gt; a ?crit :<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hello,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This is an interesting example. I can&#39;t refute it without questioning<br>&gt; decisions/intent rather than code so I&#39;ll just say that the `abstract`<br>&gt; quality  you&#39;re after still seems like it should be fit into the protocol<br>&gt; family of features.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; TJ<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Fri, Dec 4, 2015 at 3:56 AM, David Scr?ve &lt;david.screve at dlta-studio.com<br>&gt; &gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Hello TJ,<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Actually not completely?Protocol does not handle properties storage. Only<br>&gt;&gt; class (and struct) can be made abstract.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Doing this with protocol and class required the use of both and you need<br>&gt;&gt; to enforce developer to inherit from class and implement protocol.. An<br>&gt;&gt; abstract class encapsulate both on this in a single entity.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Here is a sample class for WebService :<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; class WebService {<br>&gt;&gt;     private var lastModified : NSDate<br>&gt;&gt;     var url : String?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     init() {<br>&gt;&gt;         lastModified=NSDate()<br>&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     func performCall() {<br>&gt;&gt;         print(self.url)<br>&gt;&gt;         self.lastModified=NSDate()<br>&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; As written below, I can create a WebService instance?but I would like to<br>&gt;&gt; forbid this because URL is a property that must be implemented by inherited<br>&gt;&gt; classes.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I I use a protocol and Protocol extension, I will not be able to have<br>&gt;&gt; lastModified stored value.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; My proposal is to add abstract keyword as below :<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; abstract class WebService {<br>&gt;&gt;     private var lastModified : NSDate<br>&gt;&gt;     abstract var url : String?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     init() {<br>&gt;&gt;         lastModified=NSDate()<br>&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     func performCall() {<br>&gt;&gt;         print(self.url)<br>&gt;&gt;         self.lastModified=NSDate()<br>&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Then I will not be able to create a WebService object, and enforced to<br>&gt;&gt; implement url property in inherited classes.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Regards,<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; David<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Le 4 d?c. 2015 ? 09:43, T.J.

If you&#39;ve watched Protocol-Oriented<br>&gt;&gt; Programming in Swift [Session 408]<br>&gt;&gt; &lt;https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015-408/&gt;, slides 168 and<br>&gt;&gt; on, once he begins talking about Protocol Extensions, is the relevant part.<br>&gt;&gt; It looks like the functionality that you&#39;ve described is already present in<br>&gt;&gt; this feature.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; TJ<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; On Fri, Dec 4, 2015 at 3:30 AM, David Scr?ve &lt;<br>&gt;&gt; david.screve at dlta-studio.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         Hi Everyone,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         Nice to see this new swift-evolution process?.I?m not sure to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; completely understand the whole process of requesting evolutions, but I?m<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; trying<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; to do?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         As I develop sort of framework, I usually have classes that I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; wanted to partially in the framework and force the user to implement others<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; parts.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         For example, I have a WebService class that manage the whole<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; process to perform asynchronous call, error management.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         This class has an abstract property that is specific for each<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; WebService call.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         Then I would like to make the URL property abstract and,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; consequently, the whole WebService class abstract : The WebService cannot<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; be directly instantiated.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         The goal of this feature would be to extend to method.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         This behavior already exists in Java and is really useful.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         The workaround is to make an URL property that returns invalid<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; value or make assertion, but the error is only detected at runtime.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         My proposal would be to just add a keyword before func, class or<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; var.
