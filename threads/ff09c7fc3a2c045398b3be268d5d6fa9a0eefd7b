The proposal is available here:<br></p><p>        https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0085-package-manager-command-name.md<br></p><p>Reviews are an important part of the Swift evolution process. All reviews should be sent to the swift-evolution mailing list at<br></p><p>	https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>or, if you would like to keep your feedback private, directly to the review manager.<br></p><p>What goes into a review?<br></p><p>The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review through constructive criticism and contribute to the direction of Swift. When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br></p><p>	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br></p><p>	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br></p><p>Thank you,<br></p><p> - Daniel<br>Review Manager<br></p><p><br>_______________________________________________<br>swift-evolution mailing list<br>swift-evolution at swift.org<br>https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3488bcf34d8c45d917ed27d67a0ffa45?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution] [Review] SE-0085: Package Manager Command Names</strong> from <string>David Hart</string> &lt;david at hartbit.com&gt;<p>May 10, 2016 at 08:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt;    * What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>+1 This proposal makes the package manager a first-class tool, instead of a set of command options.<br></p><p>&gt;    * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>It should be addressed before it goes public.<br></p><p>&gt;    * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes.<br></p><p>&gt;    * If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>I&#39;m used to using npm, pod, gem, bundle.

However I think<br>we&#39;re talking about two things: 1. commonly used name for the tool (I use<br>SwiftPM), 2. short alias to make triggering it on the command line easier<br>(I really like &#39;spm&#39;).<br></p><p>Whatever alias we use, it&#39;s an alias - the canonical command is will be<br>&#39;swift package&#39; either way, which is discoverable and clear.

Also, if anyone is confused what &#39;spm&#39; does,<br>they can just run it, which will show the help section, exactly like npm,<br>nvm, gem, pod etc.<br></p><p>(One more problem I have with the alias being &#39;swiftpm&#39;: when you try to<br>use autocompletion e.g. in zsh, if you type &#39;sw&#39; and hit tab, you&#39;ll get<br>&#39;swift&#39; and related tools, but never &#39;swiftpm&#39; on the first tab hit, so<br>you&#39;ll really have type it out fully every time, because it doesn&#39;t have a<br>unique prefix. &#39;spm&#39; is short enough to type in under a second, so I don&#39;t<br>autocompletion is needed here.)<br></p><p>Honza<br></p><p><br>On Tue, May 10, 2016 at 6:57 PM Jean-Daniel Dupas via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;<br>&gt; Le 10 mai 2016 à 18:38, Rick Ballard via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; a écrit :<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On May 10, 2016, at 8:49 AM, Matthew Johnson via swift-build-dev &lt;<br>&gt; swift-build-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On May 10, 2016, at 2:19 AM, Dan Appel via swift-evolution &lt;<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; +1 to `swift package` being a little too verbose.
