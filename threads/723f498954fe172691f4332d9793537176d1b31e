I was not able to find non-mutating variations of append and remove, which might have looked like:<br></p><p>let myNewArray =  existingArray.newArrayByAppending(element: someValue)<br>let myOtherNewArray =  existingArray.newArrayByRemovingElement(At: someIndex)<br></p><p>(method names intentionally chosen to be exceedingly verbose)<br></p><p>Did I miss something?<br>What would have been the best way to find the answer to such question on my own?<br></p><p>I tried using Dash (with the Swift 3 docSet), and the Xcode 8 beta 6 documentation window (in addition to several attempts using auto-complete).<br></p><p>What is the most idiomatic way to accomplish this simple thing?<br></p><p>Thanks,<br></p><p>Jean-Denis<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/edbd5f1c2f535b14165ae883fa7c3f37?s=50"></div><header><strong>how to create an array by adding/removing from another array?</strong> from <string>Jens Alfke</string> &lt;jens at mooseyard.com&gt;<p>August 24, 2016 at 08:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Aug 24, 2016, at 7:07 AM, Jean-Denis Muys via swift-users &lt;swift-users at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; However I was wondering if it was possible (preferable?) to do it in a more “functional” style.<br></p><p>Apple’s Foundation framework has Array.arrayByAddingObject (but not ByRemoving).<br></p><p>However, this would not be preferable (at least in performance) due to all the copying.
