An example of the format of a bulleted<br>list is shown near the bottom of newsletter below:<br></p><p>http://swiftsandbox.io/issues/1<br></p><p>(This isn&#39;t intended to be a plug for the newsletter; it&#39;s just an offer to<br>help.)<br></p><p>John<br></p><p>&gt; On Dec 22, 2015, at 10:29 PM, Kevin Ballard via swift-evolution<br>&lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; During the development of Rust prior to v1.0, one of the things that<br>really helped with keeping up with changes (both in the language and in the<br>stdlib) was Corey Richardson&#39;s weekly newsletter/blog titled This Week In<br>Rust. Since 1.0, that was actually turned into its own website at<br>https://this-week-in-rust.org and appears to still be going strong<br>(although I assume someone else has taken over responsibility at this<br>point).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What Corey did with This Week In Rust was he went through all the pull<br>requests that were merged in the past week, found the &quot;important&quot; ones, and<br>compiled a list of one-line summaries that linked to each PR in question.<br>He made sure to call out any breaking changes (this was pre-1.0 so there<br>were breaking changes almost every week) as well as anything that seemed<br>like it would be of interest to people looking for a weekly summary. He<br>also listed RFCs (Rust&#39;s equivalent for our swift-evolution proposals) as<br>well as any interesting news from the community (such as new projects or<br>libraries). This weekly newsletter was posted on his blog and also posted<br>on the Rust mailing list. I&#39;m really not sure where he got all the time to<br>do this (I believe he was studying at University at the time), and I don&#39;t<br>know how much time it actually took, but it was widely regarded as being<br>extremely helpful.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I&#39;d really love to see someone with enough time on their hands start up<br>something similar for Swift. This would include interesting or important<br>changes to the language/stdlib as well as news about proposals (e.g.<br>newly-submitted ones, ones up for review in the coming week, the<br>accepted/rejected resolution of them, and finally news about when<br>implementations get merged in). Ideally, Apple would actually pay someone<br>to do this, but I suspect it&#39;s unlikely that there&#39;s anyone involved with<br>Swift at Apple that has the time for something like this. And of course I<br>don&#39;t have time for this myself (that&#39;s why I want the newsletter, so I can<br>make sure I don&#39;t miss anything important!).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -Kevin Ballard<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151224/15f55a43/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
