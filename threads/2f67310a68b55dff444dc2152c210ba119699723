I expanded this section of the evolution page (https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution#out-of-scope) to clarify that:<br></p><p><br>Out of Scope<br>...<br>â€¢ Major new Library Functionality: The Swift Standard Library is focused on providing core &quot;language&quot; functionality as well as common datastructures. The &quot;corelibs&quot; projects are focused on providing existing Foundation functionality in a portable way. Major new libraries (e.g. a new Logging subsystem) are best developed as independent projects on GitHub (or elsewhere) and organized with the Swift Package Manager. Beyond Swift 3 we may consider standardizing popular packages or expanding the scope of the project. We will consider minor extensions to the existing feature set.<br></p><p><br>-Chris<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151207/e050ff14/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
