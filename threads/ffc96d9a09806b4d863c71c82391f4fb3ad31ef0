Initially I<br>&gt; thought the proposed API was acceptable, barring some quibbles about<br>&gt; naming, but I think Dave Abrahams has made some good points in this<br>&gt; thread, and so I&#39;ll just say that I very much support getting this kind<br>&gt; of functionality in the stdlib, but if Dave Abrahams thinks that the API<br>&gt; as proposed isn&#39;t what we want in the long term, then I&#39;ll defer to his<br>&gt; judgement.<br></p><p>I should be clear: I based that assessment on what the proposal itself<br>said.  I don&#39;t even know the details of the alternative that the<br>proposal suggests would be better in the long term.  The fact that the<br>proposal is suggesting we do something that it says might not be the<br>best long-term solution, with no other justification than that it will<br>work “in the meantime” leaves me lacking confidence that the proposal<br>is sufficiently well-considered to accept.<br></p><p>&gt; Also, given the proposed API, the input really should be a SequenceType.<br>&gt; I recognize that it&#39;s calling through to _StringBuffer.fromCodeUnits()<br>&gt; which takes a CollectionType, but the only reason that takes a<br>&gt; CollectionType is so it can pre-calculate the size of the UTF-16 buffer,<br>&gt; and I don&#39;t think that limitation should be exposed through the public<br>&gt; API. It would be better to change _StringBuffer.fromCodeUnits() to take<br>&gt; a SequenceType and use the _preprocessingPass machinery to choose<br>&gt; between the fast-path of pre-allocating the buffer and a slow path of<br>&gt; growing the buffer as needed.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -Kevin Ballard<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Thu, Feb 11, 2016, at 04:41 PM, Douglas Gregor wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The review of SE-0027 &quot;Expose code unit initializers on String&quot;<br>&gt;&gt; begins now and runs through February 16, 2016.

When writing your review, here are some questions<br>&gt;&gt; you might want to answer in your review:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;  * What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt;&gt;  * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a<br>&gt;&gt;    change to Swift?<br>&gt;&gt;  * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt;&gt;  * If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar<br>&gt;&gt;    feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt;&gt;  * How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick<br>&gt;&gt;    reading, or an in-depth study?
