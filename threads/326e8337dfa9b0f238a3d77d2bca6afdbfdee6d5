I did give it a try previously from the REPL. And yes, fails if scripted. <br></p><p>I think what you&#39;re running into here is the different ways the REPL, Playgrounds, and .swift files are initialized (esp. with respect to globals). There&#39;s some interesting talk about this on the (original) Swift blog at Apple: https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/#article-18<br></p><p>&quot;Most Swift files in your app are order-independent, meaning you can use a type before it is defined, and can even import modules at the bottom of the file (although that is not recommended Swift style.)&quot;<br></p><p>&quot;Code within a playground file is order-dependent, run in top-down lexical order. For example, you can’t use a type before you define it.&quot;<br></p><p>&quot;The exception is a special file named “main.swift”, which behaves much like a playground file, but is built with your app’s source code. &quot;<br></p><p>&quot;Given how Swift determines where to start executing an app, how should global variables work? ... In a single-file program, code is executed top-down, similar to the behavior of variables within a function. Pretty simple. The answer for complex apps is less obvious... [Swift] runs the initializer for a global the first time it is referenced, similar to Java ... which is the best of all worlds: it allows custom initializers, startup time in Swift scales cleanly with no global initializers to slow it down, and the order of execution is completely predictable.&quot;<br></p><p>This was from back in beta days, but I&#39;m pretty sure it still applies.<br></p><p>-- <br>Cheers!<br>-jemmons<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20160110/52b3e3e7/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
