It seems like you<br>&gt; can’t assume much about a generic `Arithmetic` type, e.g. in a generic<br>&gt; context I can’t reliably assume even things like these:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - `(x / y) * y == x` (or even “is close to&quot; x) <br>&gt; - `(x + x + … + x) / n ==  x` (for `x` added together `n` times)<br>&gt; - `((x + y) + z) == (x + (y + z))` (etc.)<br>&gt; - `(x + y) - y == x`(? I think...)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; …and so on; am I missing something? <br>&gt;<br>&gt; If `Arithmetic` is as lacking in semantics as it seems, then it feels<br>&gt; like one of those “bag of syntax” protocols that keep getting<br>&gt; mentioned as against the stdlib philosophy.<br></p><p>Well, this is a special case for two reasons:<br></p><p>1. Floating point is weird.  Technically, it doesn&#39;t obey any<br>   mathematical laws understandable by people whose name is not Steve<br>   Canon.  However, approximately nobody programs as though that&#39;s the<br>   case, because it would be impossible.  We program as though floating<br>   point types are idealized real numbers and then we deal with the fact<br>   that they&#39;re only a pretty good approximation as an afterthought at<br>   best.  Within the limits of that approximation, floating point fits<br>   into a set of laws governing Arithmetic... that we admittedly have<br>   not written down, but should.<br></p><p>2. The proper semantic breakdown of protocols in this area is too<br>   complex for most people to handle (you can find some figures in<br>   http://www.cs.indiana.edu/pub/techreports/TR638.pdf), and we&#39;re not<br>   sure yet which subset of these belongs in the standard library.<br></p><p><br>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
