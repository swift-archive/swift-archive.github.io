In that spirit, here are some thoughts:<br></p><p>Arbitrary-precision integers (bigints) are a logical first step. Bigints<br>then enable practical support for rationals. (With bigints, rational<br>operations need not fail because of integer overflow.) Adding at least<br>these two numerical types would bring Swift far closer wrt numerical<br>support wrt languages like Clojure or Ruby.<br></p><p>Many languages make a distinction between fixed precision integers and<br>bigints (i.e. Haskell&#39;s Int vs Integer). I propose the definition of two<br>related types: ArbitraryPrecisionInteger and Integer.<br></p><p>ArbitraryPrecisionInteger is a struct wrapping a pointer to a byte buffer,<br>much like how Swift&#39;s Array, Set, and Dictionary collection types work<br>(c.f.<br>https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2015-04-17-lets-build-swiftarray.html).<br>It wraps an arbitrarily large integer within a container adhering to value<br>semantics. Perhaps this can be exposed as part of the stdlib, or a<br>&#39;private&#39; implementation detail.<br></p><p>Integer is intended to be used by application developers, and most of the<br>arithmetic/comparison functionality exposed by the stdlib deals with<br>arguments and return values of type Integer. Integers are enums:<br></p><p>enum Integer {<br>case Small(Int)<br>case Big(ArbitraryPrecisionInteger)<br>}<br></p><p>Like ArbitraryPrecisionInteger, Integer represents an arbitrary-precision<br>integer. It wraps either a fixed-size (64-bit) signed integer, or a bigint.<br>Integer&#39;s invariant is that integers within the range of an Int are always<br>stored as an Int. This is enforced by the mathematical operations defined<br>on arguments of type Integer. This allows for a slow path (consisting of<br>operations that are conducted on ArbitraryPrecisionIntegers), and a fast<br>path (consisting of checked operations on Ints, with automatic promotion to<br>ArbitraryPrecisionInteger as necessary). Fast path operations, in the best<br>case, need not allocate heap memory or invoke retain/release operations.<br></p><p>Integers can be unconditionally constructed (promoted) from Ints, and can<br>be conditionally demoted to Ints ( () -&gt; Int? ). (All Ints are Integers,<br>but not all Integers are Ints.)<br></p><p>A useful compiler support feature might be a &quot;BigIntegerLiteralConvertible&quot;<br>protocol, which allows literal integers out of the range of Ints to be<br>assigned to Integer values. Swift can already tell if an integer literal is<br>out of range (e.g. &quot;let x : Int8 = 123456&quot;), so there is some precedent.<br>This would be a more elegant solution than requiring bigints to be<br>initialized via strings (as some other arbitrary precision arithmetic<br>libraries do).<br></p><p>Rational numbers are represented by the Rational struct which encapsulates<br>two Integers, the numerator and denominator. Rationals can be conditionally<br>constructed explicitly from two Integers (as long as the denominator isn&#39;t<br>0), or from a single Integer (all Integers are Rationals, but the opposite<br>is not true). A good invariant for Rationals might be having them always<br>represented in the most simplified form - for example, Rational(2, 6)<br>should be represented internally as 1/3 when constructed.<br></p><p>Future topics to explore include complex numbers, arbitrary-precision<br>floating-point numbers, and fixed-precision and/or decimal number types.<br></p><p>Given that I&#39;m little more than a dabbler in these topics (most of my<br>expertise came from trying to reverse-assemble Clojure&#39;s numerical<br>support), feedback from someone with experience and/or expertise wrt<br>numerical/scientific computing, bignum libraries, numerical towers, etc.<br>would be hugely appreciated.<br></p><p>Best regards,<br>Austin<br></p><p><br>On Thu, Dec 3, 2015 at 6:52 PM, Austin Zheng &lt;austinzheng at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Thanks, Chris and Dmitri!
