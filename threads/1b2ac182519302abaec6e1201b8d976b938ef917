My suggestion in the pull request was to just encode a dictionary of dates to strings sampling a well known range before hand. This way it would be verifiable on both linux and Darwin as “correct” in accordance with the version of Foundation.framework that ships on Mac OS X and iOS. <br></p><p>The rest of the additions seemed pretty reasonable to me, except the case of calling popen to run a secondary script that may take extra execution time and add extra complexity other than just a dictionary of some good example date to string conversions (which actually could be utilized to reverse the test as well for scanning).<br></p><p>&gt; On Feb 19, 2016, at 4:13 PM, Taylor Franklin via swift-corelibs-dev &lt;swift-corelibs-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hello,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Are there any plans to integrate this commit into the main repo because I would love build off of the code within it, seeing that NSDateFormatter still seems incomplete.
