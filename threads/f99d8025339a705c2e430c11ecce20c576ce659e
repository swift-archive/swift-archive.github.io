Specifically, I can no longer construct a dictionary like this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; let userInfo: [String: AnyObject] = [<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	kSomeStandardKey: self.name, // a String<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	kAnotherKey: self.childNames // an Array of Strings<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; NSNotificationCenter.default().postNotificationName(MyNotification, self, userInfo)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The fix isn’t that hard—just add “as NSString” or “as NSArray”—but it is a bit of extra noise that we currently don’t have. If the type checker can still offer that fix-it, then I’m not sure we’d actually get any compiler simplification out of it…although I suppose it might make the happy path faster.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The CFString issue Jacob brought up is also a little unfortunate, although that’s about the direction that already requires an explicit coercion. But this probably affects calling CF functions that take CFStrings, since IIRC we don’t treat that the same as NSString at the moment, and CFArray will never have generics.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, I’ve been out of the Cocoa community for a while now, so I don’t really have a sense of how often this comes up in practice, and how much the explicit coercion costs (psychologically). So I’m with Brent: do we have information on the changes needed for real-world projects?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Jordan<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Apr 26, 2016, at 13:54, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The review of &quot;SE-0072: Fully eliminate implicit bridging conversions from Swift&quot; begins now and runs through May 2.
