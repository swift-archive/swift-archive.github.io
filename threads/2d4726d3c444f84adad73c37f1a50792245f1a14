Taking the NSOutlineViewDelegate example, ideally it would be generic<br>and you would supply it a type, but that not being the case I would be<br>hesitant to do the implicit type casting. What happens if you get it wrong<br>in one place and not the other? Something like<br></p><p>    func outlineView(outlineView: NSOutlineView, viewForTableColumn<br>tableColumn: NSTableColumn, item: String) -&gt; NSView? {<br>        ...<br>    }<br></p><p>    func outlineView(outlineView: NSOutlineView, shouldSelectItem item:<br>NSURL) -&gt; Bool {<br>        ...<br>    }<br></p><p>I&#39;m not sure how NSOutlineView should function in that case. Does one of<br>them silently fail? Cause a runtime exception? With AnyObject, imperfect as<br>it is, you have the opportunity to do the casting yourself and handle<br>errors gracefully. You could even wrap it in your own generic protocol that<br>is just a proxy that does the type casting. Or extend the protocol and<br>overload the methods with more strongly typed arguments.<br></p><p>I actually think making the programmer be explicit about types is an<br>advantage of things like generic protocols. It helps avoid problems like<br>the inconsistent types thing. Obviously, you can still get the types wrong,<br>but that feels like a product of a bad API and not deficiency in the<br>language.<br></p><p>On Wed, Dec 16, 2015 at 4:40 PM Terrence Katzenbaer &lt;tkatzenbaer at me.com&gt;<br>wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Sorry, that last reply was impolitely succinct.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In practice, doing that workaround is strange and difficult to remember<br>&gt; (especially for beginners).
