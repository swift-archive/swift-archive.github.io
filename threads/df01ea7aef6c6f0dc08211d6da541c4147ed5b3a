We’ve focused most on naming because that’s it&#39;s fundamental and has such a significant impact, but I agree that many of these other areas could benefit from guidelines. For some (e.g., struct or class?), I expect we’ll need more time for the community to establish best practices before we can codify them.<br></p><p>	- Doug<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; Best,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Daniel<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jan 30, 2016, at 3:18 PM, Douglas Gregor via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Due to ongoing discussion of the API guidelines and related proposals, as well as the large-scale impact these changes will have on Swift, we’re extending the review of SE-0005, SE-0006, and SE-0023 through next Friday, February 5th.
