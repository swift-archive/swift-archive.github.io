Tuples can be extremely useful for pattern matching, returning multiple values from a function, and destructing content to the list. C# has tuples as a named type as well I believe. Currently, Tuples in Swift are anonymous types that have limited functionality but this proposal can help solve that.<br></p><p>Languages like C#, Scala, et al. that decided that Tuple should be a nominal type have, in my opinion, made the wrong choice.  A tuple is an anonymous product; its content and not its name is what is important otherwise you&#39;d just use a struct.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; The underlying implementations of this proposal can allow the following :<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1) having parameters and return values of type : Tuple<br>&gt; - enforces much more intuitive and clean code <br>&gt; - less code too read <br></p><p>This is already valid in Swift.<br></p><p>func flip&lt;A, B&gt;(_ t : (A, B)) -&gt; (B, A) {<br>  return (t.1, t.0)<br>}<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; 2) implicit &amp; explicit optionals with tuples !!! <br>&gt; - Can definitely take out many nested optional chains if tuples internally checks for .Some or .None in each variable stored inside of an optional of type Tuple.<br></p><p>This operation will not scale well without variadic generics.  Do you really want ~8 different functions in stdlib that examine the contents of tuples when it&#39;s much easier to just pattern match on the tuple in a `switch` or `case let` statement?<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; 3) making tuples variable declarations more popular for functional call<br>&gt; - parameter names in function calls within tuple variables can be used as getter<br></p><p>This is, again, already supported.<br></p><p>func project(_ t : (l : String, r : Int)) -&gt; Int {<br>  return t.r<br>}<br></p><p>f((&quot;Hello World, 42))<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; My proposal was very brief but I hope its one worth embracing. I didnt get to talk about applications but those are pretty self-explanatory. This definitely widens the vision for Swift and could be a &quot;a-ha&quot; thing for Swift developers. :)<br></p><p>In short, I don&#39;t really see how this achieves the goal of making tuples more flexible.  Perhaps you have concrete examples of what is wrong and what this proposal intends to fix?<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Best Regards,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Muhammad T.
