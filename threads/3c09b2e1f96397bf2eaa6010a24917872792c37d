What is the behavior if the arguments/return values of a function are themselves unions?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; And finally, would it be a better idea merely to promote generics to &quot;full&quot; types, without the use of an explicit union builtin?  The approach here is more narrowly tailored, but that is not necessarily the right language design.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151211/a39c9aa7/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a838c63b9093a77fb88231d65effa3b3?s=50"></div><header><strong>union types</strong> from <string>Drew Crawford</string> &lt;drew at sealedabstract.com&gt;<p>December 11, 2015 at 09:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Dec 11, 2015, at 9:01 PM, Joe Groff &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; with its Product type generalized to Any. <br></p><p><br>In the alternate example<br></p><p>protocol Factory {<br>    typealias Product: ProductProtocol<br>    func make() -&gt; Product<br>    var description : String { get }<br>}<br></p><p>would it generalize to ProductProtocol (e.g. not Any)?<br></p><p>That is potentially a good solution, especially if compatible with existing Swift 3 work.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151211/becf92db/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/06c1dcc7dce6a93d194b9c013376e3f0?s=50"></div><header><strong>union types</strong> from <string>Joe Groff</string> &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt;<p>December 11, 2015 at 07:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Dec 11, 2015, at 7:48 PM, Drew Crawford &lt;drew at sealedabstract.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Dec 11, 2015, at 9:01 PM, Joe Groff &lt;jgroff at apple.com &lt;mailto:jgroff at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; with its Product type generalized to Any. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; In the alternate example<br>&gt; <br>&gt; protocol Factory {<br>&gt;     typealias Product: ProductProtocol<br>&gt;     func make() -&gt; Product<br>&gt;     var description : String { get }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; would it generalize to ProductProtocol (e.g. not Any)?<br></p><p>Yeah, when generalizing a protocol type, we ought to be able to either generalize the associated types to their upper bounds, for use cases like yours, or constrain them to specific types, for the AnyGenerator&lt;T&gt; kind of case.<br></p><p>-Joe<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151211/11a4adaa/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3488bcf34d8c45d917ed27d67a0ffa45?s=50"></div><header><strong>union types</strong> from <string>David Hart</string> &lt;david at hartbit.com&gt;<p>December 12, 2015 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Type-erasure to the rescue?
