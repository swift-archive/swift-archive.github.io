This appears to be much more than what I get from build-script -t when I run tests locally.  Maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding the intended role of our smoke tests, but since nobody is correcting me, I&#39;m betting not.<br></p><p>Anyway, regardless of the explanation, what can be done about this?  Between a spurious failure in LLDB and the length of the smoke test it took several hours to be able to merge something that could not possibly break the build, which seems absurd.<br></p><p>Sent from my iPad<br></p><p>&gt; On Oct 18, 2016, at 11:44 PM, mishal_shah &lt;mishal_shah at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Oct 18, 2016, at 8:29 PM, Michael Gottesman &lt;mgottesman at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Oct 18, 2016, at 6:40 PM, Dave Abrahams via swift-dev &lt;swift-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I thought the smoke test was supposed to be a fairly quick test<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; that just covered the basics, but it seems to be doing plenty of *really<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; long* tests, for example:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://ci.swift.org/job/swift-PR-Linux-smoke-test/1916/console<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; which has already been running for over 30 minutes.
