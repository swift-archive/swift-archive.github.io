For example, if you’re searching for “a” in the String “a”, you’d return true. Same thing for search for a nothing in a nothing-if the object is what you’re searching for, you can say it contains it.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; Again, Strings to me are just character arrays…<br>&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Nevin<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt; which, to me,  implies that one will never find an occurrence<br>&gt;&gt; of an empty string within another string,<br>&gt;&gt; for the very simple reason that an empty string<br>&gt;&gt; does not exist within another string. **<br>&gt;&gt; Ergo: “false” is the right evaluation when s2.isEmpty.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; ** In my mental model, a String is just an array of 0...n characters,<br>&gt;&gt;   like it is in most languages, very straightforward.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  (returning false) This is exactly the reason why NSString does that, <br>&gt;&gt; for more than 20 years, why change it?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; AFAIK no one has complained about this for years, <br>&gt;&gt; because imho it is logically sound. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; for a compiler this is very easy<br>&gt;&gt; all it has to do is to return False<br>&gt;&gt; when either s1 or s2 is empty.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Ted<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On 19.07.2016, at 23:11, Jacob Bandes-Storch &lt;jtbandes at gmail.com &lt;mailto:jtbandes at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Not that it&#39;s needed, but another +1 from me.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.hasPrefix(p) should be true iff there exists some string x for which p+x == a.

For example, if you’re searching for “a” in the String “a”, you’d return true. Same thing for search for a nothing in a nothing-if the object is what you’re searching for, you can say it contains it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Again, Strings to me are just character arrays…<br>&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Nevin<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; which, to me,  implies that one will never find an occurrence<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; of an empty string within another string,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; for the very simple reason that an empty string<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; does not exist within another string. **<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Ergo: “false” is the right evaluation when s2.isEmpty.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ** In my mental model, a String is just an array of 0...n characters,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   like it is in most languages, very straightforward.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  (returning false) This is exactly the reason why NSString does that, <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; for more than 20 years, why change it?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; AFAIK no one has complained about this for years, <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; because imho it is logically sound. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; for a compiler this is very easy<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; all it has to do is to return False<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; when either s1 or s2 is empty.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Ted<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On 19.07.2016, at 23:11, Jacob Bandes-Storch &lt;jtbandes at gmail.com &lt;mailto:jtbandes at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not that it&#39;s needed, but another +1 from me.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a.hasPrefix(p) should be true iff there exists some string x for which p+x == a.

I couldn’t find any.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One other way of rephrasing it: to get<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; `false` for str.hasPrefix(&quot;&quot;), you actually need special-case code in<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; hasPrefix to check for the empty string,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; again, maybe it should throw a run-time error instead.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and the caller may well also<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; need special-case code to handle the fact that the result is not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mathematically consistent with other cases on the continuum.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; In this context as “continuum” :<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;   are you referring to  “sets” or “collections” here?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; what other cases?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Doing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; things that way doesn&#39;t work in practice for real programs.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; please explain thank you, because I see no problems at<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; all with the current NSString-like evaluation…<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I’d put an s.isEmpty() in front of it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; because:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; How can an empty string be a prefix or suffix value?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; as there is no empty string present in a non-empty string.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Note that if case 1 and case 2 would evaluate to “true”,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; it would conflict with case 3.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Can’t imagine that case 3 should in future also result in “true”<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ??<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; -----<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Also I hope that changes to String functionality<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; for Swift 4 are not backward breaking changes<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; even the more for string handling, because Strings<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; are heavily used in most apps.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I am firmly convinced that all future releases of Swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; should compile Swift 3 and higher source files without<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; any changes 100 % flawlessly! This prevents early diminishing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of Swift’s popularity, especially with those building large<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; codebases using Swift.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I’ve started a thread about this a week ago,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; however no one found this important enough to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; share their opinions with me yet, or were too busy with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; other subjects to do so.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Increasingly I have dreams, me<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; programming complete apps in Smalltalk<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and then automagically generate<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; an macOS, tvOS or iOS runtime app of it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (I have also dreams of this world becoming<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a nice and peaceful placebut that is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; beyond the context of this forum)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Kind Regards<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; TedvG<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; www.speyer.de &lt;http://www.speyer.de/&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on Mon Jul 18 2016, Kevin Nattinger &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree, true is definitely the expected behavior.
