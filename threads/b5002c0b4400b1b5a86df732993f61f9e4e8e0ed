That just doesn’t seem write for two reasons:<br>1) “Self&quot; differs from “self” by just the first letter being capitalized. Regardless of case, it is confusing for the terms “self” or “Self” or “SELF” to mean different things from within the same context.<br>2) It makes the code harder to read by having “Self” and “self” mean two different things.<br></p><p>I’d accept the proposal as is, if instead a different term were used, such as “Type”.
