The Swift Evolution process guidelines<br>explicitly tell authors to be responsive to comments during the review<br>period. This naturally lends itself to back-and-forth conversation, and in<br>the past the conversation has (sometimes) resulted in improvements to<br>proposals. I would hate to see that reduced to formal postings only.<br></p><p>Naturally, it is important that all participants maintain a professional<br>approach to debate, but let&#39;s not pretend controversy doesn&#39;t exist in the<br>community when it does. Among other things, it only lends itself to new<br>threads with requests for re-consideration because argument X or Y wasn&#39;t<br>brought up during review.<br></p><p>On Mon, Jul 11, 2016 at 12:47 Jose Cheyo Jimenez via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Hi there,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I have noticed that on the most controversial reviews there has been a<br>&gt; trend of people arguing their specific stance on the proposal beyond the<br>&gt; formal response.
