I know we are not voting here per se but I fail to see how these reviews help the review manager or the community make a decision for or against the proposal; perhaps this could be addressed in a different thread. I just feel that when somebody gives a 0, .5 review, it encourages people to respond to the reviewer in trying to convince them into a side. My recommendation is that people who are not sure should wait for other people to give concrete input to inform a concrete response.<br></p><p>Thanks!<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/60dcb74d816e29b2aa6b9c0b5969670e?s=50"></div><header><strong>[meta] additional input during public reviews</strong> from <string>Xiaodi Wu</string> &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;<p>July 11, 2016 at 06:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>It&#39;d certainly be nice to have more formal reviews, but I would disagree<br>with the rest of your proposal. The Swift Evolution process guidelines<br>explicitly tell authors to be responsive to comments during the review<br>period. This naturally lends itself to back-and-forth conversation, and in<br>the past the conversation has (sometimes) resulted in improvements to<br>proposals. I would hate to see that reduced to formal postings only.<br></p><p>Naturally, it is important that all participants maintain a professional<br>approach to debate, but let&#39;s not pretend controversy doesn&#39;t exist in the<br>community when it does. Among other things, it only lends itself to new<br>threads with requests for re-consideration because argument X or Y wasn&#39;t<br>brought up during review.<br></p><p>On Mon, Jul 11, 2016 at 12:47 Jose Cheyo Jimenez via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Hi there,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I have noticed that on the most controversial reviews there has been a<br>&gt; trend of people arguing their specific stance on the proposal beyond the<br>&gt; formal response.
