Works perfectly with switch keyword:<br></p><p>*switch letter {*<br></p><p>*    //note .r after the string literal of the pattern*<br></p><p>*    case &quot;\\d&quot;.r: print(&quot;digit&quot;)*<br></p><p>*    case &quot;[a-z]&quot;.r: print(&quot;letter&quot;)*<br></p><p>*    default: print(&quot;bizarre symbol&quot;)*<br></p><p>*}*<br></p><p>You can try it in release 0.8 (for Swift 2.x, Swift 3.0 release with this<br>feature is not issued yet).<br></p><p>What we really lack though is matching objects to tuples with *switch*.<br>Here is the explanation:<br></p><p>Let&#39;s say we have a match:<br></p><p>let match = &quot;(\d*)(.*)&quot;.r.findFirst(&quot;123abc&quot;)<br></p><p>what I would love to do with it is the following:<br></p><p>*switch match {*<br></p><p>*case (_, &quot;xyz&quot;): print(&quot;end of alphabet&quot;)*<br></p><p>*case (&quot;123&quot;, _): print(&quot;beginning of numerics&quot;)*<br></p><p>*default: print(&quot;I don&#39;t care&quot;)*<br></p><p>*}*<br></p><p>It would be possible if ~= operator was a bit more powerful and allow to<br>match against tuples (currently, it can&#39;t even without underscores). What I<br>would like to propose (will create an evolution proposal later if it&#39;s<br>something the core-team is willing to consider) is to:<br></p><p>1. Either extend ~= to allow to match tuples. Currently, I see it the<br>following way (an example):<br></p><p>*// you have to create an operator for each tuple size, any ideas on a<br>better solution?*<br></p><p>*func ~=&lt;A, B&gt;(match:Match, tuple:(A?, B?)) -&gt; Bool*<br></p><p>Why optionals? Well, this way we could process _ substitutions.<br></p><p>2. Implement Scala-like apply/unapply. Good too, but option one sounds more<br>&quot;Swiftish&quot; to me personally.<br></p><p><br>Why is this cool? Well, this is not just about Regular Expressions, it&#39;s<br>rather overall language power and Regex is a nice example. I think there<br>will be a lot of examples, especially with the web apps. Some additional<br>ones I can think of right away is processing of URL or query params or<br>&quot;parsing&quot; of message object (i.e. in Actors or Queues).<br></p><p>Why making the match object to be an enum would not work? Well, first of<br>all there is some more additional info in it which I would like to keep<br>hidden for the user (i.e. full match, etc.) and not to push to match to.<br>This is not just one use case and in others it might become even more<br>important.<br></p><p>Hope it&#39;s clear and understandable (let me know if not and I&#39;ll bring it in<br>more details).

Do you mean that the<br>&gt; &gt; stdlib could potentially duplicate Foundation functionality?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; NSRegularExpression is not really easy to use for most common usecases<br>&gt; (first match in string, etc.) + it lacks a lot of features e.g. Python has<br>&gt; (named groups, etc.). I&#39;ve personally never used NSRegularExpression and<br>&gt; rather wrote an ObjC wrapper around re2 (https://github.com/google/re2/).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I&#39;d really like Swift&#39;s regex to be much more powerful and be able to<br>&gt; match against it in a switch:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; switch someString {<br>&gt; case /\d+:<br>&gt;         ...<br>&gt; case /w+:<br>&gt;         ...<br>&gt; ...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Also, you can have compile-time check whether the expression is valid if<br>&gt; regex is part of the language. But that&#39;s kind of getting too specific and<br>&gt; away from the original discussion.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; If so,<br>&gt; &gt; what are the implications for Foundation (and<br>&gt; &gt; swift-corelibs-foundation)? Does this also mean that other &quot;stringy&quot;<br>&gt; &gt; functionality could arrive in the stdlib, for example a Swifty JSON<br>&gt; &gt; serializer/deserializer?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Best wishes,<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; --<br>&gt; &gt; Ian Partridge<br>&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; &gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; &gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160730/0445dac3/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Swift4] Priorities and Sugar</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>July 30, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jul 30, 2016, at 1:42 AM, Ian Partridge &lt;ian at poncho.org.uk&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; On 30 July 2016 at 02:33, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution<br>&gt; &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; I’m personally convinced that we don’t get to great string processing without regular expressions (as one<br>&gt;&gt; example), but they are clearly out of scope for Stage 1.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Foundation already has NSRegularExpression.
