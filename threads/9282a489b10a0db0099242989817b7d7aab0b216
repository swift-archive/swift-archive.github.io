However, I didn&#39;t see anyone putting<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; together a formal proposal, and hence I took the liberty to do<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; so. I would appreciate discussion and comments on the proposal:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I am +1 on the concept of adding regex literals to Swift, but -1 on this proposal.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Specifically, instead of introducing regex literals, I’d suggest<br>&gt;&gt; that you investigate introducing regex’s to the pattern grammar,<br>&gt;&gt; which is what Swift uses for matching already.  Regex’s should be<br>&gt;&gt; usable in the cases of a switch, for example.  Similarly, they<br>&gt;&gt; should be able to bind variables directly to subpatterns.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Further, I highly recommend checking out Perl 6’s regular<br>&gt;&gt; expressions.  They are a community that has had an obsessive passion<br>&gt;&gt; for regular expressions, and in Perl 6 they were given the chance to<br>&gt;&gt; reinvent the wheel based on what they learned.  What they came up<br>&gt;&gt; with is very powerful, and pretty good all around.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Perl 6’s regex implementation looks like a logical progression of the<br>&gt; grep style as we’ve come to know it over the years, but I’d really<br>&gt; like to see Swift go with something like the Verbal Expressions<br>&gt; approach.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; https://github.com/VerbalExpressions/SwiftVerbalExpressions<br>&gt;<br>&gt; All the power is there, but it’s far more readable.<br></p><p>It&#39;s more readable for a first-timer, but IMO not for anyone trying to<br>work with really complex regex&#39;s.  Can you imagine doing math or music<br>this way?  There&#39;s a reason people invent specialized notations.<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
