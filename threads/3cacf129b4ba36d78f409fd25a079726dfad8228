When replying, please try to keep the proposal link at the top of the message:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; What goes into a review?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review through constructive criticism and, eventually, determine the direction of Swift. When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	• What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	• Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	• Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	• If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	• How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -Chris<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Review Manager<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution-announce mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution-announce at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution-announce<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160311/65e70bf6/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d4fb9162c777a5d6d0b1fb00893d709?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0037 Clarify interaction between comments &amp; operators</strong> from <string>Haravikk</string> &lt;swift-evolution at haravikk.me&gt;<p>March 11, 2016 at 07:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; 	• What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>I’m in favour of it; comments shouldn’t conflict with parsing of operators, no matter where someone decides to put them. My preference is towards the “treat comments as absent” alternative however; while I do agree in principle that comments should be placed stupidly, I’m not sure that that’s something we should try to control here. That said, if use of whitespace as proposed would be easier for the compiler either in speed or complexity, then I’m fine with it as a solution too.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>I’d say so; comments shouldn’t be allowed to affect the compiler IMO, yet currently they can.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>Quick read of the proposal, considered the alternatives.<br></p><p><br>Also I’m a -1 to suggestions that /* … */ style comments should be removed; I use these almost exclusively as I can never be 100% sure that a comment won’t need to spill onto more lines, and I hate how multi-line // comments look. I use // for end of line comments though, or for adding // MARK: tags to code sections.<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/05e222e6ef4d84013bb3baeb0e25c90b?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0037 Clarify interaction between comments &amp; operators</strong> from <string>Patrick Gili</string> &lt;gili.patrick.r at gili-labs.com&gt;<p>March 12, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; <br>&gt; 	• What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>I think the alternative to simply ignore comments would be a better direction, especially since the proposal breaks code.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>No.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>No.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>Other languages ignore comments, and hence I think the alternative discussed in the proposal represents a better direction.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• How much effort did you put into your review?

For example, this currently works:<br></p><p>1 /* */+2<br></p><p>(Because the “+” has no whitespace on either side.) If comments were completely ignored, this would be an error since there is whitespace to the left of the “+” but not the right.<br></p><p>If you’re interested in a more complete discussion of this direction, you can see an earlier draft which proposed this in the history &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/c719adf87dae3382319e387fcf3145322a9f1239/proposals/0037-clarify-comments-and-operators.md&gt;.<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; 	• Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; No.<br></p><p>This is admittedly a small issue, so I can understand this point of view. The current state, though, seems pretty surprising to me — comments are treated as non-whitespace in most cases, ignored in others, and the contents of comments can affect the interpretation of the surrounding code.
