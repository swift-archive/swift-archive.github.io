I find this argument very flimsy.<br></p><p>I think the juxtaposition of Array, String, Dictionary, and Set<br>(mutable, with value semantics) and MutableArray, MutableString,<br>MutableDictionary, and MutableSet (mutable, with reference semantics) is<br>one of the most obvious problems with this part of the change.<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
