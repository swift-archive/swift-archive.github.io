Is there some way Apple<br>&gt; could implement this that only affects Swift imports/exports with Obj-C?<br>&gt; Maybe there&#39;s not, but if there is, that seems like a better option.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If Obj-C had never existed, would any sane person ever have suggested that<br>&gt; Swift treat the first parameter differently than the rest? It kinda makes<br>&gt; sense with Obj-C syntax, but it stands out like a sore thumb in Swift.<br></p><p>I disagree with your conclusion, but again, I&#39;m going to hold off<br>further discussion until the review period.  Please bring it up again<br>there and we can have a full exploration of the pros and cons of the<br>current approach.<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
