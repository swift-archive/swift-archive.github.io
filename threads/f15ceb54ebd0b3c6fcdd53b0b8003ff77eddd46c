July 4, 2016. The proposal has been *accepted*:<br></p><p>The community and core team agree that this proposal will lead to a simplification and clarification of the type system, as well as a more clear user model for parameter labels.  In response to community feedback, the core team is accepting the proposal with a revision to allow “purely cosmetic” parameter labels in closure types for documentation (as outlined in the alternatives section).  The core team also wants to clarify that a call to a value of closure type would not allow use of any parameter labels, some interpretations thought that “arbitrary” parameter labels could be used.<br></p><p>Thank you to Austin Zheng for driving this discussion forward!  I filed SR-2009 to track implementation work on this.<br></p><p>-Chris Lattner<br>Review Manager<br></p><p>_______________________________________________<br>swift-evolution mailing list<br>swift-evolution at swift.org<br>https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p><br></p><p>_______________________________________________<br>swift-evolution mailing list<br>swift-evolution at swift.org<br>https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>_______________________________________________<br>swift-evolution mailing list<br>swift-evolution at swift.org<br>https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p><br></p><p>_______________________________________________<br>swift-evolution mailing list<br>swift-evolution at swift.org<br>https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160708/f15cd46c/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
