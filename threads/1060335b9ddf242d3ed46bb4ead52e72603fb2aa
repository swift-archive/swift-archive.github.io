It&#39;s basically `with(_:update:)`, but as a method and not `inout`, which usually doesn&#39;t matter for Ruby since everything is an object in that language. Typically, though, `tap` is not used to mutate at all; instead, it&#39;s used to access an intermediate value in a method chain, for instance to log it.<br></p><p>I am very much in favor of `with(_:update:)`. Fundamentally, it is an operation which applies a mutating method to a copy to make it nonmutating; this seems like a very useful thing to have in the standard library. I could easily imagine the standard library itself using it to reduce boilerplate. For instance, if the FloatingPoint protocol currently offers this:<br></p><p>	extension FloatingPoint {<br>		func adding(_ other: Self) -&gt; Self {<br>			var selfCopy = self<br>			selfCopy.add(other)<br>			return selfCopy<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>`with(_:update:)` would allow us to instead shorten it to:<br></p><p>	extension FloatingPoint {<br>		func adding(_ other: Self) -&gt; Self {<br>			return with(self) { $0.add(other) }<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>I also think this is fairly future-proof. Many of the future proposals in this area, like `self` shadowing, will interoperate with `with(_:update:)` perfectly. Others, like method cascading, would supplant it in some uses, but still leave many others (like the `FloatingPoint` example above) untouched. But even without any other changes at all, this is a good, useful thing to have in the language.<br></p><p>I don&#39;t agree with those who argue that this should be a method. When Swift offers an operation on any instance, it very rarely does so as a member (and `dynamicType`, one of the few exceptions, seems to be going away); instead, it uses either a free function or an initializer on the result type, depending on the circumstance. A `with(_:update:)` free function thus matches a broader pattern in the language.<br></p><p>There are also implementation reasons not to go the method route. A free function can be trivially implemented in the standard library with no language changes at all. A method, on the other hand, would either have to be implemented as a keyword specially recognized by the parser and handled by the language (as `dynamicType` is), or would require us to allow the currently forbidden extension of `Any`. Either of these is vastly more difficult and risky than using a free function.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e9f543f0ffdb7c9a899e628fe76e7f3?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Circling back to `with`</strong> from <string>Jacob Bandes-Storch</string> &lt;jtbandes at gmail.com&gt;<p>May 25, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>I like this pretty well, and I think &quot;with()&quot; makes sense as a peer of<br>&quot;withUnsafePointer()&quot;, &quot;withExtendedLifetime()&quot;, etc.<br></p><p>I&#39;d also be okay with waiting for a comprehensive method-cascading<br>solution.

Numerous variations on the theme have been introduced on the Swift Evolution list and in third party github repositories.

When duplicating and modifying a constant, the closure must create a var copy and modify that copy.<br>&gt; While the implementation is imperfect, the wins are notable. Code naturally groups into a clear set-up sequence. The scoped setup avoids clumpy redundant lines where the same variable is accessed over and over. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; let questionLabel = UILabel()<br>&gt; questionLabel.textAlignment = .Center<br>&gt; questionLabel.font =  UIFont(name:&quot;DnealianManuscript&quot;, size: 72)<br>&gt; questionLabel.text = questionText<br>&gt; questionLabel.numberOfLines = 0<br>&gt; In the case of non-reference types, a constant&#39;s fields may be set-up sequentially without forcing the constant to be a variable.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/96d9c5bb4eaa3ed3b2ff82dc35aa8dae#detailed-design&gt;Detailed Design<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This proposal introduces a with function that enables modification and use of an instance using positional references.

The most obvious: if the primary reason for `with` to exist post-method cascading is to introduce a copy, I would prefer a `copy` function that could be used in conjunction with method cascading (which would then mutate and return the copy rather than the initial instance).<br></p><p>Brent’s example would go from:<br></p><p>	extension FloatingPoint {<br>		func adding(_ other: Self) -&gt; Self {<br>			return with(self) { $0.add(other) }<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>to: <br></p><p>	extension FloatingPoint {<br>		func adding(_ other: Self) -&gt; Self {<br>			return copy(self)..add(other)<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>This reads much better than the former IMO.<br></p><p>I’m interested in hearing about use cases where `with` is superior to method cascading plus `copy`.

For example, they may initialize and customize a Cocoa object:<br></p><p>let questionLabel: UILabel = {<br>    $0.textAlignment = .Center<br>    $0.font = UIFont(name: &quot;DnealianManuscript&quot;, size: 72)<br>    $0.text = questionText<br>    $0.numberOfLines = 0<br>    mainView.addSubview($0)<br>    return $0<br>}(UILabel())<br>Or they may duplicate and modify a constant value-typed instance:<br></p><p>let john = Person(name: &quot;John&quot;, favoriteColor: .blueColor())<br>let jane: Person = { (var copy) in<br>    copy.name = &quot;Jane&quot;<br>    return copy<br>}(john)<br>This technique has many drawbacks:<br></p><p>The compiler cannot infer the return type.<br>You must explicitly return the modified instance.<br>The instance being used comes after, not before, the code using it.<br>Nevertheless, developers have created many variations on this theme, because they are drawn to its benefits:<br></p><p>The short, temporary name reduces noise compared to repeating a variable name like questionLabel.<br>The block groups together the initialization code.<br>The scope of mutability is limited.<br>SE-0003, which removes var parameters &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0003-remove-var-parameters.md&gt;, will make this situation even worse by requiring a second line of boilerplate for value types. And yet developers will probably keep using these sorts of tricks.<br></p><p>Fundamentally, this is a very simple and common pattern: creating a temporary mutable variable confined to a short scope, whose value will later be used immutably in a wider scope. Moreover, this pattern shortens the scopes of mutable variables, so it is something we should encourage. We believe it&#39;s worth codifying in the standard library.<br></p><p> &lt;https://gist.github.com/brentdax/ce3272e3d35f5ccac56483666f86b8fb#proposed-solution&gt;Proposed Solution<br></p><p>We propose introducing a function with the following simplified signature:<br></p><p>func with&lt;T&gt;(_: T, update: (inout T -&gt; Void)) -&gt; T<br>with assigns the value to a new variable, passes that variable as a parameter to the closure, and then returns the potentially modified variable. That means:<br></p><p>When used with value types, the closure can modify a copy of the original value.<br>When used with reference types, the closure can substitute a different instance for the original, perhaps by calling copy() or some non-Cocoa equivalent.<br>The closure does not actually have to modify the parameter; it can merely use it, or (for a reference type) modify the object without changing the reference.<br></p><p> &lt;https://gist.github.com/brentdax/ce3272e3d35f5ccac56483666f86b8fb#examples&gt;Examples<br></p><p> &lt;https://gist.github.com/brentdax/ce3272e3d35f5ccac56483666f86b8fb#initializing-a-cocoa-object&gt;Initializing a Cocoa Object<br></p><p>Before:<br></p><p>let questionLabel: UILabel = {<br>    $0.textAlignment = .Center<br>    $0.font = UIFont(name: &quot;DnealianManuscript&quot;, size: 72)<br>    $0.text = questionText<br>    $0.numberOfLines = 0<br>    mainView.addSubview($0)<br>    return $0<br>}(UILabel())<br>After:<br></p><p>let questionLabel = with(UILabel()) {<br>    $0.textAlignment = .Center<br>    $0.font = UIFont(name: &quot;DnealianManuscript&quot;, size: 72)<br>    $0.text = questionText<br>    $0.numberOfLines = 0<br>    mainView.addSubview($0)<br>}<br>Using with here moves the UILabel() initialization to the top, allows the type of questionLabel to be inferred, and removes the return statement.<br></p><p> &lt;https://gist.github.com/brentdax/ce3272e3d35f5ccac56483666f86b8fb#copying-and-modifying-a-constant&gt;Copying and Modifying a Constant<br></p><p>Before (without var parameter):<br></p><p>let john = Person(name: &quot;John&quot;, favoriteColor: .blueColor())<br>let jane: Person = {<br>    var copy = $0<br>    copy.name = &quot;Jane&quot;<br>    return copy<br>}(john)<br>After:<br></p><p>let john = Person(name: &quot;John&quot;, favoriteColor: .blueColor())<br>let jane = with(john) {<br>    $0.name = &quot;Jane&quot;<br>}<br>In addition to the aforementioned benefits, with removes the var copy line.<br></p><p> &lt;https://gist.github.com/brentdax/ce3272e3d35f5ccac56483666f86b8fb#treating-a-mutable-method-as-a-copy-and-return-method&gt;Treating a Mutable Method As a Copy-and-Return Method<br></p><p>You would like to write this:<br></p><p>let fewerFoos = foos.removing(at: i)<br>But there is only a remove(at:) mutating method.

If rejected, users could continue to write code using the longhand form, the various closure-based techniques, or homegrown versions of with.<br></p><p>Using method syntax: Some list members preferred a syntax that looked more like a method call with a trailing closure:<br></p><p>let questionLabel = UILabel().with {<br>    $0.textAlignment = .Center<br>    $0.font = UIFont(name: &quot;DnealianManuscript&quot;, size: 72)<br>    $0.numberOfLines = 0<br>    addSubview($0)<br>}<br>This would require a more drastic solution as it&#39;s not possible to add methods to all Swift types.

Normally, the compiler would reject that.<br></p><p>Perhaps you could say that method cascades operate on a copy if the receiver is immutable, but that makes code vague and its behavior subtle and easily changed by accident. For instance, if a property is `internal private(set)`, then moving a method cascade from code which can&#39;t see the setter to code which can would silently change the code from immutable to mutable. Similarly, adding the `private(set)` would not cause the code which previously modified it to produce an error; it would instead silently change to no longer mutate where it used to before.

The language rules for method cascades could be defined such that they create a contextual type environment that allows the return value temporary to be mutable to allow the method cascade to operate on the temporary in place before it is used in the surrounding expression.  This makes sense for method cascades because by definition they return the original value.  It does not make sense for arbitrary operations because they will not return the original value.<br></p><p>Applying mutating method cascades to temporary value could be very handy.  You have an expression that returns a value and mutate the result before storing it in a binding or returning it from your function.  You can do this by binding the result to an explicit temporary and giving it a name.  Allowing you to do it with method cascades on the implicit temporary is great syntactic sugar and a big argument for making them work well with value types, not just reference types IMO.<br></p><p><br>&gt; Will this distinction hold up when we get `inout`-returning functions?<br></p><p>What I describe above would mean return values behave like a `var` argument used to (before they were removed) when the return value has a method cascade attached to it.  `inout` return values would work differently, writing back to the source storage.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; Basically, what principled rule makes Swift treat this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	immutableVariable..mutatingMethod()<br>&gt; <br>&gt; And this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	functionCall()..mutatingMethod()<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Differently?<br></p><p>The rule is that it is safe to mutate a return value temporary copy in place without impacting the semantics of any code that relies on immutability.  The mutation happens prior to any code getting a chance to do anything with the value.  The mutation is really part of the expression itself and the method cascade provides a safe syntactic and semantic environment for allowing this mutation.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; Or is the distinction between this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	immutableVariable..mutatingMethod()<br>&gt; <br>&gt; And this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	mutableVariable..mutatingMethod()<br>&gt; <br>&gt; And if so, how is that not going to lead to bugs when people move code around?<br></p><p>That distinction is absolutely critical.  The former is not allowed.  I am not suggesting allowing calling mutating methods on any `let` constants.

This function simplifies the initialization of objects and modification of value types.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Swift-evolution thread: What about a VBA style with Statement?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Motivation<br>&gt; <br>&gt; When setting up or modifying an instance, developers sometimes use an immediately-called closure to introduce a short alias for the instance and group the modification code together. For example, they may initialize and customize a Cocoa object:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let questionLabel: UILabel = {<br>&gt;     $0.textAlignment = .Center<br>&gt;     $0.font = UIFont(name: &quot;DnealianManuscript&quot;, size: 72)<br>&gt;     $0.text = questionText<br>&gt;     $0.numberOfLines = 0<br>&gt;     mainView.addSubview($0)<br>&gt;     return $0<br>&gt; }(UILabel())<br>&gt; Or they may duplicate and modify a constant value-typed instance:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let john = Person(name: &quot;John&quot;, favoriteColor: .blueColor())<br>&gt; let jane: Person = { (var copy) in<br>&gt;     copy.name = &quot;Jane&quot;<br>&gt;     return copy<br>&gt; }(john)<br>&gt; This technique has many drawbacks:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The compiler cannot infer the return type.<br>&gt; You must explicitly return the modified instance.<br>&gt; The instance being used comes after, not before, the code using it.<br>&gt; Nevertheless, developers have created many variations on this theme, because they are drawn to its benefits:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The short, temporary name reduces noise compared to repeating a variable name like questionLabel.<br>&gt; The block groups together the initialization code.<br>&gt; The scope of mutability is limited.<br>&gt; SE-0003, which removes var parameters, will make this situation even worse by requiring a second line of boilerplate for value types. And yet developers will probably keep using these sorts of tricks.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Fundamentally, this is a very simple and common pattern: creating a temporary mutable variable confined to a short scope, whose value will later be used immutably in a wider scope. Moreover, this pattern shortens the scopes of mutable variables, so it is something we should encourage. We believe it&#39;s worth codifying in the standard library.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Proposed Solution<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We propose introducing a function with the following simplified signature:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; func with&lt;T&gt;(_: T, update: (inout T -&gt; Void)) -&gt; T<br>&gt; with assigns the value to a new variable, passes that variable as a parameter to the closure, and then returns the potentially modified variable. That means:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; When used with value types, the closure can modify a copy of the original value.<br>&gt; When used with reference types, the closure can substitute a different instance for the original, perhaps by calling copy() or some non-Cocoa equivalent.<br>&gt; The closure does not actually have to modify the parameter; it can merely use it, or (for a reference type) modify the object without changing the reference.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Examples<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Initializing a Cocoa Object<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Before:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let questionLabel: UILabel = {<br>&gt;     $0.textAlignment = .Center<br>&gt;     $0.font = UIFont(name: &quot;DnealianManuscript&quot;, size: 72)<br>&gt;     $0.text = questionText<br>&gt;     $0.numberOfLines = 0<br>&gt;     mainView.addSubview($0)<br>&gt;     return $0<br>&gt; }(UILabel())<br>&gt; After:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let questionLabel = with(UILabel()) {<br>&gt;     $0.textAlignment = .Center<br>&gt;     $0.font = UIFont(name: &quot;DnealianManuscript&quot;, size: 72)<br>&gt;     $0.text = questionText<br>&gt;     $0.numberOfLines = 0<br>&gt;     mainView.addSubview($0)<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; Using with here moves the UILabel() initialization to the top, allows the type of questionLabel to be inferred, and removes the return statement.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Copying and Modifying a Constant<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Before (without var parameter):<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let john = Person(name: &quot;John&quot;, favoriteColor: .blueColor())<br>&gt; let jane: Person = {<br>&gt;     var copy = $0<br>&gt;     copy.name = &quot;Jane&quot;<br>&gt;     return copy<br>&gt; }(john)<br>&gt; After:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let john = Person(name: &quot;John&quot;, favoriteColor: .blueColor())<br>&gt; let jane = with(john) {<br>&gt;     $0.name = &quot;Jane&quot;<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; In addition to the aforementioned benefits, with removes the var copy line.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Treating a Mutable Method As a Copy-and-Return Method<br>&gt; <br>&gt; You would like to write this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let fewerFoos = foos.removing(at: i)<br>&gt; But there is only a remove(at:) mutating method. Using with, you can write:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let fewerFoos = with(foos) { $0.remove(at: i) }<br>&gt; Avoiding Mutable Shadowing<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The standard library includes an operator for concatenating two RangeReplaceableCollections with this implementation:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; var lhs = lhs<br>&gt; // FIXME: what if lhs is a reference type?  This will mutate it.<br>&gt; lhs.reserveCapacity(lhs.count + numericCast(rhs.count))<br>&gt; lhs.append(contentsOf: rhs)<br>&gt; return lhs<br>&gt; Using with, you can eliminate the shadowing of lhs:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; // FIXME: what if lhs is a reference type?  This will mutate it.<br>&gt; return with(lhs) {<br>&gt;   $0.reserveCapacity($0.count + numericCast(rhs.count))<br>&gt;   $0.append(contentsOf: rhs)<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; It&#39;s important to note that with does not resolve the &quot;FIXME&quot; comment. Like the var lhs = lhs in the original code, with only copies value types, not reference types. If RangeReplaceableCollection included a Foundation-like copy()method that was guaranteed to return a copy even if it was a reference type, with would work nicely with that solution:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; return with(lhs.copy()) {<br>&gt;   $0.reserveCapacity($0.count + numericCast(rhs.count))<br>&gt;   $0.append(contentsOf: rhs)<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; Inspecting an Intermediate Value<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Suppose you want to inspect a value in the middle of a long method chain. For instance, you&#39;re not sure this is retrieving the type of cell you expect:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let view = tableView.cellForRow(at: indexPath)?.contentView.withTag(42)<br>&gt; Currently, you would need to either split the statement in two so you could capture the return value of cellForRow(at:) in a constant, or insert a very clunky immediate-closure call in the middle of the statement. Using with, you can stay close to the original expression:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let view = with(tableView.cellForRow(at: indexPath)) { print($0) }?.contentView.withTag(42)<br>&gt; Because the closure doesn&#39;t alter $0, the cell passes through the with call unaltered, so it can be used by the rest of the method chain.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Detailed Design<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We propose adding the following free function to the standard library:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; /// Returns `item` after calling `update` to inspect and possibly <br>&gt; /// modify it.<br>&gt; /// <br>&gt; /// If `T` is a value type, `update` uses an independent copy <br>&gt; /// of `item`. If `T` is a reference type, `update` uses the <br>&gt; /// same instance passed in, but it can substitute a different <br>&gt; /// instance by setting its parameter to a new value.<br>&gt; @discardableResult<br>&gt; public func with&lt;T&gt;(_ item: T, update: @noescape (inout T) throws -&gt; Void) rethrows -&gt; T {<br>&gt;   var this = item<br>&gt;   try update(&amp;this)<br>&gt;   return this<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; @discardableResult permits the use of with(_:update:) to create a scoped temporary copy of the value with a shorter name.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Impact on Existing Code<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This proposal is purely additive and has no impact on existing code.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Alternatives Considered<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Doing nothing: with is a mere convenience; any code using it could be written another way. If rejected, users could continue to write code using the longhand form, the various closure-based techniques, or homegrown versions of with.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Using method syntax: Some list members preferred a syntax that looked more like a method call with a trailing closure:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let questionLabel = UILabel().with {<br>&gt;     $0.textAlignment = .Center<br>&gt;     $0.font = UIFont(name: &quot;DnealianManuscript&quot;, size: 72)<br>&gt;     $0.numberOfLines = 0<br>&gt;     addSubview($0)<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; This would require a more drastic solution as it&#39;s not possible to add methods to all Swift types. Nor does it match the existing design of functions like withExtendedLifetime(_:_:), withUnsafePointer(_:_:), and reflect(_:).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Adding self rebinding: Some list members wanted a way to bind self to the passed argument, so that they can use implicit self to eliminate $0.:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let supView = self<br>&gt; let questionLabel = with(UILabel()) { <br>&gt;     self in<br>&gt;     textAlignment = .Center<br>&gt;     font = UIFont(name: &quot;DnealianManuscript&quot;, size: 72)<br>&gt;     numberOfLines = 0<br>&gt;     supView.addSubview(self)<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; We do not believe this is practical to propose in the Swift 3 timeframe, and we believe with would work well with this feature if it were added later.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Adding method cascades: A competing proposal was to introduce a way to use several methods or properties on the same instance; Dart and Smalltalk have features of this kind.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let questionLabel = UILabel()<br>&gt;     ..textAlignment = .Center<br>&gt;     ..font = UIFont(name: &quot;DnealianManuscript&quot;, size: 72)<br>&gt;     ..numberOfLines = 0<br>&gt; addSubview(questionLabel)<br>&gt; Like rebinding self, we do not believe method cascades are practical for the Swift 3 timeframe. We also believe that many of with&#39;s use cases would not be subsumed by method cascades even if they were added.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160527/53541636/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
