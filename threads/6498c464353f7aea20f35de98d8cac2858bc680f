There are now over 30 <br>people signed up in addition to the steering team, and some health <br>discussion has started on the mailing list.<br></p><p>One question that&#39;s been raised more than once is: Ok, there&#39;s a project <br>page and a work group, but what happens next?<br></p><p>The Server APIs Project pages outlined three initial focus areas: Base <br>Networking, Security and Encryption, and HTTP and WebSockets. For each of <br>these areas we&#39;ll be forming a sub-team whose initial task is to building <br>a Swift Evolution &quot;Pitch&quot;. This means collating requirements from the <br>community around function, capability, and usage models, alongside <br>evaluating available technologies like C libraries that could be used to <br>help implement low level function, or existing Swift packages that ideas <br>could be borrowed from, to form a high level sketch of the capabilities <br>that the APIs would implement and an overview of how they would be <br>implemented. Based on feedback from the community, the iterative process <br>of prototyping and development can then begin. The Development Process is <br>documented in more detail on the Server APIs Project page on Swift.org.<br></p><p>Over the next few days we&#39;ll start to schedule kick-off meetings for each <br>of the sub-teams. We&#39;ll be using Doodle polls to try to schedule a time <br>that works for most participants. Obviously what ever day/time it ends up <br>being, there will be some people that cannot make it - don&#39;t worry though, <br>we&#39;ll be publishing the agenda (along with a request for agenda items) and <br>a full set of minutes on GitHub. <br></p><p><br>Chris<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-server-dev/attachments/20161101/6498680f/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
