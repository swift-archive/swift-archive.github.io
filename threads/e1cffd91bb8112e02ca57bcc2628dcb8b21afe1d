All reviews should be sent to the swift-evolution mailing list at:<br></p><p>https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>or, if you would like to keep your feedback private, directly to the review manager.<br></p><p>What goes into a review?<br></p><p>The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review through constructive criticism and, eventually, determine the direction of Swift. When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br></p><p>	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to the Swift Package Manager?<br>	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of the Swift Package Manager?<br>	* If you have you used other package managers with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br></p><p>	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br></p><p>Thank you,<br></p><p>Anders<br>Review Manager<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/05540cd6be96706f76aa66a4519f7db9?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution] [Review] SE-0063: SwiftPM System Module Search Paths</strong> from <string>Ankit Agarwal</string> &lt;ankit at ankit.im&gt;<p>April  8, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt;         * What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt;<br></p><p>I am in favour of this proposal.

A lot of users have reported bugs in jira about this.<br></p><p><br>&gt;         * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of the<br>&gt; Swift Package Manager?<br>&gt;<br></p><p>Yes, it will improve the functionality of swiftpm<br></p><p><br>&gt;         * How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick<br>&gt; reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt;<br></p><p>I implemented the first draft of proposal and tried using GTK3 library on<br>OSX and Ubuntu, It works out really nice.

When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>I think it is a good direction.<br></p><p>I think we inevitably will need to interface more with system package managers in order to do a great job of being seamless and working out of the box, and while the addition of &quot;providers&quot; to the Package.swift is going to have a maintenance cost, it seems sensible to go ahead and start building out this support.
