From what I can tell, it is not currently possible to override it based on the source code itself. In the pbxproj().swift &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Sources/Xcodeproj/pbxproj().swift#L73-L78&gt; file, the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is hardcoded to 10.10 with a FIXME saying it needs to be configurable.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If this currently cannot be overridden, then I’d like to file a feature request so we can build Alamofire 4.0.0 with the SPM. If it can be overridden, I’d really appreciate someone letting me know how.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance!<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-users mailing list<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-users at swift.org<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-users<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; swift-users mailing list<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; swift-users at swift.org<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-users<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-users mailing list<br>&gt; swift-users at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-users<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
