I believe supporting public inheritance is the single most <br>complicated thing in modern API design; thus, allowing inheritance to <br>happen without explicit approval of the API designer is clearly a bad <br>idea.<br></p><p>I&#39;m OK with the proposed keywords (subclassable/overridable), but I <br>like &quot;open&quot; even more.<br>I think &quot;base class&quot;/&quot;base func&quot; or &quot;super class&quot;/&quot;super func&quot; would <br>also read well.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a <br>&gt; change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. This proposal helps third-party API writers avoid a major source <br>of pitfalls.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Absolutely. Having sensible/safe defaults for such toggles feels like a <br>major feature in Swift.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar <br>&gt; feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>Java is a huge poster child for object oriented programming, which is <br>often misunderstood to be primarily about inheritance. Still, <br>collections of Java best practices invariably include strongly worded <br>advice for preferring composition over inheritance, and I especially <br>like the following rule:<br></p><p>	Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it.<br>			-- Joshua Bloch: Effective Java. Addison-Wesley, 2001.<br></p><p>Even in Java, it is a bad idea to leave classes subclassable; but <br>having to remember to add final is a chore.<br></p><p>SE-0117 takes this a step further by allowing package writers to use <br>inheritance internally when it makes sense, without also having to take <br>on the complications arising from allowing third-party inheritance -- <br>such as having to write a reasonably complete unit test suite for <br>superclass-subclass interactions. This is an interesting improvement <br>over final-by-default (which I&#39;d also support).<br></p><p>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick <br>&gt; reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>I carefully read it, drank a cup of my favorite beverage to celebrate <br>its existence, then I collected my thoughts.<br></p><p>--<br>Karoly<br>@lorentey<br></p><p><br>On 2016-07-05 23:11:17 +0000, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution said:<br></p><p>&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The review of &quot;SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable <br>&gt; publicly&quot; begins now and runs through July 11.

As others have noted, this pressure already exists in the form of value types, protocol-oriented designs, etc - the current proposal is a relatively modest increase in that pressure.

I expect a fairly rich environment of libraries that will sort itself out over time.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Shawn<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Sat, Jul 9, 2016 at 8:43 AM Andre via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, you *do not* want any new subclasses added as you know that is not likely to end well.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Im curious, what kind of real-world scenario would &quot;not end well&quot; cover?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I’m genuinely curious, since Im still on the fence about this, but am willing to be convinced… if sealed by default brings more positives than negatives…<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Andre<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 2016/07/09 21:36、Matthew Johnson via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; のメール：<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent from my iPad<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; On Jul 9, 2016, at 3:48 AM, Goffredo Marocchi via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent from my iPhone<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; On 8 Jul 2016, at 15:09, Károly Lőrentey via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Even in Java, it is a bad idea to leave classes subclassable; but having to remember to add final is a chore.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I still think it is worth doing that chore. The fact of the matter is that Java did not and is not enforcing that default and how many widely used production languages you know that do enforce this by default instead of asking library authors to do this bit of work?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; People keep talking about just adding final.  This *is not* an alternative.  We are not talking about preventing subclasses by default (i.e. final by default).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; We are talking about preventing subclasses *in other modules* by default (i.e. sealed by default).  The alternative would be to introduce a sealed keyword (or similar).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; There are times when you *need* to use subclasses inside your module.  Some or all of them may not even be directly visible externally (class clusters).  However, you *do not* want any new subclasses added as you know that is not likely to end well.  This is why having sealed, not just final, is important.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; By choosing sealed as a default rather than final, we are keeping the &quot;subclassable by default&quot; status *within* modules.  This facilitates experimentation and eliminates the need for application level code to opt-in to subclassing while still making external API contracts explicit and therefore hopefully more robust.  It is the default most in-line with the values and goals of Swift.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &#39;final&#39; and &#39;sealed&#39; are two very different things.

Some things to consider:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 1. This proposal should not impact any existing libraries - nobody should be shipping closed-source binary libraries written in Swift yet.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 2. Apple’s frameworks will probably remain in Objective-C for some time to come.  If / when they are replaced with Swift frameworks the default will have little (if any) impact on the public API contract.  It is reasonable to expect that Apple will review the public contracts carefully and add any annotations necessary to achieve the desired semantics.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 3. In the future, if you depend on any 3rd party closed-source libraries written in Swift you will be able to ship an update to your app that contains an updated / fixed version of the library independent of the user upgrading their OS.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I see, makes sense and I get a better idea where this is going… its how I feel as well...<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; This leaves the scenario of a case where you depend on a 3rd party, closed-source library written in Swift and where you cannot get (or use) a fix from the vendor for some reason.

As others have noted, this pressure already exists in the form of value types, protocol-oriented designs, etc - the current proposal is a relatively modest increase in that pressure.

Some things to consider:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. This proposal should not impact any existing libraries - nobody should be shipping closed-source binary libraries written in Swift yet.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Apple’s frameworks will probably remain in Objective-C for some time to come.  If / when they are replaced with Swift frameworks the default will have little (if any) impact on the public API contract.  It is reasonable to expect that Apple will review the public contracts carefully and add any annotations necessary to achieve the desired semantics.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. In the future, if you depend on any 3rd party closed-source libraries written in Swift you will be able to ship an update to your app that contains an updated / fixed version of the library independent of the user upgrading their OS.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This leaves the scenario of a case where you depend on a 3rd party, closed-source library written in Swift and where you cannot get (or use) a fix from the vendor for some reason.  This is a legitimate concern, but IMO it is not large enough to outweigh all of the advantages of making sealed the default.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no doubt that adopting sealed by default will place some pressure on the Swift ecosystem.  As others have noted, this pressure already exists in the form of value types, protocol-oriented designs, etc - the current proposal is a relatively modest increase in that pressure.   I believe the pressure will have a very positive impact over time (the eventual outcome remains to be seen of course).  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift library vendors will need to choose between opening their source, providing responsive support and bug fixes, explicitly providing the escape hatch you mention (by designing with open types) or getting a bad reputation among users.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; There are IMO no advantages to sealing by default. If there were, I cannot imagine how they can have so consistently eluded the designers and maintainers of so many great OOD languages in the last 30 years. Does it mean it is just a matter of time for the core team to take it the c++ standardization committee to make sure C++ gets enhanced the same way?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; You can’t compare Swift to C++ here. C++ uses « final » method and static dispatch by default, so subclassing does not imply the same fragility than with a fully dynamic language.<br></p><p>... and whole module optimization does final inferrance on anything internal... so how much more training wheels do we need to write decent code?  After 30 years of Objc&#39;s msg dispatching being touted as not a performance problem, all we hear for the last couple WWDC (did you pay attention to the &#39;they are getting it&#39; during one of the session) is how much every single dynamic dispatch must be chased out of our systems, culminating with this &#39;seal by default is best for you&#39;.  Why can&#39;t developers writting code be made responsible for writing well or not?<br></p><p><br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -Matthew<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Andre<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2016/07/09 22:11、Shawn Erickson &lt;shawnce at gmail.com&gt; のメール：<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What I don&#39;t get in the arguments against this capability is the fact that many constructs in Swift can&#39;t be subclassed. Are we going to prevent library developers from presenting those in the public API? Your ability to subclass things when not supported by the library developer is already going to be greatly reduced. Additionally you are going to miss potentially helpful optimization in side the model if the library developer can&#39;t prevent extras subclassing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems perfectly reasonable to allow a lot of freedoms for a library developer when designing their code on their side of the library API and not force them to expose unwanted API just because of internal design desires. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (I have myself have already struggled with having to leak what I consider internal details outside of modules we have developed internally, likely need to get around to outlining the additional issues I see)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the end if the library isn&#39;t good and you don&#39;t like the API find one that works the way you need (or make one). I expect a fairly rich environment of libraries that will sort itself out over time.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Shawn<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Sat, Jul 9, 2016 at 8:43 AM Andre via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, you *do not* want any new subclasses added as you know that is not likely to end well.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Im curious, what kind of real-world scenario would &quot;not end well&quot; cover?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I’m genuinely curious, since Im still on the fence about this, but am willing to be convinced… if sealed by default brings more positives than negatives…<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Andre<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 2016/07/09 21:36、Matthew Johnson via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; のメール：<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent from my iPad<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; On Jul 9, 2016, at 3:48 AM, Goffredo Marocchi via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent from my iPhone<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; On 8 Jul 2016, at 15:09, Károly Lőrentey via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Even in Java, it is a bad idea to leave classes subclassable; but having to remember to add final is a chore.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I still think it is worth doing that chore.

The fact of the matter is that Java did not and is not enforcing that default and how many widely used production languages you know that do enforce this by default instead of asking library authors to do this bit of work?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; People keep talking about just adding final.  This *is not* an alternative.  We are not talking about preventing subclasses by default (i.e. final by default).  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; We are talking about preventing subclasses *in other modules* by default (i.e. sealed by default).  The alternative would be to introduce a sealed keyword (or similar).<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; There are times when you *need* to use subclasses inside your module.  Some or all of them may not even be directly visible externally (class clusters).  However, you *do not* want any new subclasses added as you know that is not likely to end well.  This is why having sealed, not just final, is important.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; By choosing sealed as a default rather than final, we are keeping the &quot;subclassable by default&quot; status *within* modules.  This facilitates experimentation and eliminates the need for application level code to opt-in to subclassing while still making external API contracts explicit and therefore hopefully more robust.  It is the default most in-line with the values and goals of Swift.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; &#39;final&#39; and &#39;sealed&#39; are two very different things.

Adding/reordering/removing calls to overridable methods can (and, if your package is popular and/or unlucky enough, will) break your clients.<br></p><p>Trying to write unit tests to verify a subclassing interface is an exercise in frustration; but unless you have adequate coverage, you can&#39;t really expect package maintainers not to accidentally break the subclassing contract in any future release.<br></p><p>Subclassing is an important tool in Swift&#39;s toolbox, but it takes considerable effort to prepare a class for inheritance. It is not OK to just slap on an &quot;open&quot; keyword and call it done; and it is unsafe to let it happen purely by accident.<br></p><p>Karoly<br>@lorentey<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
