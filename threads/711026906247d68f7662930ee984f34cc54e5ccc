The Swift Guidelines say that mutating functions should use a verb, and non-mutating forms should use a noun, but in this case, the word union itself is a verb and a noun.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Have we considered this, then:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; a.union(b) //mutating<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; _ = a.union(b) //non-mutating<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; There is no ambiguity in most situations, and the fact the Swift compiler can&#39;t disambiguate this at the moment is a bug I&#39;d like to see fixed in the Swift 3 timeframe. I think this wouldn&#39;t be such a bad compromise, and other functions could still use the standard -ed/-ing system alongside this without the API looking inconsistent, unlike with the form- prefix.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Admittedly, there is merit to the idea that functional methods should make non-mutating forms the primary form, but I feel like we should figure out what our stance is on this methodology in general. A mention in the Guidelines one way or the other would be nice, since the current rules seem to support this.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From James F<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Can’t we do this for every mutating method? i.e.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; var numbers = [1,3,2]<br>&gt; &gt; let sorted = numbers.sort()<br>&gt; &gt; // sorted is [1,2,3], numbers is [1,3,2]<br>&gt; &gt; numbers.sort()<br>&gt; &gt; // numbers is [1,2,3]<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; I suppose this would require that the mutating version doesn’t return anything, and I don’t know if that’s ever a problem.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br></p><p>Well, this change would render a big part of the naming guidelines meaningless, but isn’t that a good thing?
