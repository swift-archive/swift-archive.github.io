That said, I&#39;m going to put on my<br>&gt;         painters cap to consider selecting some exterior latex for the feature I<br>&gt;         was most looking forward to in this proposal:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         Core team writes:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;             unfold(_:applying:) - This addition is *rejected* by the core team<br>&gt;             as written, but deserves more discussion in the community, and<br>&gt;             potentially could be the subject of a future proposal. The core team<br>&gt;             felt that the utility of this operation is high enough to be worth<br>&gt;             including in the standard library, but could not find an acceptable<br>&gt;             name for it. “unfold” is problematic, despite its precedence in<br>&gt;             other language, because Swift calls the corresponding operation<br>&gt;             “reduce” and not “fold”. No one could get excited about “unreduce”.<br>&gt;             “iterate” was also considered, but a noun is more appropriate than<br>&gt;             an verb in this case. Given the lack of a good name, the core team<br>&gt;             preferred to reject to let the community discuss it more.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         A few thoughts:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         * I&#39;m not sure why a noun is more appropriate than a verb. Reduce isn&#39;t<br>&gt;         a noun, prefix isn&#39;t a noun, drop isn&#39;t a noun. <br>&gt;<br>&gt;     I’m not a naming guru, but my understanding is that ‘reduce’ was picked<br>&gt;     because it was term of art (like map), which is what allowed the misuse of a<br>&gt;     verb.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     One idea that came out of the core team discussion was something like:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     sequence(from: 0) { $0 += 42 }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     Since it returns a sequence.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     -Chris<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     _______________________________________________<br>&gt;     swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;     swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;     https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
