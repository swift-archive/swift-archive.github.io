I hope you don’t mind Rudolf, but I used your example to illustrate the proposal:<br></p><p>Introduction<br></p><p>Swift used to force using ‘.self’ when accessing instance properties and functions, but since dropped this requirement, only to keep it for closure captures. It now feels inconsistent, and we have lost the automatic documentation of instance properties vs local variables and instance functions vs local functions or closures. This proposal offers to re-instate the original behaviour.<br></p><p>Motivation<br></p><p>The previous behaviour which this proposal hopes to re-instate provided several advantages:<br></p><p>* When reading code, it makes it obvious which are instance properties and which are local variables, as well as which are instance functions and which are local functions/closures. Moreover, a sloppy programmer can make it hard to read his code if he does not constantly use self. or not.<br>* Avoids bugs where the author meant to use one a local variable but instead is unknowingly using an instance property (and the other way round).<br></p><p>One example of a bug avoided by the original proposal (provided by Rudolf Adamkovic):<br></p><p>class MyViewController : UIViewController {<br>	@IBOutlet var button: UIButton!<br>        var name: String = “David&quot;<br></p><p>	func updateButton() {<br>		// var title = “Hello \(name)”<br>		button.setTitle(title, forState: .Normal) // forgot to comment this line but the compiler does not complain and title is now referencing UIViewController’s title by mistake<br>		button.setTitleColor(UIColor.blackColor(), forState: .Normal)<br>	}<br>}<br></p><p>The API Design Guidelines &lt;https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines.html&gt; are meant for writing APIs but I still think they represent fundamentals of Swift. The two first points are:<br></p><p>	• Clarity at the point of use is your most important goal. Code is read far more than it is written.<br>	• Clarity is more important than brevity. Although Swift code can be compact, it is a non-goal to enable the smallest possible code with the fewest characters. Brevity in Swift code, where it occurs, is a side-effect of the strong type system and features that naturally reduce boilerplate.<br></p><p>And I believe that the proposition is directly in line with those objectives.<br></p><p>Proposed solution<br></p><p>Re-instante the previous behaviour where ‘self.’ was required to access instance properties and functions.<br></p><p>Detailed design<br></p><p>It would not require changes to the grammar, and I think (not a compiler engineer) that it would require minimal amount of work.<br></p><p>Impact on existing code<br></p><p>A lot of code written since the original change would be impacted by this proposal, but it seems like it can be easily fixed by both the migrator tool and Auto Fixes.<br></p><p>Alternatives considered<br></p><p>The alternative is to keep the current behaviour, but it has the aforementioned disadvantages<br></p><p>&gt; On 04 Dec 2015, at 22:51, Rudolf Adamkovic &lt;salutis at me.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; +1<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1) I actually encountered at least two bugs in my app introduced by this implicit &quot;self&quot; behavior.
