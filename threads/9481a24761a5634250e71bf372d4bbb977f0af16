It fills the same space as the underscored protocols in the standard library: it allows us to ship a product that is useful, but they are both far from ideal.  The _ protocols were generally forced by some limitations in the generics system and other parts of the compiler.  GYB is needed by those, but also by the fact that we don’t have a hygienic macro system (we certainly won’t have a macro system in Swift 3, but could consider it after that).<br></p><p>The good news is that the need for these things is being reduced as Swift improves.<br></p><p>-Chris<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
