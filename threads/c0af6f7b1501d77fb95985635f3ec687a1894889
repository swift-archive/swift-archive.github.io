That expression parser can run in two modes.  In one, the expression parser emulates &quot;code run in the context of the currently selected frame.&quot; This is the expression parser invoked with no special options.  In the other it emulates code typed into a main swift file (albeit incrementally evaluated) - use &quot;expr --repl&quot; for this mode.  In this mode the expressions can see other entities defined in the REPL, and you can load swift modules into to REPL.  But it doesn&#39;t have access to local variables, etc.<br></p><p>So if you are trying to use the expression evaluator alongside a program you are debugging, then you want the basic expression evaluator, not the REPL.  If you want to use the expression evaluator as a place to just try out code ab initio, you want &quot;expr --repl&quot;.<br></p><p>The overall &quot;lldb --repl&quot; which is pretty much what the &quot;swift&quot; command with no arguments does, also starts up a trivial target app so we&#39;ll have something into which to inject code.<br></p><p>There are also SB API&#39;s to access both modes of expression evaluation.  For instance, you can evaluate a single expression in REPL mode using the SBExpressionEvaluationOptions SetREPLEnabled for this purpose.  You would use these in SBTarget::EvaluateExpression or SBFrame::EvaluateExpression.<br></p><p>The other part of the REPL is all the input magic it does to handle multi-line editing, etc.  That code as written relies on cooperation between the IOHandler classes that deal with input and the overall lldb driver program, and isn&#39;t quite a cleanly separated as it should be.  It is our intention to make the IOHandler code more easily useable by other external clients, but that work is still on the drawing board.  In the mean time, you would just gather user input and feed it to the expression parser with the appropriate options.<br></p><p>Jim<br></p><p>&gt; On Dec 7, 2015, at 2:16 PM, Gage Morgan via swift-lldb-dev &lt;swift-lldb-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; VSCode is Microsoft&#39;s open source IDE.
