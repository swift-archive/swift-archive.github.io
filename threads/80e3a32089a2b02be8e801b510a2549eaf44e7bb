The result reflects the order in which the arguments to the<br>function appear in a call.  So if f reflects standard dictionary order, <br></p><p>    f(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) =&gt; ascending<br>    f(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;) =&gt; descending<br></p><p>&gt; One thing I was considering, but didn&#39;t do since my extension is just<br>&gt; a bolt-on for convenience, is whether the before/ascending and<br>&gt; after/descending cases should contain a value, allowing<br>&gt; implementations to provide a hint of how far back/forward an element<br>&gt; should be. This is a hint only of course, but could be useful; for<br>&gt; example, when implementing a binary search you could instead use the<br>&gt; hint value to provide a (hopefully) better guess at where to jump to<br>&gt; next, for example if the value is very high you might jump to a<br>&gt; position forward backward/forward rather than always selecting the<br>&gt; middle every time. This is what Java&#39;s Comparable type does, since it<br>&gt; uses a number where negative is before, 0 is same and positive is<br>&gt; after.  <br></p><p>I&#39;m deeply skeptical.  I don&#39;t believe you can use this hint to do<br>binary search without destroying its complexity guarantee.  If you can<br>show me algorithms that take advantage of this hint, with demonstrations<br>of their correctness, I&#39;d consider it.<br></p><p>&gt; Why is Equatable in this case implemented with a static .areSame()<br>&gt; method, but Comparable isn&#39;t implemented by a static .compare()<br>&gt; method? Seems like they should both be the same personally.  <br></p><p>Because we wouldn&#39;t be able to .compare() tuples, which are not nominal<br>types that can be extended.  That&#39;s almost the only reason, IIRC.<br></p><p>&gt; There should be a way to &quot;flip&quot; the operator. One thing that&#39;s great<br>&gt; about the current sorting method is the ability to pass the &lt; or &gt;<br>&gt; operators for ascending/descending respectively, we can do the first<br>&gt; one by passing the &lt;=&gt; operator, but a flip function or something<br>&gt; would be nice to, well, flip it (swap the ascending and descending<br>&gt; cases before returning).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Just some thoughts, but I definitely want this.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; On 22 Jul 2016, at 02:11, Robert Widmann via swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt; &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Hello Swift Community,<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Harlan Haskins, Jaden Geller, and I have been working on a proposal<br>&gt;&gt; to clean up the semantics of ordering relations in the standard<br>&gt;&gt; library.
