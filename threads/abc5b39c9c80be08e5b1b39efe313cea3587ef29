Kotlin  is based on Java byte code compatibility so it<br>really an Android only solution. JavaScript work across platforms but has<br>limited functionality based on its programming model.

Since i can already generate Android ARM code from Swift<br>on Linux, we just need to ability to call Android 18K API calls to be fully<br>Android complaint. Since Swift support Clang modules which is basically a C<br>lib with a module map, I can write JNI calls to the Android Java API via<br>these modules in C.

The problem is that you have<br>&gt;&gt; to mirror the Android SDK on Swift and code Swift like Java. You would have<br>&gt;&gt; to update the compiler for every new Java Class you would need to generate<br>&gt;&gt; which is not flexible but doable.<br>&gt;&gt; b)  Other people have tried to port the entire Swift toolchain to Android<br>&gt;&gt; but that far too much work and Swift is changing too fast to make that<br>&gt;&gt; feasible. Observe the dead projects on GitHub.<br>&gt;&gt; c)  My first thought was to create a shim that routing messages from the<br>&gt;&gt; Swift app to a Java app which translated them to API calls but this has<br>&gt;&gt; bootstrapping issues and code maintenance issues.<br>&gt;&gt; d)  My second thought  is to use JNI, as it already been proven that you<br>&gt;&gt; can call C code from Swift which in turn can call Android Java code. This<br>&gt;&gt; approach require lots of bindings and a bootstrap of the Android runtime<br>&gt;&gt; and god knows how many third party libs. The java app also wants to be in<br>&gt;&gt; charge and load the JNI bindings as a so file via its LoadLibrary() call.<br>&gt;&gt; It might be easier to call Swift from Java rather than the other way round<br>&gt;&gt; if the Swift code could be built as a library. Writing JNI glue code does<br>&gt;&gt; not excite me.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;  Since I can already build Swift on Linux and ARM, I do have the ability<br>&gt;&gt; to generate an Android runnable app from Swift code. The only issue is that<br>&gt;&gt; I am using the Android NDK way of writing Android which provides access to<br>&gt;&gt; only the C++ API of Android which is far smaller API surface that the huge<br>&gt;&gt; Java API surface and its big runtime. This evolves  Swift calling an LVM<br>&gt;&gt;  module library that contains C code that call the Android NDK API which<br>&gt;&gt; bootstrap the NativeActivity class in Android (and the android runtime) and<br>&gt;&gt; from there you can access the Camera and multimedia API just not the GUI<br>&gt;&gt; widgets.<br>&gt;&gt;   This is not too soon to think about as Swift language changes are<br>&gt;&gt; supposed to be minimal until Swift 4.0. Of course Google could do the work<br>&gt;&gt; for me but I not holding my breath. You can also build Android GUI apps<br>&gt;&gt; without every referencing the Google Service API but I do notice that the<br>&gt;&gt; Google Service API is being extended because it does not require an Android<br>&gt;&gt; OS update to get new features into Android..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; On Thu, Oct 13, 2016 at 5:20 PM, Hooman Mehr &lt;hooman at mac.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I think it is too soon to tackle this issue.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I think there is room for making adapters for a lightweight GUI toolkit<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; for embedded applications. For example, a Swift adapter for EFL<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;https://www.enlightenment.org/about-efl&gt; (of Enlightenment) or<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; something like that. But when we talk about Android, we are usually talking<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; about a real Android app that can be a good citizen in Google ecosystem. I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; don’t think this is feasible right now.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Current Android GUI services is too intertwined with its proprietary<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; runtime and VM and Google is continuing to tie them harder and harder to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; its Google services API. Unless Google starts treating non-Dalvik-based<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; languages as first class citizens in Android development world, there is no<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; point in trying to make Swift usable as a GUI development language for<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Android.
