However, it is horribly inefficient to implement<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; optional integers. It takes double the space to store [Int?] than<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; to store [Int] because of alignment.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Is this a general problem with Swift? Are lots of people complaining that they are running out of<br>&gt; space for their Optional&lt;Int&gt; arrays?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt; It&#39;s just that a common data type wasting almost half the space seems<br>&gt; inefficient. I guess this is also the reason why they didn&#39;t adopt<br>&gt; optional integers widely in stdlib.<br></p><p>For the record, we made no explicit choice to avoid optional integers.<br>We&#39;d use them wherever it was appropriate.<br></p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I propose to ban the top value in Int/UInt which is 0xFFFF... in<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; hex. Int family would lose its smallest value, and UInt family<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; would lose its largest value. Top value is reserved for nil in<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; optionals. An additional benefit is that negating an Int would<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; never crash.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Well the “top value” for signed ints would have to be 0x8000... not<br>&gt;&gt; 0xffff... which is the representation of -1. The top value for<br>&gt;&gt; unsigned ints cannot be banned because unsigned integers are often<br>&gt;&gt; used as bit fields either directly or in OptionSets.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Furthermore, how would the semantics of &amp;+ and &amp;- be affected? What<br>&gt;&gt; about the performance of those two operators?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt; I was originally going for the symmetry between Int and UInt as in<br>&gt; compatible bit patterns. Now that I think of it, UInt is commonly used<br>&gt; for bitwise operations, and it doesn&#39;t make sense to optimize for<br>&gt; &quot;UInt?&quot; which is uncommon. So I agree that 0x80... is better.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Int performance would surely suffer because of current instruction<br>&gt; sets, but Int? would improve.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; So what do you think? Can we break C compatibility a bit for better Swift types?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Well it’s not just C compatibility, it’s underlying processor<br>&gt;&gt; compatibility. And actually, yes, I think C compatibility is vastly<br>&gt;&gt; more important than being able to make your [Int?] arrays smaller<br>&gt;&gt; considering that full 2’s complement numbers is what the OS calls<br>&gt;&gt; and libc calls are expecting.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt; Yes, that is also the result Joe said of their previous internal<br>&gt; discussion. Anyway, I know this is improbable, and I&#39;m just glad that<br>&gt; this possibility is considered.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - Guoye<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
