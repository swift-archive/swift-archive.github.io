If you think of Swift as a value-typed language with an OOP layer added, then you&#39;ll probably think Swift prefers static dispatch. In reality, Swift is a hybrid language and it uses different types of dispatch in different situations as appropriate.<br></p><p>(emphasis mine)<br></p><p>I know that this is a bit philosophical, but let me suggest a “next level down” way to look at this.  Static and dynamic are *both* great after all, and if you’re looking to type-cast languages, you need to consider them both in light of their semantics, but also factor in their compilation strategy and the programmer model that they all provide.  Let me give you some examples, but keep in mind that this is a narrow view and just MHO:<br></p><p>1. C: Static compilation model, static semantics.  While it does provide indirect function pointers, C does everything possible to punish their use (ever see the non-typedef&#39;d prototype for signal(3/7)?), and is almost always statically compiled.  It provides a very “static centric” programming model.  This is great in terms of predictability - it makes it trivial to “predict” what your code will look like at a machine level.<br></p><p>2. Javascript: Completely dynamic compilation model, completely dynamic semantics.  No one talks about statically compiling javascript, because the result of doing so would be a really really slow executable.  Javascript performance hinges on dynamic profile information to be able to efficiently execute a program.  This provides a very “dynamic centric” programming model, with no ability to understand how your code executes at a machine level.<br></p><p>3. C++: C++ is a step up from C in terms of introducing dynamism into the model with virtual functions.   Sadly, C++ also provides a hostile model for static optimizability - the existence of placement new prevents a lot of interesting devirtualization opportunities, and generally makes the compiler’s life difficult.  OTOH, like C, C++ provides a very predictable model: C++ programmers assume that C constructs are static, but virtual methods will be dynamically dispatched.  This is correct because (except for narrow cases) the compiler has to use dynamic dispatch for C++ virtual methods.   The good news here is that its dynamism is completely opt in, so C++ preserves all of the predictability, performance, and static-compilability of C while providing a higher level programming model.  If virtual methods are ever actually a performance problem, a C++ programmer has ways to deal with that, directly in their code.<br></p><p>4. Java: Java makes nearly &quot;everything&quot; an object (no structs or other non-primitive value types), and all methods default to being “virtual” (in the C++ sense).  Java also introduces interfaces, which offer an added dimension on dynamic dispatch.  To cope with this, Java assumes a JIT compilation model, which can use dynamic behavior to de-virtualize the (almost always) monomorphic calls into checked direct calls.  This works out really well in practice, because JIT compilers are great at telling when a program with apparently very dynamic semantics actually have static semantics in practice (e.g. a dynamic call has a single receiver).  OTOH, since the compilation model assumes a JIT, this means that purely “AOT” static compilers (which have no profile information, no knowledge of class loaders, etc) necessarily produce inferior code.  It also means that Java doesn’t “scale down” well to small embedded systems that can’t support a JIT, like a bootloader.<br></p><p>5) Objective-C: Objective-C provides a hybrid model which favors predictability due to its static compilation model (similar in some ways to C++).  The C-like constructs provide C-like performance, and the “messaging” constructs are never “devirtualized”, so they provide very predictable performance characteristics.  Because it is predictable, if the cost of a message send ever becomes an issue in practice, the programmer has many patterns to deal with it (including &quot;imp caching&quot;, and also including the ability to define the problem away by rewriting code in terms of C constructs).  The end result of this is that programmers write code which use C-level features where performance matters and dynamicism doesn’t, but use ObjC features where dynamicism is important or where performance doesn’t matter.<br></p><p>While it would be possible to implement a JIT compiler for ObjC, I’d expect the wins to be low, because the “hot” code which may be hinging on these dynamic features is likely to already be optimized by hand.<br></p><p>6) GoLang: From this narrow discussion and perspective, Go has a hybrid model that has similar characteristics to Objective-C 2013 (which introduced modules, but didn’t yet have generics).  It assumes static compilation and provides a very predictable hybrid programming model.  Its func’s are statically dispatched, but its interfaces are dynamically dispatched.  It doesn’t provide guaranteed dynamic dispatch (or “classes&quot;) like ObjC, but it provides even more dynamic feautres in other areas (e.g. it requires a cycle-collecting garbage collector).  Its &quot;interface{}” type is pretty equivalent to “id” (e.g. all uses of it are dynamically dispatched or must be downcasted), and it encourages use of it in the same places that Objective-C does.  Go introduces checked downcasts, which introduce some run-time overhead, but also provide safety compared to Objective-C. Go thankfully introduces a replacement for the imperative constructs in C, which defines away a bunch of C problems that Objective-C inherited, and it certainly is prettier!<br></p><p>… I can go on about other languages, but I have probably already gotten myself into enough trouble. :-)<br></p><p><br>With this as context, lets talk about Swift:<br></p><p>Swift is another case of a hybrid model: its semantics provide predictability between obviously static (structs, enums, and global funcs) and obviously dynamic (classes, protocols, and closures) constructs.  A focus of Swift (like Java and Javascript) is to provide an apparently simple programming model.  However, Swift also intentionally &quot;cheats&quot; in its global design by mixing in a few tricks to make the dynamic parts of the language optimizable by a static compiler in many common cases, without requiring profiling or other dynamic information..  For example, the Swift compiler can tell if methods in non-public classes are never overridden (and non-public is the default, for a lot of good reasons) - thus treating them as final.  This allows eliminating much of the overhead of dynamic dispatch without requiring a JIT.  Consider an “app”: because it never needs to have non-public classes, this is incredibly powerful - the design of the swift package manager extends this even further (in principle, not done yet) to external libraries. Further, Swift’s generics provide an a static performance model similar to C++ templates in release builds (though I agree we need to do more to really follow through on this) -- while Swift existentials (values of protocol type) provide a balance by giving a highly dynamic model.<br></p><p>The upshot of this is that Swift isn’t squarely in either of the static or dynamic camps: it aims to provide a very predictable performance model (someone writing a bootloader or firmware can stick to using Swift structs and have a simple guarantee of no dynamic overhead or runtime dependence) while also providing an expressive and clean high level programming model - simplifying learning and the common case where programmers don’t care to count cycles.  If anything, I’d say that Swift is an “opportunistic” language, in that it provides a very dynamic “default&quot; programming model, where you don’t have to think about the fact that a static compiler is able to transparently provide great performance - without needing the overhead of a JIT.<br></p><p>Finally, while it is possible that a JIT compiler might be interesting someday in the Swift space, if we do things right, it will never be “worth it” because programmers will have enough ability to reason about performance at their fingertips.  This means that there should be no Java or Javascript-magnitude &quot;performance delta&quot; sitting on the table waiting for a JIT to scoop up.  We’ll see how it works out long term, but I think we’re doing pretty well so far.<br></p><p>TL;DR: What I’m really getting at is that the old static vs dynamic trope is at the very least only half of the story.  You really need to include the compilation model and thus the resultant programmer model into the story, and the programmer model is what really matters, IMHO.<br></p><p>-Chris<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160520/04d686b8/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/697f00e1b9be900f24cd1669cc931874?s=50"></div><header><strong>Static Dispatch Pitfalls</strong> from <string>L.

Need to resolve (heuristic is static)<br>Invokevirtual: obj type methods. Need to resolve (static heuristic)<br>Invokeinterface: iface type methods. Needs to resolve (static heuristic)<br>Invokedynamic: indy is special because the resolution heuristic is user customizable and even reversible at runtime (user code can rewrite the behavior of a callsite) all the while being highly optimized inside the jit compiler (lambdas use it &amp; jdk9 will optimize string concats with it). this is a huge improvement in jvms.<br></p><p>Graal is a upcoming(?) jit implemented in java that supports more agressive per call site optimizations (like same target code inlined differently depending on callsite behavior, including optimistic type specializations per code paths, all reversible).

In reality, Swift is a hybrid language and it uses different types of dispatch in different situations as appropriate.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; (emphasis mine)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I know that this is a bit philosophical, but let me suggest a “next level down” way to look at this.  Static and dynamic are *both* great after all, and if you’re looking to type-cast languages, you need to consider them both in light of their semantics, but also factor in their compilation strategy and the programmer model that they all provide.  Let me give you some examples, but keep in mind that this is a narrow view and just MHO:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 1. C: Static compilation model, static semantics.  While it does provide indirect function pointers, C does everything possible to punish their use (ever see the non-typedef&#39;d prototype for signal(3/7)?), and is almost always statically compiled.  It provides a very “static centric” programming model.  This is great in terms of predictability - it makes it trivial to “predict” what your code will look like at a machine level.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 2. Javascript: Completely dynamic compilation model, completely dynamic semantics.  No one talks about statically compiling javascript, because the result of doing so would be a really really slow executable.  Javascript performance hinges on dynamic profile information to be able to efficiently execute a program.  This provides a very “dynamic centric” programming model, with no ability to understand how your code executes at a machine level.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 3. C++: C++ is a step up from C in terms of introducing dynamism into the model with virtual functions.   Sadly, C++ also provides a hostile model for static optimizability - the existence of placement new prevents a lot of interesting devirtualization opportunities, and generally makes the compiler’s life difficult.  OTOH, like C, C++ provides a very predictable model: C++ programmers assume that C constructs are static, but virtual methods will be dynamically dispatched.  This is correct because (except for narrow cases) the compiler has to use dynamic dispatch for C++ virtual methods.   The good news here is that its dynamism is completely opt in, so C++ preserves all of the predictability, performance, and static-compilability of C while providing a higher level programming model.  If virtual methods are ever actually a performance problem, a C++ programmer has ways to deal with that, directly in their code.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 4. Java: Java makes nearly &quot;everything&quot; an object (no structs or other non-primitive value types), and all methods default to being “virtual” (in the C++ sense).  Java also introduces interfaces, which offer an added dimension on dynamic dispatch.  To cope with this, Java assumes a JIT compilation model, which can use dynamic behavior to de-virtualize the (almost always) monomorphic calls into checked direct calls.  This works out really well in practice, because JIT compilers are great at telling when a program with apparently very dynamic semantics actually have static semantics in practice (e.g. a dynamic call has a single receiver).  OTOH, since the compilation model assumes a JIT, this means that purely “AOT” static compilers (which have no profile information, no knowledge of class loaders, etc) necessarily produce inferior code.  It also means that Java doesn’t “scale down” well to small embedded systems that can’t support a JIT, like a bootloader.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 5) Objective-C: Objective-C provides a hybrid model which favors predictability due to its static compilation model (similar in some ways to C++).  The C-like constructs provide C-like performance, and the “messaging” constructs are never “devirtualized”, so they provide very predictable performance characteristics.  Because it is predictable, if the cost of a message send ever becomes an issue in practice, the programmer has many patterns to deal with it (including &quot;imp caching&quot;, and also including the ability to define the problem away by rewriting code in terms of C constructs).  The end result of this is that programmers write code which use C-level features where performance matters and dynamicism doesn’t, but use ObjC features where dynamicism is important or where performance doesn’t matter.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; While it would be possible to implement a JIT compiler for ObjC, I’d expect the wins to be low, because the “hot” code which may be hinging on these dynamic features is likely to already be optimized by hand.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 6) GoLang: From this narrow discussion and perspective, Go has a hybrid model that has similar characteristics to Objective-C 2013 (which introduced modules, but didn’t yet have generics).  It assumes static compilation and provides a very predictable hybrid programming model.  Its func’s are statically dispatched, but its interfaces are dynamically dispatched.  It doesn’t provide guaranteed dynamic dispatch (or “classes&quot;) like ObjC, but it provides even more dynamic feautres in other areas (e.g. it requires a cycle-collecting garbage collector).  Its &quot;interface{}” type is pretty equivalent to “id” (e.g. all uses of it are dynamically dispatched or must be downcasted), and it encourages use of it in the same places that Objective-C does.  Go introduces checked downcasts, which introduce some run-time overhead, but also provide safety compared to Objective-C. Go thankfully introduces a replacement for the imperative constructs in C, which defines away a bunch of C problems that Objective-C inherited, and it certainly is prettier!<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; … I can go on about other languages, but I have probably already gotten myself into enough trouble. :-)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; With this as context, lets talk about Swift:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Swift is another case of a hybrid model: its semantics provide predictability between obviously static (structs, enums, and global funcs) and obviously dynamic (classes, protocols, and closures) constructs.  A focus of Swift (like Java and Javascript) is to provide an apparently simple programming model.  However, Swift also intentionally &quot;cheats&quot; in its global design by mixing in a few tricks to make the dynamic parts of the language optimizable by a static compiler in many common cases, without requiring profiling or other dynamic information..  For example, the Swift compiler can tell if methods in non-public classes are never overridden (and non-public is the default, for a lot of good reasons) - thus treating them as final.  This allows eliminating much of the overhead of dynamic dispatch without requiring a JIT.  Consider an “app”: because it never needs to have non-public classes, this is incredibly powerful - the design of the swift package manager extends this even further (in principle, not done yet) to external libraries. Further, Swift’s generics provide an a static performance model similar to C++ templates in release builds (though I agree we need to do more to really follow through on this) -- while Swift existentials (values of protocol type) provide a balance by giving a highly dynamic model.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The upshot of this is that Swift isn’t squarely in either of the static or dynamic camps: it aims to provide a very predictable performance model (someone writing a bootloader or firmware can stick to using Swift structs and have a simple guarantee of no dynamic overhead or runtime dependence) while also providing an expressive and clean high level programming model - simplifying learning and the common case where programmers don’t care to count cycles.  If anything, I’d say that Swift is an “opportunistic” language, in that it provides a very dynamic “default&quot; programming model, where you don’t have to think about the fact that a static compiler is able to transparently provide great performance - without needing the overhead of a JIT.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Finally, while it is possible that a JIT compiler might be interesting someday in the Swift space, if we do things right, it will never be “worth it” because programmers will have enough ability to reason about performance at their fingertips.  This means that there should be no Java or Javascript-magnitude &quot;performance delta&quot; sitting on the table waiting for a JIT to scoop up.  We’ll see how it works out long term, but I think we’re doing pretty well so far.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; TL;DR: What I’m really getting at is that the old static vs dynamic trope is at the very least only half of the story.  You really need to include the compilation model and thus the resultant programmer model into the story, and the programmer model is what really matters, IMHO.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; -Chris<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160520/d416d478/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc3a9ea0c6c870343d9acb4ac3059cdc?s=50"></div><header><strong>Static Dispatch Pitfalls</strong> from <string>Matthew Johnson</string> &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt;<p>May 20, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On May 20, 2016, at 11:17 AM, Austin Zheng via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I almost want to propose forbidding methods in protocol extensions unless they&#39;re also a requirement in the protocol itself, but I don&#39;t think that would fly.<br></p><p>That would prevent us from adding extension methods to protocols declared in modules we depend on.

Java: Java makes nearly &quot;everything&quot; an object (no structs or other non-primitive value types), and all methods default to being “virtual” (in the C++ sense).  Java also introduces interfaces, which offer an added dimension on dynamic dispatch.  To cope with this, Java assumes a JIT compilation model, which can use dynamic behavior to de-virtualize the (almost always) monomorphic calls into checked direct calls.  This works out really well in practice, because JIT compilers are great at telling when a program with apparently very dynamic semantics actually have static semantics in practice (e.g. a dynamic call has a single receiver).  OTOH, since the compilation model assumes a JIT, this means that purely “AOT” static compilers (which have no profile information, no knowledge of class loaders, etc) necessarily produce inferior code.  It also means that Java doesn’t “scale down” well to small embedded systems that can’t support a JIT, like a bootloader.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5) Objective-C: Objective-C provides a hybrid model which favors predictability due to its static compilation model (similar in some ways to C++).

Because it is predictable, if the cost of a message send ever becomes an issue in practice, the programmer has many patterns to deal with it (including &quot;imp caching&quot;, and also including the ability to define the problem away by rewriting code in terms of C constructs).  The end result of this is that programmers write code which use C-level features where performance matters and dynamicism doesn’t, but use ObjC features where dynamicism is important or where performance doesn’t matter.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While it would be possible to implement a JIT compiler for ObjC, I’d expect the wins to be low, because the “hot” code which may be hinging on these dynamic features is likely to already be optimized by hand.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6) GoLang: From this narrow discussion and perspective, Go has a hybrid model that has similar characteristics to Objective-C 2013 (which introduced modules, but didn’t yet have generics).  It assumes static compilation and provides a very predictable hybrid programming model.  Its func’s are statically dispatched, but its interfaces are dynamically dispatched.  It doesn’t provide guaranteed dynamic dispatch (or “classes&quot;) like ObjC, but it provides even more dynamic feautres in other areas (e.g. it requires a cycle-collecting garbage collector).  Its &quot;interface{}” type is pretty equivalent to “id” (e.g. all uses of it are dynamically dispatched or must be downcasted), and it encourages use of it in the same places that Objective-C does.  Go introduces checked downcasts, which introduce some run-time overhead, but also provide safety compared to Objective-C. Go thankfully introduces a replacement for the imperative constructs in C, which defines away a bunch of C problems that Objective-C inherited, and it certainly is prettier!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; … I can go on about other languages, but I have probably already gotten myself into enough trouble. :-)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With this as context, lets talk about Swift:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift is another case of a hybrid model: its semantics provide predictability between obviously static (structs, enums, and global funcs) and obviously dynamic (classes, protocols, and closures) constructs.  A focus of Swift (like Java and Javascript) is to provide an apparently simple programming model.  However, Swift also intentionally &quot;cheats&quot; in its global design by mixing in a few tricks to make the dynamic parts of the language optimizable by a static compiler in many common cases, without requiring profiling or other dynamic information..  For example, the Swift compiler can tell if methods in non-public classes are never overridden (and non-public is the default, for a lot of good reasons) - thus treating them as final.  This allows eliminating much of the overhead of dynamic dispatch without requiring a JIT.  Consider an “app”: because it never needs to have non-public classes, this is incredibly powerful - the design of the swift package manager extends this even further (in principle, not done yet) to external libraries. Further, Swift’s generics provide an a static performance model similar to C++ templates in release builds (though I agree we need to do more to really follow through on this) -- while Swift existentials (values of protocol type) provide a balance by giving a highly dynamic model.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The upshot of this is that Swift isn’t squarely in either of the static or dynamic camps: it aims to provide a very predictable performance model (someone writing a bootloader or firmware can stick to using Swift structs and have a simple guarantee of no dynamic overhead or runtime dependence) while also providing an expressive and clean high level programming model - simplifying learning and the common case where programmers don’t care to count cycles.  If anything, I’d say that Swift is an “opportunistic” language, in that it provides a very dynamic “default&quot; programming model, where you don’t have to think about the fact that a static compiler is able to transparently provide great performance - without needing the overhead of a JIT.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Finally, while it is possible that a JIT compiler might be interesting someday in the Swift space, if we do things right, it will never be “worth it” because programmers will have enough ability to reason about performance at their fingertips.  This means that there should be no Java or Javascript-magnitude &quot;performance delta&quot; sitting on the table waiting for a JIT to scoop up.  We’ll see how it works out long term, but I think we’re doing pretty well so far.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TL;DR: What I’m really getting at is that the old static vs dynamic trope is at the very least only half of the story.  You really need to include the compilation model and thus the resultant programmer model into the story, and the programmer model is what really matters, IMHO.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Chris<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160520/d82f1a72/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9bfba345bd373f7b8874d58fed6372ff?s=50"></div><header><strong>Static Dispatch Pitfalls</strong> from <string>David Waite</string> &lt;david at alkaline-solutions.com&gt;<p>May 20, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On May 20, 2016, at 10:43 AM, Brandon Knope via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; From the compilers/runtimes perspective why couldn&#39;t the declaration automatically be included in the main protocol definition as if it was defined there?<br></p><p>Assuming you have protocol extenders and protocol implementors as different people, they are competing in the same problem space.

So in the spirit of incrementalism, I was trying to make cautious proposals which kept existing semantics intact but made them clearer, in preparation for perhaps eventually introducing dynamic dispatch. (Basically, I suggested that non-overridable protocol extension members should be marked `final` and it should be illegal to shadow them.)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; But the feedback I got indicated that most people wanted a more aggressive proposal which introduced dynamic dispatch immediately.

If you think of Swift as an OOP language with a powerful value-typed system added on, then you&#39;ll probably think Swift prefers virtual dispatch. If you think of Swift as a value-typed language with an OOP layer added, then you&#39;ll probably think Swift prefers static dispatch. In reality, Swift is a hybrid language and it uses different types of dispatch in different situations as appropriate.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (emphasis mine)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know that this is a bit philosophical, but let me suggest a “next level down” way to look at this.  Static and dynamic are *both* great after all, and if you’re looking to type-cast languages, you need to consider them both in light of their semantics, but also factor in their compilation strategy and the programmer model that they all provide.  Let me give you some examples, but keep in mind that this is a narrow view and just MHO:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. C: Static compilation model, static semantics.  While it does provide indirect function pointers, C does everything possible to punish their use (ever see the non-typedef&#39;d prototype for signal(3/7)?), and is almost always statically compiled.  It provides a very “static centric” programming model.  This is great in terms of predictability - it makes it trivial to “predict” what your code will look like at a machine level.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Javascript: Completely dynamic compilation model, completely dynamic semantics.  No one talks about statically compiling javascript, because the result of doing so would be a really really slow executable.  Javascript performance hinges on dynamic profile information to be able to efficiently execute a program.  This provides a very “dynamic centric” programming model, with no ability to understand how your code executes at a machine level.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. C++: C++ is a step up from C in terms of introducing dynamism into the model with virtual functions.   Sadly, C++ also provides a hostile model for static optimizability - the existence of placement new prevents a lot of interesting devirtualization opportunities, and generally makes the compiler’s life difficult.  OTOH, like C, C++ provides a very predictable model: C++ programmers assume that C constructs are static, but virtual methods will be dynamically dispatched.  This is correct because (except for narrow cases) the compiler has to use dynamic dispatch for C++ virtual methods.   The good news here is that its dynamism is completely opt in, so C++ preserves all of the predictability, performance, and static-compilability of C while providing a higher level programming model.  If virtual methods are ever actually a performance problem, a C++ programmer has ways to deal with that, directly in their code.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4.

If you think of Swift as an OOP language with a powerful value-typed system added on, then you&#39;ll probably think Swift prefers virtual dispatch. If you think of Swift as a value-typed language with an OOP layer added, then you&#39;ll probably think Swift prefers static dispatch. In reality, Swift is a hybrid language and it uses different types of dispatch in different situations as appropriate.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (emphasis mine)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know that this is a bit philosophical, but let me suggest a “next level down” way to look at this.  Static and dynamic are *both* great after all, and if you’re looking to type-cast languages, you need to consider them both in light of their semantics, but also factor in their compilation strategy and the programmer model that they all provide.  Let me give you some examples, but keep in mind that this is a narrow view and just MHO:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. C: Static compilation model, static semantics.  While it does provide indirect function pointers, C does everything possible to punish their use (ever see the non-typedef&#39;d prototype for signal(3/7)?), and is almost always statically compiled.  It provides a very “static centric” programming model.  This is great in terms of predictability - it makes it trivial to “predict” what your code will look like at a machine level.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Javascript: Completely dynamic compilation model, completely dynamic semantics.  No one talks about statically compiling javascript, because the result of doing so would be a really really slow executable.  Javascript performance hinges on dynamic profile information to be able to efficiently execute a program.  This provides a very “dynamic centric” programming model, with no ability to understand how your code executes at a machine level.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. C++: C++ is a step up from C in terms of introducing dynamism into the model with virtual functions.   Sadly, C++ also provides a hostile model for static optimizability - the existence of placement new prevents a lot of interesting devirtualization opportunities, and generally makes the compiler’s life difficult.  OTOH, like C, C++ provides a very predictable model: C++ programmers assume that C constructs are static, but virtual methods will be dynamically dispatched.  This is correct because (except for narrow cases) the compiler has to use dynamic dispatch for C++ virtual methods.   The good news here is that its dynamism is completely opt in, so C++ preserves all of the predictability, performance, and static-compilability of C while providing a higher level programming model.  If virtual methods are ever actually a performance problem, a C++ programmer has ways to deal with that, directly in their code.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. Java: Java makes nearly &quot;everything&quot; an object (no structs or other non-primitive value types), and all methods default to being “virtual” (in the C++ sense).  Java also introduces interfaces, which offer an added dimension on dynamic dispatch.  To cope with this, Java assumes a JIT compilation model, which can use dynamic behavior to de-virtualize the (almost always) monomorphic calls into checked direct calls.  This works out really well in practice, because JIT compilers are great at telling when a program with apparently very dynamic semantics actually have static semantics in practice (e.g. a dynamic call has a single receiver).  OTOH, since the compilation model assumes a JIT, this means that purely “AOT” static compilers (which have no profile information, no knowledge of class loaders, etc) necessarily produce inferior code.  It also means that Java doesn’t “scale down” well to small embedded systems that can’t support a JIT, like a bootloader.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5) Objective-C: Objective-C provides a hybrid model which favors predictability due to its static compilation model (similar in some ways to C++).  The C-like constructs provide C-like performance, and the “messaging” constructs are never “devirtualized”, so they provide very predictable performance characteristics.  Because it is predictable, if the cost of a message send ever becomes an issue in practice, the programmer has many patterns to deal with it (including &quot;imp caching&quot;, and also including the ability to define the problem away by rewriting code in terms of C constructs).  The end result of this is that programmers write code which use C-level features where performance matters and dynamicism doesn’t, but use ObjC features where dynamicism is important or where performance doesn’t matter.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While it would be possible to implement a JIT compiler for ObjC, I’d expect the wins to be low, because the “hot” code which may be hinging on these dynamic features is likely to already be optimized by hand.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6) GoLang: From this narrow discussion and perspective, Go has a hybrid model that has similar characteristics to Objective-C 2013 (which introduced modules, but didn’t yet have generics).  It assumes static compilation and provides a very predictable hybrid programming model.  Its func’s are statically dispatched, but its interfaces are dynamically dispatched.  It doesn’t provide guaranteed dynamic dispatch (or “classes&quot;) like ObjC, but it provides even more dynamic feautres in other areas (e.g. it requires a cycle-collecting garbage collector).  Its &quot;interface{}” type is pretty equivalent to “id” (e.g. all uses of it are dynamically dispatched or must be downcasted), and it encourages use of it in the same places that Objective-C does.  Go introduces checked downcasts, which introduce some run-time overhead, but also provide safety compared to Objective-C. Go thankfully introduces a replacement for the imperative constructs in C, which defines away a bunch of C problems that Objective-C inherited, and it certainly is prettier!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; … I can go on about other languages, but I have probably already gotten myself into enough trouble. :-)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With this as context, lets talk about Swift:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift is another case of a hybrid model: its semantics provide predictability between obviously static (structs, enums, and global funcs) and obviously dynamic (classes, protocols, and closures) constructs.  A focus of Swift (like Java and Javascript) is to provide an apparently simple programming model.  However, Swift also intentionally &quot;cheats&quot; in its global design by mixing in a few tricks to make the dynamic parts of the language optimizable by a static compiler in many common cases, without requiring profiling or other dynamic information..  For example, the Swift compiler can tell if methods in non-public classes are never overridden (and non-public is the default, for a lot of good reasons) - thus treating them as final.  This allows eliminating much of the overhead of dynamic dispatch without requiring a JIT.  Consider an “app”: because it never needs to have non-public classes, this is incredibly powerful - the design of the swift package manager extends this even further (in principle, not done yet) to external libraries. Further, Swift’s generics provide an a static performance model similar to C++ templates in release builds (though I agree we need to do more to really follow through on this) -- while Swift existentials (values of protocol type) provide a balance by giving a highly dynamic model.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The upshot of this is that Swift isn’t squarely in either of the static or dynamic camps: it aims to provide a very predictable performance model (someone writing a bootloader or firmware can stick to using Swift structs and have a simple guarantee of no dynamic overhead or runtime dependence) while also providing an expressive and clean high level programming model - simplifying learning and the common case where programmers don’t care to count cycles.  If anything, I’d say that Swift is an “opportunistic” language, in that it provides a very dynamic “default&quot; programming model, where you don’t have to think about the fact that a static compiler is able to transparently provide great performance - without needing the overhead of a JIT.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Finally, while it is possible that a JIT compiler might be interesting someday in the Swift space, if we do things right, it will never be “worth it” because programmers will have enough ability to reason about performance at their fingertips.  This means that there should be no Java or Javascript-magnitude &quot;performance delta&quot; sitting on the table waiting for a JIT to scoop up.  We’ll see how it works out long term, but I think we’re doing pretty well so far.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TL;DR: What I’m really getting at is that the old static vs dynamic trope is at the very least only half of the story.

Because it is predictable, if the cost of a message send ever becomes an issue in practice, the programmer has many patterns to deal with it (including &quot;imp caching&quot;, and also including the ability to define the problem away by rewriting code in terms of C constructs).  The end result of this is that programmers write code which use C-level features where performance matters and dynamicism doesn’t, but use ObjC features where dynamicism is important or where performance doesn’t matter.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While it would be possible to implement a JIT compiler for ObjC, I’d expect the wins to be low, because the “hot” code which may be hinging on these dynamic features is likely to already be optimized by hand.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6) GoLang: From this narrow discussion and perspective, Go has a hybrid model that has similar characteristics to Objective-C 2013 (which introduced modules, but didn’t yet have generics).  It assumes static compilation and provides a very predictable hybrid programming model.  Its func’s are statically dispatched, but its interfaces are dynamically dispatched.  It doesn’t provide guaranteed dynamic dispatch (or “classes&quot;) like ObjC, but it provides even more dynamic feautres in other areas (e.g. it requires a cycle-collecting garbage collector).  Its &quot;interface{}” type is pretty equivalent to “id” (e.g. all uses of it are dynamically dispatched or must be downcasted), and it encourages use of it in the same places that Objective-C does.  Go introduces checked downcasts, which introduce some run-time overhead, but also provide safety compared to Objective-C. Go thankfully introduces a replacement for the imperative constructs in C, which defines away a bunch of C problems that Objective-C inherited, and it certainly is prettier!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; … I can go on about other languages, but I have probably already gotten myself into enough trouble. :-)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With this as context, lets talk about Swift:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift is another case of a hybrid model: its semantics provide predictability between obviously static (structs, enums, and global funcs) and obviously dynamic (classes, protocols, and closures) constructs.  A focus of Swift (like Java and Javascript) is to provide an apparently simple programming model.  However, Swift also intentionally &quot;cheats&quot; in its global design by mixing in a few tricks to make the dynamic parts of the language optimizable by a static compiler in many common cases, without requiring profiling or other dynamic information..  For example, the Swift compiler can tell if methods in non-public classes are never overridden (and non-public is the default, for a lot of good reasons) - thus treating them as final.  This allows eliminating much of the overhead of dynamic dispatch without requiring a JIT.  Consider an “app”: because it never needs to have non-public classes, this is incredibly powerful - the design of the swift package manager extends this even further (in principle, not done yet) to external libraries. Further, Swift’s generics provide an a static performance model similar to C++ templates in release builds (though I agree we need to do more to really follow through on this) -- while Swift existentials (values of protocol type) provide a balance by giving a highly dynamic model.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The upshot of this is that Swift isn’t squarely in either of the static or dynamic camps: it aims to provide a very predictable performance model (someone writing a bootloader or firmware can stick to using Swift structs and have a simple guarantee of no dynamic overhead or runtime dependence) while also providing an expressive and clean high level programming model - simplifying learning and the common case where programmers don’t care to count cycles.  If anything, I’d say that Swift is an “opportunistic” language, in that it provides a very dynamic “default&quot; programming model, where you don’t have to think about the fact that a static compiler is able to transparently provide great performance - without needing the overhead of a JIT.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Finally, while it is possible that a JIT compiler might be interesting someday in the Swift space, if we do things right, it will never be “worth it” because programmers will have enough ability to reason about performance at their fingertips.  This means that there should be no Java or Javascript-magnitude &quot;performance delta&quot; sitting on the table waiting for a JIT to scoop up.  We’ll see how it works out long term, but I think we’re doing pretty well so far.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TL;DR: What I’m really getting at is that the old static vs dynamic trope is at the very least only half of the story.  You really need to include the compilation model and thus the resultant programmer model into the story, and the programmer model is what really matters, IMHO.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Chris<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160520/c757cad6/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9bfba345bd373f7b8874d58fed6372ff?s=50"></div><header><strong>Static Dispatch Pitfalls</strong> from <string>David Waite</string> &lt;david at alkaline-solutions.com&gt;<p>May 20, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On May 20, 2016, at 10:17 AM, Austin Zheng via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I almost want to propose forbidding methods in protocol extensions unless they&#39;re also a requirement in the protocol itself, but I don&#39;t think that would fly.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Austin<br></p><p>Thats one option.<br></p><p>Think two separate developers - only who implements the protocol Foo and has an independent bar() method on their type, and one who writes an extension to Foo to add a bar method on it.<br></p><p>bar() is not part of the protocol specification. the person implementing the type has no idea that others are expecting his bar() to meet particular requirements, just because it was declared in a protocol extension. <br></p><p>So silently using the type implementor’s bar() method when using Foo is unacceptable.

If you think of Swift as a value-typed language with an OOP layer added, then you&#39;ll probably think Swift prefers static dispatch. In reality, Swift is a hybrid language and it uses different types of dispatch in different situations as appropriate.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (emphasis mine)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I know that this is a bit philosophical, but let me suggest a “next level down” way to look at this.  Static and dynamic are *both* great after all, and if you’re looking to type-cast languages, you need to consider them both in light of their semantics, but also factor in their compilation strategy and the programmer model that they all provide.  Let me give you some examples, but keep in mind that this is a narrow view and just MHO:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. C: Static compilation model, static semantics.  While it does provide indirect function pointers, C does everything possible to punish their use (ever see the non-typedef&#39;d prototype for signal(3/7)?), and is almost always statically compiled.  It provides a very “static centric” programming model.  This is great in terms of predictability - it makes it trivial to “predict” what your code will look like at a machine level.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Javascript: Completely dynamic compilation model, completely dynamic semantics.  No one talks about statically compiling javascript, because the result of doing so would be a really really slow executable.  Javascript performance hinges on dynamic profile information to be able to efficiently execute a program.  This provides a very “dynamic centric” programming model, with no ability to understand how your code executes at a machine level.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. C++: C++ is a step up from C in terms of introducing dynamism into the model with virtual functions.   Sadly, C++ also provides a hostile model for static optimizability - the existence of placement new prevents a lot of interesting devirtualization opportunities, and generally makes the compiler’s life difficult.  OTOH, like C, C++ provides a very predictable model: C++ programmers assume that C constructs are static, but virtual methods will be dynamically dispatched.  This is correct because (except for narrow cases) the compiler has to use dynamic dispatch for C++ virtual methods.   The good news here is that its dynamism is completely opt in, so C++ preserves all of the predictability, performance, and static-compilability of C while providing a higher level programming model.  If virtual methods are ever actually a performance problem, a C++ programmer has ways to deal with that, directly in their code.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. Java: Java makes nearly &quot;everything&quot; an object (no structs or other non-primitive value types), and all methods default to being “virtual” (in the C++ sense).  Java also introduces interfaces, which offer an added dimension on dynamic dispatch.  To cope with this, Java assumes a JIT compilation model, which can use dynamic behavior to de-virtualize the (almost always) monomorphic calls into checked direct calls.  This works out really well in practice, because JIT compilers are great at telling when a program with apparently very dynamic semantics actually have static semantics in practice (e.g. a dynamic call has a single receiver).  OTOH, since the compilation model assumes a JIT, this means that purely “AOT” static compilers (which have no profile information, no knowledge of class loaders, etc) necessarily produce inferior code.  It also means that Java doesn’t “scale down” well to small embedded systems that can’t support a JIT, like a bootloader.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 5) Objective-C: Objective-C provides a hybrid model which favors predictability due to its static compilation model (similar in some ways to C++).  The C-like constructs provide C-like performance, and the “messaging” constructs are never “devirtualized”, so they provide very predictable performance characteristics.  Because it is predictable, if the cost of a message send ever becomes an issue in practice, the programmer has many patterns to deal with it (including &quot;imp caching&quot;, and also including the ability to define the problem away by rewriting code in terms of C constructs).  The end result of this is that programmers write code which use C-level features where performance matters and dynamicism doesn’t, but use ObjC features where dynamicism is important or where performance doesn’t matter.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; While it would be possible to implement a JIT compiler for ObjC, I’d expect the wins to be low, because the “hot” code which may be hinging on these dynamic features is likely to already be optimized by hand.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 6) GoLang: From this narrow discussion and perspective, Go has a hybrid model that has similar characteristics to Objective-C 2013 (which introduced modules, but didn’t yet have generics).

C++: C++ is a step up from C in terms of introducing dynamism into the model with virtual functions.   Sadly, C++ also provides a hostile model for static optimizability - the existence of placement new prevents a lot of interesting devirtualization opportunities, and generally makes the compiler’s life difficult.  OTOH, like C, C++ provides a very predictable model: C++ programmers assume that C constructs are static, but virtual methods will be dynamically dispatched.  This is correct because (except for narrow cases) the compiler has to use dynamic dispatch for C++ virtual methods.   The good news here is that its dynamism is completely opt in, so C++ preserves all of the predictability, performance, and static-compilability of C while providing a higher level programming model.  If virtual methods are ever actually a performance problem, a C++ programmer has ways to deal with that, directly in their code.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. Java: Java makes nearly &quot;everything&quot; an object (no structs or other non-primitive value types), and all methods default to being “virtual” (in the C++ sense).  Java also introduces interfaces, which offer an added dimension on dynamic dispatch.  To cope with this, Java assumes a JIT compilation model, which can use dynamic behavior to de-virtualize the (almost always) monomorphic calls into checked direct calls.  This works out really well in practice, because JIT compilers are great at telling when a program with apparently very dynamic semantics actually have static semantics in practice (e.g. a dynamic call has a single receiver).  OTOH, since the compilation model assumes a JIT, this means that purely “AOT” static compilers (which have no profile information, no knowledge of class loaders, etc) necessarily produce inferior code.  It also means that Java doesn’t “scale down” well to small embedded systems that can’t support a JIT, like a bootloader.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5) Objective-C: Objective-C provides a hybrid model which favors predictability due to its static compilation model (similar in some ways to C++).  The C-like constructs provide C-like performance, and the “messaging” constructs are never “devirtualized”, so they provide very predictable performance characteristics.  Because it is predictable, if the cost of a message send ever becomes an issue in practice, the programmer has many patterns to deal with it (including &quot;imp caching&quot;, and also including the ability to define the problem away by rewriting code in terms of C constructs).  The end result of this is that programmers write code which use C-level features where performance matters and dynamicism doesn’t, but use ObjC features where dynamicism is important or where performance doesn’t matter.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While it would be possible to implement a JIT compiler for ObjC, I’d expect the wins to be low, because the “hot” code which may be hinging on these dynamic features is likely to already be optimized by hand.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6) GoLang: From this narrow discussion and perspective, Go has a hybrid model that has similar characteristics to Objective-C 2013 (which introduced modules, but didn’t yet have generics).  It assumes static compilation and provides a very predictable hybrid programming model.  Its func’s are statically dispatched, but its interfaces are dynamically dispatched.  It doesn’t provide guaranteed dynamic dispatch (or “classes&quot;) like ObjC, but it provides even more dynamic feautres in other areas (e.g. it requires a cycle-collecting garbage collector).  Its &quot;interface{}” type is pretty equivalent to “id” (e.g. all uses of it are dynamically dispatched or must be downcasted), and it encourages use of it in the same places that Objective-C does.  Go introduces checked downcasts, which introduce some run-time overhead, but also provide safety compared to Objective-C. Go thankfully introduces a replacement for the imperative constructs in C, which defines away a bunch of C problems that Objective-C inherited, and it certainly is prettier!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; … I can go on about other languages, but I have probably already gotten myself into enough trouble. :-)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With this as context, lets talk about Swift:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift is another case of a hybrid model: its semantics provide predictability between obviously static (structs, enums, and global funcs) and obviously dynamic (classes, protocols, and closures) constructs.  A focus of Swift (like Java and Javascript) is to provide an apparently simple programming model.  However, Swift also intentionally &quot;cheats&quot; in its global design by mixing in a few tricks to make the dynamic parts of the language optimizable by a static compiler in many common cases, without requiring profiling or other dynamic information..  For example, the Swift compiler can tell if methods in non-public classes are never overridden (and non-public is the default, for a lot of good reasons) - thus treating them as final.  This allows eliminating much of the overhead of dynamic dispatch without requiring a JIT.  Consider an “app”: because it never needs to have non-public classes, this is incredibly powerful - the design of the swift package manager extends this even further (in principle, not done yet) to external libraries. Further, Swift’s generics provide an a static performance model similar to C++ templates in release builds (though I agree we need to do more to really follow through on this) -- while Swift existentials (values of protocol type) provide a balance by giving a highly dynamic model.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The upshot of this is that Swift isn’t squarely in either of the static or dynamic camps: it aims to provide a very predictable performance model (someone writing a bootloader or firmware can stick to using Swift structs and have a simple guarantee of no dynamic overhead or runtime dependence) while also providing an expressive and clean high level programming model - simplifying learning and the common case where programmers don’t care to count cycles.  If anything, I’d say that Swift is an “opportunistic” language, in that it provides a very dynamic “default&quot; programming model, where you don’t have to think about the fact that a static compiler is able to transparently provide great performance - without needing the overhead of a JIT.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Finally, while it is possible that a JIT compiler might be interesting someday in the Swift space, if we do things right, it will never be “worth it” because programmers will have enough ability to reason about performance at their fingertips.  This means that there should be no Java or Javascript-magnitude &quot;performance delta&quot; sitting on the table waiting for a JIT to scoop up.  We’ll see how it works out long term, but I think we’re doing pretty well so far.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TL;DR: What I’m really getting at is that the old static vs dynamic trope is at the very least only half of the story.  You really need to include the compilation model and thus the resultant programmer model into the story, and the programmer model is what really matters, IMHO.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Chris<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160520/9633b5ab/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc3a9ea0c6c870343d9acb4ac3059cdc?s=50"></div><header><strong>Static Dispatch Pitfalls</strong> from <string>Matthew Johnson</string> &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt;<p>May 20, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On May 20, 2016, at 12:12 PM, Brandon Knope via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; On May 20, 2016, at 12:46 PM, David Waite via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On May 20, 2016, at 10:17 AM, Austin Zheng via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I almost want to propose forbidding methods in protocol extensions unless they&#39;re also a requirement in the protocol itself, but I don&#39;t think that would fly.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Austin<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Thats one option.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Think two separate developers - only who implements the protocol Foo and has an independent bar() method on their type, and one who writes an extension to Foo to add a bar method on it.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; bar() is not part of the protocol specification. the person implementing the type has no idea that others are expecting his bar() to meet particular requirements, just because it was declared in a protocol extension. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; How is this the case?

Hopefully the application developer has control over either the protocol definition, the extension, or the implementation of the protocol to try and resolve it.<br>&gt;&gt; - forbid protocol extensions adding methods - they can only implement existing methods<br>&gt;&gt; - If protocol implementations used “override” (or perhaps a better named keyword for covering this instance as well like “implement”), you could consider protocol extensions to extend the protocol definition more safely. You would also catch the case where the Protocol definition changed to include the same foo() method the implementing type defined independently, so the implementor can make sure their version of foo() meets the requirements the protocol gives.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; -DW<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On May 20, 2016, at 5:56 AM, Fabian Ehrentraud via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there&#39;s been a little discussion about static vs. dynamic dispatch on this mailing list, and there is a good post about the pitfalls when using attributes defined in extensions [1].<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Having run into this myself during development, is there a plan on how to reduce the pitfalls in future versions of Swift?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Fabian<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [1] https://developer.ibm.com/swift/2016/01/27/seven-swift-snares-how-to-avoid-them/ &lt;https://developer.ibm.com/swift/2016/01/27/seven-swift-snares-how-to-avoid-them/&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry, I understand and appreciate your pragmatism.

If you think of Swift as an OOP language with a powerful value-typed system added on, then you&#39;ll probably think Swift prefers virtual dispatch. If you think of Swift as a value-typed language with an OOP layer added, then you&#39;ll probably think Swift prefers static dispatch. In reality, Swift is a hybrid language and it uses different types of dispatch in different situations as appropriate.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (emphasis mine)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know that this is a bit philosophical, but let me suggest a “next level down” way to look at this.  Static and dynamic are *both* great after all, and if you’re looking to type-cast languages, you need to consider them both in light of their semantics, but also factor in their compilation strategy and the programmer model that they all provide.  Let me give you some examples, but keep in mind that this is a narrow view and just MHO:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. C: Static compilation model, static semantics.  While it does provide indirect function pointers, C does everything possible to punish their use (ever see the non-typedef&#39;d prototype for signal(3/7)?), and is almost always statically compiled.  It provides a very “static centric” programming model.  This is great in terms of predictability - it makes it trivial to “predict” what your code will look like at a machine level.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Javascript: Completely dynamic compilation model, completely dynamic semantics.  No one talks about statically compiling javascript, because the result of doing so would be a really really slow executable.  Javascript performance hinges on dynamic profile information to be able to efficiently execute a program.  This provides a very “dynamic centric” programming model, with no ability to understand how your code executes at a machine level.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3.

After reading so many emails I thought I might not be the only one craving a simple one page summary of what had been said so far.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160522/c6d3ea8d/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc3a9ea0c6c870343d9acb4ac3059cdc?s=50"></div><header><strong>Static Dispatch Pitfalls</strong> from <string>Matthew Johnson</string> &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt;<p>May 22, 2016 at 08:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>Sent from my iPad<br></p><p>On May 21, 2016, at 4:50 PM, Brent Royal-Gordon &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; Making them &#39;final&#39; causes problems with retroactive modeling.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Because of that issue, I had an attribute you could use to acknowledge conflicts and disable the error.

What do you do then? <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; If a method that really ought to be a protocol requirement isn&#39;t a requirement and you don&#39;t control the protocol, well you&#39;re pretty much out of luck even today. Any conforming type accessed via the protocol will use the less efficient extension method and nothing about Brent&#39;s proposal would make that worse or better.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Shadowing of the slow extension method doesn&#39;t remove the burden. It may make calling your fast implementation look nicer, but a less informed user of your type would unwittingly call the slower implementation if they access your type via the protocol. You could instead:<br>&gt;&gt; * come up with another name for your fast implementation; maybe the &quot;obvious&quot; name for the method is &quot;frobnicate&quot;--then name your method &quot;quicklyFrobnicate&quot;;<br>&gt;&gt; * or, decide you don&#39;t want to conform your type to a poorly designed protocol after all, instead retroactively modeling your type and other types of interest with a better designed protocol of your making.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Maybe you want the type to inter operate with code you don&#39;t control and in order to do that it must conform to the protocol.  And you don&#39;t want to obfuscate the interface to the concrete type because the protocol is poorly designed.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m not sure this is a reasonable set of demands. I understand a protocol to be a contract.  If you decide to conform to a poorly designed protocol, you *should* have a poorly designed concrete type.<br></p><p>This is crazy.  If a protocol happens to place a method in an extension rather than making it a default implementation of a requirement and I want to conform to it does not mean my concrete type should have be poorly designed.  Sure, when the 3rd party type uses my concrete type via the interface of its protocol it will not receive the benefits of a higher performance implementation.  But maybe interoperability is more important than the highest performance possible.<br></p><p>&gt; That is the purpose of a protocol, to provide certain guarantees, be they wise or unwise. To me, it&#39;s a bug rather than a feature to support papering over poor protocol design when conforming to a protocol, which also forces the poor design to be exposed only when accessing your type through that protocol. In the end, you don&#39;t have a well-designed type; your type is instead simultaneously well and poorly designed!<br></p><p>When it comes to interoperating with code you do not control you get what you get.  You have to work with it one way or another.  What I am saying is that the language should not artificially limit our options here.<br></p><p>&gt;  <br>&gt;  Conforming to the protocol *is not* the primary reason your type exists - conformance is used only for the purpose of using your type with a specific piece of third party code.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; You *could* wrap your type for the purpose of this conformance.  This is what a Brent alluded to.  But it requires boilerplate and a bunch of conversion operations.  This is not just annoying, it could also be complex enough to lead to bugs.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt; If you control the protocol but want to retroactively model types you do not control this assumes you are willing to design your protocol around those types.  What if one of those types happens to implement a method that should not be a requirement of the protocol for one reason or another, but will be implemented as an extension method.  What do you do then?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sure I quite understand when this arises. Surely, by construction, if you wish to retroactively model types, you are willing to design your protocol around them. What else could it mean to retroactively model existing types? Can you give a concrete example where during retroactively modeling you simply have no choice but to name an extension method using a name that it is shadowed by a conforming type?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m not saying you have *no choice*.  But again, conforming the one problematic type is not the primary purpose for which you are designing the protocol.  You know the shadowing method will not present any problems for your design.  Why should you be forced to design your protocol around this?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Because, again, a protocol is a contract. If you&#39;re retroactively modeling many well designed types and one poorly designed type, the lowest common denominator is a poorly designed protocol. That *should* be the result, no?<br></p><p>It all depends on the types and the protocol.  Protocols often represent a small subset of the total interface and functionality of a type.  <br></p><p>The fact that the type may happen to use a name for a method that matches a name you would like to use in an extension to your protocol does not necessarily mean either is poorly designed.<br></p><p>&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt; And of course there are cases where you do not control either.   Some people write code with a lot of 3rd party dependencies these days (not my style, but pretty common).  This is not a trivial concern.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; You are saying that it would be possible for a protocol extension in one dependency to conflict with a conforming type in another? This issue can be avoided if enforcement of non-shadowing by the compiler is such that when neither conforming type nor protocol extension is under your control everything continues to work as-is.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; So you would still allow the developer to declare the conformance without error?  This means that developers still need to understand the shadowing behavior but it is pushed even further into a dark corner of the language with more special case rules that must be learned to understand when you might run into it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; No, I would forbid declaring any such conformance in code the developer controls. If you control the conforming type and it contains a method name that clashes with a protocol extension method, you would be forbidden from declaring conformance without renaming your clashing method. In fact, I&#39;m beginning to wonder if protocol extension methods on protocols outside the same module should be internally scoped.<br></p><p>In this case you *don’t* control the conforming type.  You want to declare conformance for a type that is in a 3rd party library.  You said when neither is under your control you would leave things as-is.  Today you can declare conformance without error.  Would you still allow that?<br></p><p>&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; (And btw, &#39;final&#39; in this proposal is not exactly, because when combined with @incoherent the methods are not actually &#39;final&#39; - there is a necessary escape hatch).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no particular reason you couldn&#39;t allow similar annotated shadowing of `final` methods on classes; they would have basically the same semantics as you get here, where if a piece of code knows it&#39;s working with the subclass you get subclass semantics, but otherwise you get superclass ones. I do not claim this is a good idea. :^)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Second, we should require annotation of methods in protocol extensions that are not default implementation of requirements.  Maybe &#39;shadowable&#39; or &#39;staticdispatch&#39;?  These are awkward, but so is the behavior and they describe it better than anything else I&#39;ve seen so far (maybe we can do better though).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think `shadowable` makes sense here; that doesn&#39;t acknowledge a limitation, which is what we&#39;re trying to do here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I continue to wish we hadn&#39;t taken `static` for statically-dispatched type methods. But I lost that argument years before swift-evolution became a thing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t like &#39;nondynamic&#39; both because it is not aligned with the meaning of &#39;dynamic&#39; and also because it only says what the behavior *is not* rather than what the behavior *is*.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I do understand what you mean here. Unfortunately, the word &quot;virtual&quot; in a keyword makes me break out in hives, and I&#39;m not sure what else we might base it on.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This is why I selected `final` in my proposal. `final` is desperately close to the actual semantic here, far closer than anything else in the language.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; How about `nonoverridable`? That said, I agree with earlier comments that training-wheel annotations probably aren&#39;t the way to go. Maybe, as you suggest above, just don&#39;t allow shadowing at all.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, ‘nonoverridable’ doesn’t really make sense because you don’t ‘override’ protocol requirements.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; You don&#39;t override protocol requirements, but you do override their default implementations, whereas you cannot &#39;override&#39; statically dispatched extension methods. Within a protocol extension, there are methods that are overridable by conforming types (i.e. default implementations of protocol requirements) and methods that are not (i.e. statically dispatched non-requirements).<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; --<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Brent Royal-Gordon<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Architechies<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160523/962b3e85/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/60dcb74d816e29b2aa6b9c0b5969670e?s=50"></div><header><strong>Static Dispatch Pitfalls</strong> from <string>Xiaodi Wu</string> &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;<p>May 23, 2016 at 03:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Mon, May 23, 2016 at 12:13 PM, Matthew Johnson &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt;<br>wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;<br>&gt; On May 23, 2016, at 10:50 AM, Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Mon, May 23, 2016 at 6:58 AM, Matthew Johnson &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt;<br>&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Sent from my iPad<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; On May 22, 2016, at 11:55 PM, Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; On Sun, May 22, 2016 at 11:20 PM, Matthew Johnson &lt;matthew at anandabits.com<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On May 22, 2016, at 4:22 PM, Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Sun, May 22, 2016 at 3:38 PM, Brent Royal-Gordon via swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The proposal is well thought out and makes a valiant attempt at<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; handling all of the issues necessary.

There would be no such justification with classes.  IMO `final` should mean final, period.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Second, we should require annotation of methods in protocol extensions that are not default implementation of requirements.  Maybe &#39;shadowable&#39; or &#39;staticdispatch&#39;?  These are awkward, but so is the behavior and they describe it better than anything else I&#39;ve seen so far (maybe we can do better though).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I don&#39;t think `shadowable` makes sense here; that doesn&#39;t acknowledge a limitation, which is what we&#39;re trying to do here.<br></p><p>Sure, I admit it’s not great.
