The proposal has been *accepted*, pending more implementation experience:  This proposal was very positively received by the community, and garnered a lot of feedback (which has already been incorporated into the proposal).  This proposal has significant implementation complexity, but the work to build it is nearing completion.  When this lands, there is some risk that weâ€™ll need to revise the design in small ways due to unanticipated effects, but the core team believes it is the right overall design to aim for.<br></p><p>Thank you to Joe Groff for driving the design and discussion around this feature, as well as many people who are contributing to the implementation and design effort.<br></p><p>-Chris Lattner<br>Review Manager<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
