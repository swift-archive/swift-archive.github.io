However I agree with Brent, this<br>is a feature that I use often and I am unsure whether you&#39;re<br>underestimating its use.<br></p><p>I think I would be happy with your proposal if:<br></p><p>   - Brackets around generic parens lists differentiates single and<br>   multiple parameters (as you discussed with me).<br>   - A temporary function was introduced to provide backwards compatibility<br>   (in a generic setting), until a more thoroughly thought-out proposal is<br>   made.<br></p><p>Otherwise, I think that this is a great proposal, but I&#39;m afraid my<br>evaluation is as follows:<br></p><p> • What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>-1<br></p><p>It&#39;s a necessary change, it removes ambiguity and a gotcha that exercises<br>functionality most users won&#39;t directly take advantage of. However, it does<br>not sufficiently cover the timeline or handling of lost functionality. I<br>feel like it breaks an entire class of existing clear, concise, and robust<br>functions. It also hinders and practical exploration of generic function<br>utilities in Swift.<br></p><p>  • Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change<br>to Swift?<br>Yes<br></p><p> • Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>Yes and no, I think it fits well in that it reduces surprises and removes<br>ambiguity. However I think that it will put a stop to many Swift libraries,<br>current and future, that use splat to provide function utilities. I feel<br>like this should be a yes, but perhaps the proposal is incomplete in this<br>regard.<br></p><p> • If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature,<br>how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>As with Brent, I&#39;ve used other languages with the functionality being<br>removed and I&#39;ve found it extremely useful. The lost functionality can<br>reduce a lot of boilerplate, in many cases making code much more clear,<br>concise, and robust. The lost functionality allows the complexity of<br>generalised functions to abstracted, a user need not know how it works, but<br>can benefit from the added clarity and utility.<br></p><p> • How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading,<br>or an in-depth study?<br>An in-depth study.<br></p><p>I&#39;ve explored what could and could not work after this proposal, in code.<br>I&#39;m using the functionality this proposal removes in production code. I&#39;ve<br>experimented with a non-generic solution to splatting, and the limitations<br>it creates (in a generic context). I&#39;ve also extrapolated from how the<br>removed functionality could be expanded with well designed and thought out<br>language support, and created a proposal (I hope) to pave the way for that.<br></p><p>On Tue, Feb 9, 2016 at 3:01 AM, Joe Groff &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;<br>&gt; On Feb 5, 2016, at 3:54 PM, Andrew Bennett &lt;cacoyi at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hi Joe,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I&#39;m sorry to bring up the &quot;common point of confusion&quot;, but I&#39;d like a<br>&gt; little more clarification to help me review :).

I won&#39;t repeat the details here, but suffice it to say, I could work around its absence if I had to but my code would be worse for it.<br></p><p>I do agree that the problems described in the proposal are real, but I think the feature&#39;s value is underestimated, and I think the proposed solution maximizes migration difficulties.<br></p><p>I don&#39;t agree with the proposal&#39;s blithe assertion that tuple splat &quot;is purely a sugar feature&quot;. Tuple splat allows you to write generic functions that work with a function of any arity; in fact, it allows *most* generic functions to work in this fashion, even built-in ones like `map` which are designed for unary functions. Even something so simple as a function composition operator is impossible to write without it. In short, you *can* work around its absence, but only by distorting your code and obscuring its purpose—and to a far greater extent than this proposal complains about tuple splat doing.<br></p><p>Finally—and perhaps most importantly, because we&#39;re setting a precedent here—the proposal seems very concerned with breaking code now rather than later. However, if the feature is removed without replacement, and then a replacement is added in a later version, that means people using this feature will have to change their code twice: once to remove implicit tuple splat, and again to adopt its eventual replacement. And if the fix-it essentially involves creating a closure to wrap the call, it seems unlikely that removing that closure can be fix-it guided, so the second change will have to be done manually.<br></p><p>Thus, for those using the feature, removing it in Swift 3 and re-adding it in a later version is *more* disruptive than replacing it in Swift 4 or some other future release cycle, while for those *not* using the feature, both strategies cause the same amount of disruption (none).<br></p><p>It&#39;s one thing to remove features we don&#39;t want to keep, like the `++` operator, or disable only-the-test-suite-will-notice corner cases due to implementation limits, like the curried super calls. It&#39;s another thing to remove features we think are a good idea, but want to redesign at some unspecified future date.<br></p><p>Like preemptive war, preemptive feature removal is not an action to be taken lightly. If we want to remove it and replace it, fine. If we want to remove it and *not* replace it, let&#39;s talk about that. But removing it and maybe replacing it eventually, but probably not in this release cycle, is essentially the most disruptive possible way this could be handled.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes, but I don&#39;t think the change that should be made is to simply delete the feature and defer any decisions on its replacement.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>In the sense that we seem to be seeking a stronger separation between tuples and parameters, yes. In the sense that Swift attempts to make higher-order functions practical, no.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>I&#39;ve used languages with a variety of parameter type arrangements, and I&#39;ve always found splatting very useful. I found it useful in Swift, too.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>A full reading of the proposal, participation in the preliminary discussion thread, review of my codebases to look at where I had used it. I have not really looked at the implementation issues, but other than that, I think I have a pretty good understanding of this proposal.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/743ea9b8e49fa6a8390b2f4b3e1a588f?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0029 Remove implicit tuple splat behavior from function applications</strong> from <string>Jerome ALVES</string> &lt;j.alves at me.com&gt;<p>February  9, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>Hello,<br></p><p>I use this feature to make generic &quot;weak target actions&quot; like this :<br></p><p><br>func weakTarget&lt;T, S: AnyObject&gt;(target: S, action: S -&gt; (T -&gt; Void)) -&gt; (T -&gt; Void) {<br>    return { [weak target] (input: T) -&gt; Void in<br>        guard let target = target else { return }<br>        return action(target)(input)<br>    }<br>}<br></p><p>class Target {<br>    init() {}<br>    func printHello(firstName: String, lastName: String) {<br>        print(&quot;Hello \(firstName) \(lastName) !&quot;)<br>    }<br>}<br></p><p>class Receiver {<br>    init() {}<br>    var printSomething: ((String, String) -&gt; Void)? = nil<br>}<br></p><p>var aTarget: Target? = Target()<br>let aReceiver = Receiver()<br></p><p>aReceiver.printSomething = weakTarget(aTarget!, action: Target.sayHello)<br></p><p>aReceiver.printSomething?(&quot;Jérôme&quot;, &quot;Alves&quot;) // =&gt; &quot;Hello Jérôme Alves !&quot;<br></p><p>a = nil<br></p><p>aReceiver.printSomething?(&quot;Jérôme&quot;, &quot;Alves&quot;) // =&gt; aReceiver.printSomething still has a value, but it does nothing<br></p><p><br>As you can see, if you call weakFunc() with a func which has multiple arguments, the T generic will be a tuple and I guess this is thanks to this &quot;implicit tuple splat&quot; feature but I&#39;m not sure.<br>So can someone enlighten me ?
