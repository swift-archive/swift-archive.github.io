This is just an interim solution until we can get better support on the linux side from the compiler to enable implicit conversion between object types and struct types (which is handled by the protocol _ObjectiveCBridgeable). The change adds a new protocol `_ObjectTypeBridgeable` that still has the functionality so that once the compiler can support this feature on linux targets we can re-enable implicit conversions.<br></p><p>I would strongly suggest that anyone currently developing build against this change to ensure that any implicit conversions are made explicitly.<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
