There are many strong reasons<br>to believe that&#39;s true, but we have some work ahead of us in order to<br>demonstrate it conclusively.<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Making some RawRepresentable things bridge to ObjC as their raw value</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>October  2, 2016 at 07:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Oct 2, 2016, at 3:46 PM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Do you mind providing some color on this design?

Obviously this is a mere style concern and should be ignored if there are good reasons to use the other design, but it seems to me that it deserves at least a little bit of weight.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
