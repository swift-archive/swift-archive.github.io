A subset of the<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; proposal is *accepted, with modifications* for Swift 3.  This proposal<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; included four new additions to the standard library:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sequence.prefix(while:) &amp; Sequence.drop(while:) - These are *accepted* as specified in revision<br>3 of the proposal.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I know the review is over and all, but…<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Chris brought to my attention an idea that I liked, and asked me to post<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; here about it.  Specifically, the argument label “where:” would probably<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; be better than “while:”.  “While” makes it sound to me like it&#39;s going<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to take a nullary predicate and be much more active.  But it&#39;s hard to<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; love<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;      s.drop(where: { $0 &gt; 1 })<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;      s.drop { $0 &gt; 1 }<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; because it makes it sound like a general filtering operation.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Therefore, I&#39;d much rather see<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;        s.droppingPrefix(where: {$0 &gt; 1})<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; <br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Using &quot;where:&quot; has a very high potential for confusion, because<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;where&quot; makes it sound like it runs the predicate against every<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; single element, whereas &quot;while&quot; makes it clear that it stops<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; evaluating elements once the predicate returns false. Or in other<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; words, `drop(where: predicate)` looks like it should be equivalent<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; to `filter({ !predicate($0) })`.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Oops, I read your message too fast and missed the fact that you<br>&gt; &gt; changed the function name too in the very last line.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; And made the exact point that you made :-)<br></p><p>Indeed. My apologies, I was trying to get through my email too fast and ended up skimming too much.<br></p><p>&gt; &gt; If we switched to `droppingPrefix(where:)` then we&#39;d need to change `dropFirst(_:)` as well.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Yes, as I noted in my response to Erica, I would like to see some more design<br>&gt; coherence in this whole area.  I think<br>&gt; <br>&gt;           xs.dropFirst()  =&gt;  xs.droppingFirst()<br>&gt;           xs.dropFirst(3) =&gt; xs.droppingPrefix(ofMaxLength: 3)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m not wedded to “dropping,” especially because it has other<br>&gt; connotations.  Dmitri, Max, and I kicked around a bunch of other<br>&gt; possibilities, e.g.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;           sansPrefix<br>&gt;           withoutPrefix<br></p><p>If we do rename this, I&#39;m partial to basing it off of the word &quot;skip&quot;, e.g. skippingPrefix(), since that&#39;s<br>similar to &quot;drop&quot; but doesn&#39;t have the connotation of possibly mutating the receiver. That said, having a<br>first argument label &quot;ofMaxLength:&quot; seems overly verbose. Don&#39;t forget that not everybody has the<br>benefit of Xcode code completion when writing Swift code.<br></p><p>&gt; Anyway, we can&#39;t do all of that by the seat of our pants.  I personally<br>&gt; wouldn&#39;t want to go any further than s.dropPrefix(where: ...)  without a<br>&gt; new proposal/review.<br></p><p>Agreed, anything beyond that needs a full review. So back to the suggestion at hand.<br></p><p>I wrote up a whole long explanation for why I still think &quot;while&quot; is the better choice, and then I thought<br>about how this impacts `prefix(...:)` instead of `drop(...:)`, and in this context &quot;where:&quot; makes more<br>sense. `prefix(while:)` turns &quot;prefix&quot; from a noun into a verb, and the verb meaning of &quot;prefix&quot; is not at<br>all what we&#39;re doing with this operation. But `prefix(where:)` is still a noun and makes sense. And of<br>course if we have `prefix(where:)` then it&#39;s a bit odd to have `drop(while:)`, so we&#39;d have to go with<br>`drop(where:)` or `dropPrefix(where:)`. So I guess I&#39;ve now convinced myself while writing this email<br>that &quot;where:&quot; is the right choice :D<br></p><p>That said, given that we already have `dropFirst(_:)`, maybe we should go with `dropFirst(where:)`<br>instead of `dropPrefix(where:)`? Otherwise it&#39;s a bit odd to have both &quot;dropFirst&quot; and &quot;dropPrefix&quot; as<br>names. Admittedly, this same argument applies to the existing `drop(while:)` name too, and I don&#39;t have a<br>great explanation for that beyond the fact that I had a vague idea that dropFirst(_:) might be renamed to<br>drop(first:), though that can&#39;t actually happen because having both dropFirst() and drop(first:) is<br>hugely confusing, and it doesn&#39;t make sense to rename dropFirst() to drop().<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160608/56edfc70/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
