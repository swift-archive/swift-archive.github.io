It&#39;s potentially useful to have a way to suppress this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rule and get a normal construction, but there are several other ways<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of getting that effect, such as explicitly typing the literal argument<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (e.g. writing &quot;A(Int(B))&quot;).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A conditional conformance counts as a declared conformance even if the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; generic arguments are known to not satisfy the conditional<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conformance.  This permits the applicability of the rule to be decided<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without having to first decide the type arguments, which greatly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simplifies the type-checking problem (and may be necessary for<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; soundness; I didn&#39;t explore this in depth, but it certainly feels like<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a very nasty sort of dependence).  We could potentially weaken this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for cases where A is a direct type reference with bound parameters,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; e.g. Foo&lt;Int&gt;([]) or the same with a typealias, but I think there&#39;s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some benefit from having a simpler specification, both for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; implementation and for the explicability of the model.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; John.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -- <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -Dave<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d53b7c5f9b5f5557b9082face9b632a0?s=50"></div><header><strong>Proposal: &#39;T(literal)&#39; should construct T using the appropriate literal protocol if possible</strong> from <string>Dave Abrahams</string> &lt;dabrahams at apple.com&gt;<p>June  8, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>on Wed Jun 08 2016, John McCall &lt;rjmccall-AT-apple.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; On Jun 7, 2016, at 4:25 PM, Dave Abrahams &lt;dabrahams at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; on Tue Jun 07 2016, John McCall &lt;rjmccall-AT-apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 5, 2016, at 5:18 PM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on Thu Jun 02 2016, John McCall &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The official way to build a literal of a specific type is to write the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; literal in an explicitly-typed context, like so:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   let x: UInt16 = 7<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   let x = 7 as UInt16<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nonetheless, programmers often try the following:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   UInt16(7)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, this does not attempt to construct the value using the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appropriate literal protocol; it instead performs overload resolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using the standard rules, i.e. considering only single-argument<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unlabelled initializers of a type which conforms to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IntegerLiteralConvertible.
