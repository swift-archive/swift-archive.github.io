I must say that I am very happy for what has been discussed, the<br>&gt; more because of what Swift will *not* become than of what it will become.<br>&gt; ;-)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; OK. In Objective-C and other languages we have “.PCH” files or some kind<br>&gt; of “prefix headers”. In Swift we do not have header files (thankfully), but<br>&gt; there is no simple way to “pre-import” modules in a way that all source<br>&gt; files can “see” them without the need of a big list of “imports” at the<br>&gt; beginning of each file, every single time. I know that the “.PCH-like” it<br>&gt; is not a good practice in most cases, but I believe it would be interesting<br>&gt; in some other cases.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Today we have some kind of this functionality when using bridging headers,<br>&gt; but this is in fact a side effect provided by the interoperability with<br>&gt; Objective-C. I am suggesting a pure Swift version of this functionality.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I do not know how we can implement this in Swift, but since we now have<br>&gt; the special case of “Package.swift” to handling SPM things, maybe something<br>&gt; like “Preimport.swift” or “Modules.swift” or something better than these<br>&gt; names (I do not like them…) with the intention of saying: “Hi, compiler!<br>&gt; I&#39;m listing here the modules that are common to the whole project, OK? Can<br>&gt; you take them into account when compiling each project source code file<br>&gt; from now?&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What do you think?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Regards,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Vanderlei Martinelli<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160130/d7a25fbb/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
