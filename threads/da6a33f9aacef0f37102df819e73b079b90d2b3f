I just wanted to clear a few things as I can find no definitive information online to formally back up what I say.<br> <br>In my summary, I say something along these lines:<br> <br>“A reference to a function can be likened to a reference to a data structure, and in many ways is similar to an instance of a class. There is immutable program code, and state, some of which might be mutable. Therefore, in a multithreaded environment, you need to treat any function that captures and mutates data in the same way as shared mutable state in order to avoid creating race conditions”<br> <br>·   Is there a description of how a Swift function type is structured in memory? <br>·   Is it ‘reasonable’ to liken a function to a class instance in this way? (given this is only supposed to be an analogy). <br>·   Do I assume correctly about the dangers of capturing data in multithreaded code?<br> <br>Cheers<br> <br>Nick<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20160727/da6a2b3f/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
