The proposal is *accepted* for Swift 3.<br></p><p>The feedback on this proposal was strongly positive from the community and core team.  Some concerns were raised (e.g. about possible interaction with the future &quot;generalized existentials&quot; feature) but further examination turned up that they were at issue regardless of whether this feature is accepted.  The core team agrees that this syntactic structure allows a more natural and beautiful way to structure complex generic constraints, and that “where” clauses should be considered secondary to the primary signature of the declaration (e.g. func, class, etc) in question.<br></p><p>Thank you to David Hart, Robert Widmann, and Pyry Jahkola for proposing this!  I filed SR-1561 to track implementation of this feature.<br></p><p>-Chris Lattner<br>Review Manager<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
