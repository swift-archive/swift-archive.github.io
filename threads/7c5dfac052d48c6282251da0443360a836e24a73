It seems to me that in conditional binding with conditional casting, you&#39;re asking the compiler to do not one but *two* magical things:<br></p><p>1. Apply what *looks* like assignment (I have a similar issue with if case/guard case) but is actually something else<br>2. Apply what *looks* like conditional casting but which magically passes Any? through to T?, not T??<br></p><p>I handwave this (but just the moment) and say &quot;it&#39;s not really an assignment, so it&#39;s not really a conditional cast&quot;. Jack asked me to bring this discussion over to Swift Evolution and ask the greater community whether Swift is doing these things right, and if not, how it should fix them. <br></p><p>Where I stand:<br></p><p>* If there&#39;s going to be magic, it should be documented (and it is not) in the Swift Programming Language<br>* If there&#39;s going to be magic, it should work for T?, not just Any?<br>* I&#39;d rather there not be magic here<br></p><p>-- E<br>p.s. I&#39;d also rather that if-case/guard-case would use &quot;:&quot; like in switch statements not &quot;=&quot;, but no one seems to be responding to that thread, dagnabit<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20161009/7c5d4a73/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8aa3a9da9a32d3e98805b4a5409e4cee?s=50"></div><header><strong>Conditional casting and conditional binding: Wierd edge case or flawed design</strong> from <string>Anton Zhilin</string> &lt;antonyzhilin at gmail.com&gt;<p>October 10, 2016 at 03:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>A quick fix:<br></p><p>guard let value = dict[&quot;Key&quot;].map({ $0 as NSString }) {<br>    use(value)<br>}<br></p><p>Current behavior is quite logical: main purpose of as? is to perform casts,<br>which are not guaranteed to succeed.
