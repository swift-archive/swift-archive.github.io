It could be convenient to be able to just depend on a branch,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but the meaning of depending on a branch changes over time as more commits<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come in. Is it harmful to allow packages to depend on something that&#39;s not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an identified commit?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         – Note that we have yet to design our security story (<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/PackageManagerCommunityProposal.md#security-and-signing);<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what we settle on there might require dependencies to be specified as a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; specific tagged commit, so that it can be signed.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; – Should it be possible to override a package&#39;s dependency to use a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different branch, without having to modify and commit a change to that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; package&#39;s Package.swift?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; – We may want to design a way for packages to support different<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; versions of the Swift language, as the language continues to change – e.g.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a branch of the package for the last released swift vs the current under<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; development swift snapshot.

I think there are two problems this proposal is tackling, and it may be worth to call them out separately:<br></p><p>1. It may be necessary to point at an alternate &quot;namespace&quot; for pulling a dependency from (branch, etc.), because swiftpm support is not in the mainline.<br></p><p>2. It is useful when developing packages and hierarchies of packages to be able to point to non-tagged commits.<br></p><p>The reason I think it makes sense to separate these is that #1 is a problem which applies to all of the packages in a dependency tree. For example, some popular Swift projects may want to add support for swiftpm + Swift 2.2, but they can&#39;t put that into their mainline, or their mainline tags. One natural way to support that use case would be to have &quot;namespace tags&quot;, like &quot;swiftpm-1.2&quot;. That is something which deserves its own proposal, if anyone wants to tackle it.<br></p><p>For #2, I think we should encourage a usage model where the &quot;Package.swift is the thing you should check in&quot;. We want to always encourage people to write manifests appropriate for sharing. The need to *override* the behavior strikes me as a mostly local issue, which should be addressed by a mechanism outside of the Package.swift.<br></p><p>Max and I just discussed this briefly, and came up with what I think is a pretty good strategy here:<br></p><p>1. Instead of tackling this problem in the manifest, start by coming up with a proposal for supporting &quot;lock files&quot;. Something like:<br> - Support a Packages.lock file in the root folder.<br> - Define a simple syntax for associating package URLs with locked versions.<br> - Implement package manager support for using that file.<br></p><p>Once that is in place, you will already be able to use that file to solve this particular problem (you can just edit the lock file to point at a branch or at a commit). We already know we need &quot;lock file&quot; support, so this is also handy in that it is solving this problem with a generally useful feature.<br></p><p>2. Max had a great suggestion for how &quot;locking&quot; should work:<br> - &quot;swift build --lock&quot; (or however it is spelled) would simply create the .lock file based on the current state of your Packages tree.<br></p><p>This simple idea gives a great workflow for developing packages: you start by declaring your dependencies in your Package.swift, you use `swift build` to pull them down for you, then you start hacking on them (in your local checkout) to get the changes you need, iterating using `swift build --lock &amp;&amp; swift build`, and then once you have something that works you can move to pushing those changes back and you already have the right .lock file<br></p><p>That is another feature to be proposed and implemented, but I think can be decoupled from the basic initial Packages.lock support.<br></p><p>What do you think?<br></p><p> - Daniel<br></p><p>&gt; On Dec 15, 2015, at 6:09 AM, Ankit Agarwal via swift-build-dev &lt;swift-build-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I think even the source URL will also work on tags <br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Tue, Dec 15, 2015 at 1:33 PM, Kostiantyn Koval &lt;konstantin.koval1 at gmail.com &lt;mailto:konstantin.koval1 at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; There is a plan to add ability to support fetching packages by url for development purpose described here<br>&gt; Importing Dependencies by Source URL form &quot;PackageManagerCommunityProposal&quot; <br>&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/PackageManagerCommunityProposal.md#importing-dependencies-by-source-url &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/PackageManagerCommunityProposal.md#importing-dependencies-by-source-url&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Kostiantyn<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On 14 Dec 2015, at 22:36, Kostiantyn Koval &lt;konstantin.koval1 at gmail.com &lt;mailto:konstantin.koval1 at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; +1 for adding this.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Ability to point to commit instead of a tag is crucial. <br>&gt;&gt; Often happens that a bug was fixed in the depended library but it wasn&#39;t released/tagged.<br>&gt;&gt; As well it helps during development.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Kostiantyn<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On 14 Dec 2015, at 20:14, Marc Knaup via swift-build-dev &lt;swift-build-dev at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-build-dev at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; +1 since I had to do exactly that a couple of times with CocoaPods.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; There were issue in third party Pods which were fixed in a specific commit or branch but the official release would still take a while.

Max had a great suggestion for how &quot;locking&quot; should work:<br>&gt;  - &quot;swift build --lock&quot; (or however it is spelled) would simply create the<br>&gt; .lock file based on the current state of your Packages tree.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This simple idea gives a great workflow for developing packages: you start<br>&gt; by declaring your dependencies in your Package.swift, you use `swift build`<br>&gt; to pull them down for you, then you start hacking on them (in your local<br>&gt; checkout) to get the changes you need, iterating using `swift build --lock<br>&gt; &amp;&amp; swift build`, and then once you have something that works you can move<br>&gt; to pushing those changes back and you already have the right .lock file<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; To add more detail here, I propose that, initially you `swift build`:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     $ swift build<br>&gt;     $ cd Packages<br>&gt;     $ ls<br>&gt;     FooBar-1.2.3<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Then you can step into Packages/FooBar-1.2.3 and change the branch:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     $ git checkout mybranch<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Then build against that branch<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     $ swift build<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Now, to ensure consumers of your terminal-package or other members of your<br>&gt; team are using the same packages as you, you need to commit the lock file:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     $ git add ../../Packages.lock<br>&gt;     $ git commit -m Lock against devbranch for FooBar<br>&gt;     $ git push<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Any .lock files that are cloned into dependencies are *ignored*. If a<br>&gt; dependency depends on a branch of a package they should specify to the<br>&gt; end-user that they will need to lock against that branch in their README.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The justification here is: dependency graphs are fragile, and introducing<br>&gt; additional fragility should be avoided directly as part of our design going<br>&gt; forward.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Now, we can add a convenience command line to do the above steps all in<br>&gt; one, but exposing and documenting the mechanism transparently in the above<br>&gt; manner offers consumers of swiftpm power and flexibility.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In addition the above workflow exposes a simple method for fixing issues<br>&gt; in your dependencies directly without the need for convoluted tooling.<br>&gt; Simply step into your Packages directory, make your changes and change the<br>&gt; remote to your own fork, then lock.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Part of the proposal should thus make swiftpm emit warnings for modified<br>&gt; packages without changes that are committed or pushed remotely. We don’t<br>&gt; want people to accidentally push non-atomic changes to their dependency<br>&gt; graph resulting in their teams not being able to build their projects.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Max<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-build-dev mailing list<br>&gt; swift-build-dev at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-build-dev<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-build-dev mailing list<br>&gt; swift-build-dev at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-build-dev<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br></p><p><br>-- <br>Ankit<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev/attachments/20151219/14e75116/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ae51ca494b37cc270597830da66f089f?s=50"></div><header><strong>Proposal: Git Branch and ref support for dependencies in Swift Package Manager</strong> from <string>Max Howell</string> &lt;max.howell at apple.com&gt;<p>December 19, 2015 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Dec 19, 2015, at 8:41 AM, Ankit Agarwal &lt;ankit at ankit.im&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Considering all the suggestions so far I am thinking of the following workflow :<br>&gt; <br>&gt; .lock file will contain all the resolved dependencies in some simple format containing resolved version number or commit hash in case of untagged package.  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1.

which is due to be implemented after xcodeproj lands (which is done).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; My rationale is: it impacts this proposal<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -----------<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I would like to suggest that the lockfile be placed as so:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     Packages/Lockfile<br>&gt;<br>&gt; For me this fulfills the best of both worlds: it no longer seems to be a<br>&gt; UNIX-style lockfile for the Package.swift file *and* it more clearly shows<br>&gt; what precisely is being locked while continuing the perhaps unwise<br>&gt; tradition of naming the file a “lockfile”<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -----------<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I would like to propose that initially the method that is used for<br>&gt; altering branches, origins and pinning versions is not given an explicit<br>&gt; CLI UI and instead the user must use explicit git commands in their<br>&gt; Packages directory to set the “locks”.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The benefit here is that the process we are using is transparent, which<br>&gt; allows developers more power over this feature and enables greater<br>&gt; understanding over what happens.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Once the modifications are made the lock file can be regenerated by<br>&gt; executing a command (TBD). Trying to run swift-build with modifications<br>&gt; without first generating the lock results in a prominent warning, or<br>&gt; perhaps even an error (TBD).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -----------<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I would like the propose that any local changes to cloned packages that<br>&gt; are NOT pinned to a commit are diff’d and the diff be embedded in the<br>&gt; lockfile. This ensures that we:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 1) Encourage users to edit, fix and improve their packages<br>&gt; 2) Their changes get checked in and thus other people using the Package<br>&gt; absolutely will get these changes without them having to explicitly publish<br>&gt; their changes somewhere accessible to their whole team.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Dec 14, 2015, at 10:43 AM, Ankit Agarwal &lt;ankit at ankit.im&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hi,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;

* While developing packages, one would want to point a package that uses<br>&gt; the package to a develop branch (eg: Developing Foo package, Bar uses Foo<br>&gt; and wants to point Foo dep to develop branch)<br>&gt; * One would want to point to his own fork but not create a release while<br>&gt; developing/testing (eg: Fork a library not compatible with SPM to make it<br>&gt; compatible)<br>&gt; * One wants to point to some commit but doesn&#39;t have a branch/tag created<br>&gt;
