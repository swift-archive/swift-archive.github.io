The whole point of a sequence is to iterate over it. Yes, if you have a destructive sequence and you iterate over it multiple times it&#39;s not going to work right, but I don&#39;t see find() as having any higher risk of doing this than any of the other methods that iterate over the sequence.<br></p><p>Not only that, but I actually find the find() method to be most useful when used with Sequence.
