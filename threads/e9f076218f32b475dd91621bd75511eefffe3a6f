Personally I&#39;m<br>ambivalent about many of the removals, but as I understand the rationale it is<br>mostly about eliminating some error-prone `C&#39; heritage, and that makes<br>sense to me.<br></p><p>&gt; Consider for a moment that Swift-Evolution was OOP-dominated<br>&gt; and therefore happily removing closures/lambdas protocols, <br>&gt; because they have never used it or even do not understand it?<br>&gt; would you accept that?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (protocols in Swift are cool btw, as for me, <br>&gt; I take the best of both worlds whether FP and/or OOP) <br></p><p>Protocols have nothing in particular to do with FP either.<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
