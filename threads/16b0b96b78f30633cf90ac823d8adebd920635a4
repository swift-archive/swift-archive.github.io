Contrary to your claims, it appears that you promptly got a response from an Apple employee, and it appears that you didn’t follow his instructions to file a radar in bugreporter.apple.com.<br></p><p>Now that Xcode 8 has shipped to the Mac App Store today, I’d suggest you download that and try it.  There are a number of bugs that are fixed between beta 6 and the final release, and that may include this one.<br></p><p>&gt; I was doing something &quot;simple&quot; in Playgrounds and my version of Playgrounds doesn&#39;t function properly because it is emitting an error when I write bug-free code.  Why is Playgrounds so flaky?  Sometimes, it shows the output on the right side; sometime, it doesn’t.<br></p><p>Two simple and obvious answers come to mind: you are running advertised-as-beta software, and even shipping software does have bugs.<br></p><p>&gt; I have had mixed success with the bug reporter tool from Apple; most of the time, they ask for the system diagnostics and then, tell you to update your version.  Sometimes, they just close the issue and nothing happens.<br></p><p><br>I understand that you claim to have had problems with Radar/bugreporter.apple.com, but again I can see no evidence of you ever filing a bug in it (and you haven’t provided me any radar numbers to cross reference), so there isn’t much I can do to help you.  Needless to say, we do actually need the system diagnostics in order to reproduce issues like this, as you found on the forum, your issue doesn’t reproduce trivially for other folks.<br></p><p><br>Finally, as others have pointed out, your approach on this thread hasn’t been particularly constructive.  Despite your apparent expectation, Apple has not signed up to fix any and every bug reported against Swift.  That said, we all want to build a strong community, and if you are interested in working in a helpful and productive way we would love for you to be part of that community.

I’m a technology owner and help support developers using it, and I find that many times people report bugs or ask for help without having done all they could to analyze the problem. Sometimes this is a dead end, but often you can uncover more information that can greatly help the engineers fix the bug, and sometimes you can find workarounds that get you unblocked.<br></p><p>Some advice based on stuff I see in my project’s forums:<br></p><p>— Read error messages carefully. Sometimes people report that “it won’t compile” or “it crashed” and append a dump of the log, without noticing that the log includes a message that pretty clearly identifies what they did wrong.<br>— Look for clues in crash logs / backtraces. Even if you don’t know how the software is implemented or have the source code, just looking at the function names in a backtrace or crash can give you clues about what it’s doing, which might help you find workarounds.<br>— Try to boil a problem down to a simpler case. Ideally something you can do in a playground.<br>— Learn common crash/error patterns. I can’t think of any Swift-specific ones at the moment, but a super common Objective-C one is the crash in `objc_msgsend`, which an experienced developer knows the program must have messaged either a deallocated object, or a bogus object reference.<br>— Treat debugging as a science. Act like a scientist. Examine the evidence, form hypotheses, invent experiments to test the hypotheses. “If this variable is being clobbered, maybe it’s because this method is called re-entrantly? I can add a flag to it to test for a re-entrant call…”<br></p><p>—Jens<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20160914/5a6a5537/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c84f5c3ebbefdb2b158e4b4f26c4aa1?s=50"></div><header><strong>Swift and Xcode along with Playgrounds is full of bugs</strong> from <string>Shyamal Chandra</string> &lt;shyamalc at gmail.com&gt;<p>November  1, 2016 at 11:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Hi Chris,<br></p><p>First of all, there is tremendous instability with Xcode Playgrounds.

I think you have me confused; I am not yelling.  I didn&#39;t flame Tim Cook<br>or Chris Latter.<br>2. Github would be a great place to use for the extensible documentation.<br>3. Volunteers are great because they might get jobs from Apple or become<br>great evangelists for knowing industry-quality code<br>4. They could sell Venmo or PayPal support and build an ecosystem of<br>support at lower prices that are super fast with nanopayments (e.g.<br>Muhammad Yunus).<br>5. Everyone should be on first name basis with Tim because he is going to<br>help us in some way with his hands-on and administrative decisions both in<br>policy and implementation.  Wait, I sent a letter once to Satya Nadella and<br>he sent me a better grade headset.  Customer engagement should be personal,<br>not hierarchical.<br>6. From my limited MSM perspective and Walter Isaacson&#39;s book on Steve<br>Jobs, I cannot comment on the &quot;nail my head to the floor&quot;.  This type of<br>anecdotal way of circumventing the issue might be best addressed with a<br>phone number.  I included my phone number. :-)<br>7. My CPU is not being used 100%; even then, why is the app still loading<br>and not doing on-the-fly compilation (I am unsure what it is doing without<br>debug mode.)?
