This result is counterintuitive.<br>   I’d like to present my motivation, which I think is pretty compelling.  In several codebases, I have<br>&gt; final private class Foo { //this class is an implementation detail of Bar and is declared ‘private&#39;<br>&gt;    private var _children : [Next] = [] //access only from special queue, as required by $EXTERNAL_REQUIREMENT<br>&gt;    let queue: dispatch_queue_t = dispatch_queue_create(“specialQueue&quot;, DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL)<br>&gt;       func appendChild(n: Next) {<br>&gt;            dispatch_sync(queue) { _children.append(n) }<br>&gt;       }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; final class Bar {<br>&gt;    let f = Foo()<br>&gt;    init() {<br>&gt; 	f.appendChild(…)<br>&gt;        f._children[0].baz() //whoops: race condition<br>&gt;    }<br>&gt; }<br>   In words, the problem here is that:<br>   1.  Foo is an implementation detail of Bar, and so Foo should be private<br></p><p>- Ignored:<br>   2.  Foo has its own implementation detail, _children<br>   3.  Because Foo is already private, _children cannot be “more” private<br>   4.  Thus _children must be visible at the file level<br>   5.  Since it is visible at the file level, it may be used<br>   6.  If it is used, it will most likely cause a race condition<br>   7.  Race conditions are very hard to debug and I need all the help I can get not to write them in the first place<br></p><p>   The solutions I see for this problem are as follows:<br></p><p>   1.  This thread’s proposal (e.g., to invent a new access modifier, restricting _children to visibility below the file level)<br>   2.  Vend a framework / module just for these two classes.  I present this as silly for many realistic sizes of Foo and Bar.<br>   3.  Promote Foo to internal visibility, when it is really a private implementation detail<br>   4.  What I actually do in this codelisting, which is to use underscores as a naming convention, and pray nobody on the team screws it up, because the compiler is no help.<br></p><p>   I would like to hear from the folks who don’t see the need of another access modifier, what solution to this problem they plan to maintain in their own projects.  Because this design pattern (queue-controlled ivar) is not uncommon, and the lack of a fourth access control keyword has produced real race conditions that I have spent real time debugging, that is completely avoidable via a keyword like classified/local/secret.<br></p><p>   Drew<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>access control proposal</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>December 12, 2015 at 05:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt;   I would like to hear from the folks who don’t see the need of another access modifier, what solution to this problem they plan to maintain in their own projects.

In your case, three access modifiers isn’t enough to prevent this mistake; you need four. But, given four, you could provide an example that needs five. Given five, you could come up with one for six. Given N access modifiers, you can write a case where you need N + 1.<br></p><p>There will never be enough. At some point, you just have to draw the line and say “this is enough; beyond here, you’re just going to have to take responsibility for your code.” Swift draws the line at a single file, a cohesive unit of code that’s all visible at once (at least with scrolling), but which still can contain things with no direct relationship. Small enough that you ought to be able to keep the outline of it in your head, but large enough that there’s still plenty of flexibility.<br></p><p>This is absolutely a judgement call that reasonable people can disagree on. But personally, my judgement is that `private` is private enough.<br></p><p>ADDENDUM:<br></p><p>Actually, for this case, there *is* a way to achieve better safety without additional access modifiers. Create a new file and call it Synchronized.swift:<br></p><p>	// This could be a struct, but that leads to some odd copying semantics.<br>	final class Synchronized&lt;Value&gt; {<br>		private var value: Value<br>		private let queue = dispatch_queue_create(“specialQueue&quot;, DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL)<br>		<br>		init(value: Value) {<br>			self.value = value<br>		}<br>		<br>		mutating func withValue&lt;R&gt;(closure: (inout value: T) -&gt; R) -&gt; R {<br>			var returnValue: R?<br>			dispatch_sync(queue) {<br>				returnValue = closure(value)<br>			}<br>			return returnValue!<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>Now in your original file, you write:<br></p><p>	final private class Foo { //this class is an implementation detail of Bar and is declared ‘private&#39;<br>	  private var _children = Synchronized(value: [] as [Next]) //access only from special queue, as required by $EXTERNAL_REQUIREMENT<br>	     func appendChild(n: Next) {<br>	          _children.withValue { (inout children: [Next]) in<br>			children.append(n)<br>		}<br>	     }<br>	}<br>	<br>	final class Bar {<br>	  let f = Foo()<br>	  init() {<br>	      f.appendChild(…)<br>	      f._children[0].baz() // error—_children can’t do this directly, you need to call .withValue()<br>	      f._children.value[0].baz() // error—value is private and inaccessible from here<br>	  }<br>	}<br></p><p>Synchronized can, of course, be modified to support all sorts of other cases: shared queues, parallel read-only access, etc. The general concept of using *another* file’s `private` modifier to protect *this* file’s data can be used in many cases, and I think it’s a pretty good solution to problems like these.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a838c63b9093a77fb88231d65effa3b3?s=50"></div><header><strong>access control proposal</strong> from <string>Drew Crawford</string> &lt;drew at sealedabstract.com&gt;<p>December 12, 2015 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; I mean, look, you’re right.

The C developer says they do not need half of Swift because their solution is to be more careful writing code.  The C developer is naive.<br></p><p>But in *this* language, we adopt zero and low-cost abstractions in the name of safety.  A scoped access modifier is a zero-cost abstraction that makes the language safer.  We should adopt it.  If for no other reason, than consistency with the other aspects of the language design.

People who don’t like this feature don’t misunderstand it; they just have a different subjective assessment of its value.<br></p><p>&gt; My justification is essentially that A) something like Synchronized is a problem nearly everybody has and B) the difficulty of defining a class-based solution in an optimal way.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; On B, we seem to agree:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  it might be difficult to construct a Synchronized instance correctly.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; So I can only conclude you disagree about A.  However, I think my A is much stronger than is strictly necessary to demand a language feature.  There are plenty of language features that not everyone uses, so the fact that you don&#39;t have a need for it (or even &quot;many people&quot;) is not really a counterargument I am able to understand.<br></p><p>As far as a standard Synchronized is concerned, I agree with you that it’s a good idea. I am simply *worried* that we may have trouble coming up with a design that’s flexible enough to accommodate multiple synchronization methods, but still makes it easy to create a properly-configured Synchronized object. For example, something like this would be so complicated to configure that it would virtually defeat the purpose of having a Synchronized type:<br></p><p>	class Synchronized&lt;Value&gt; {<br>		init(value: Value, mutableRunner: (Void -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void, immutableRunner: (Void -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void) { … }<br>		…<br>	}<br></p><p>So I’m going to think out loud about this for a minute.

That’s…actually pretty clean. And I suppose if you want it to default to using a dispatch queue, that’s just a default value on Synchronized.init(value:on:), or a new init(value:) added in an extension in LibDispatch. I thought this would be a lot hairier.<br></p><p>So, yeah, I guess I like the idea of a standard Synchronized. A well-designed version (one with something like SynchronizerType) can work with multiple locking mechanisms, without resorting to something error-prone like passing in closures. +1 for that.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2861bfeb71de9de58206bb6ae750bc2f?s=50"></div><header><strong>access control proposal</strong> from <string>ilya</string> &lt;ilya.nikokoshev at gmail.com&gt;<p>December 14, 2015 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; I believe that *most*—certainly not all, but most—uses of `local` are<br>like this. `local` would improve the code&#39;s safety, but some sort of<br>refactoring would be even better.

That’s…actually pretty clean. And I suppose if you want it to default<br>&gt; to using a dispatch queue, that’s just a default value on<br>&gt; Synchronized.init(value:on:), or a new init(value:) added in an extension<br>&gt; in LibDispatch. I thought this would be a lot hairier.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So, yeah, I guess I like the idea of a standard Synchronized. A<br>&gt; well-designed version (one with something like SynchronizerType) can work<br>&gt; with multiple locking mechanisms, without resorting to something<br>&gt; error-prone like passing in closures. +1 for that.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; --<br>&gt; Brent Royal-Gordon<br>&gt; Architechies<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151214/6de5175a/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72cc28f12d423d7d87c5e20e8de0966c?s=50"></div><header><strong>access control proposal</strong> from <string>Ilya Belenkiy</string> &lt;ilya.belenkiy at gmail.com&gt;<p>December 14, 2015 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>If you were writing a book, would you want to put every paragraph into a<br>separate file?<br></p><p>On Mon, Dec 14, 2015 at 2:49 AM ilya via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; &gt; I believe that *most*—certainly not all, but most—uses of `local` are<br>&gt; like this. `local` would improve the code&#39;s safety, but some sort of<br>&gt; refactoring would be even better.

It’s another thing to learn, another thing to<br>&gt;&gt; think about, another way you have to mentally analyze your code.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; I meant zero performance cost.  Of course all features have &quot;cost&quot; if<br>&gt;&gt; we mean &quot;cognitive overhead&quot;.  Type safety for example has a huge cognitive<br>&gt;&gt; overhead.  Think back to the days of &quot;Bool is not an NSString&quot;.  But the<br>&gt;&gt; benefit of typesafety is large.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; In this case, the cognitive overhead is small, and so is the benefit.<br>&gt;&gt; But I think the value-per-unit-cost is similar.  In both cases the compiler<br>&gt;&gt; helps you not do something very very bad, that is hard to debug in ObjC.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; And I’m saying that I think the benefit is even smaller than you think it<br>&gt;&gt; is, because you can usually get the same benefits by other means, and the<br>&gt;&gt; resulting code will be *even safer* than `local` would give you. Again,<br>&gt;&gt; consider the “value protected by a queue” case. Using `local` here limits<br>&gt;&gt; the amount of code which could contain an access-without-synchronization<br>&gt;&gt; bug, but `Synchronized` *completely eliminates* that class of bugs.<br>&gt;&gt; Synchronized is a *better*, *safer* solution than `local`.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I believe that *most*—certainly not all, but most—uses of `local` are<br>&gt;&gt; like this. `local` would improve the code&#39;s safety, but some sort of<br>&gt;&gt; refactoring would be even better. Because of that, I don’t think `local` is<br>&gt;&gt; as valuable as you think it is.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; many people, when they do that, find this idea wanting.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; Who?  You?  Then build an argument around that.  I don&#39;t know who &quot;many<br>&gt;&gt; people&quot; are or what their justification is.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I’m sorry, I don’t mean to make it sound like I’m speaking for some big,<br>&gt;&gt; ill-defined posse. I just mean that different people will draw the line on<br>&gt;&gt; the necessary cost-to-benefit in different places, and for some, this<br>&gt;&gt; feature will fall on the wrong side of the line. People who don’t like this<br>&gt;&gt; feature don’t misunderstand it; they just have a different subjective<br>&gt;&gt; assessment of its value.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; My justification is essentially that A) something like Synchronized is<br>&gt;&gt; a problem nearly everybody has and B) the difficulty of defining a<br>&gt;&gt; class-based solution in an optimal way.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; On B, we seem to agree:<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  it might be difficult to construct a Synchronized instance correctly.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; So I can only conclude you disagree about A.  However, I think my A is<br>&gt;&gt; much stronger than is strictly necessary to demand a language feature.<br>&gt;&gt; There are plenty of language features that not everyone uses, so the fact<br>&gt;&gt; that you don&#39;t have a need for it (or even &quot;many people&quot;) is not really a<br>&gt;&gt; counterargument I am able to understand.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; As far as a standard Synchronized is concerned, I agree with you that<br>&gt;&gt; it’s a good idea. I am simply *worried* that we may have trouble coming up<br>&gt;&gt; with a design that’s flexible enough to accommodate multiple<br>&gt;&gt; synchronization methods, but still makes it easy to create a<br>&gt;&gt; properly-configured Synchronized object. For example, something like this<br>&gt;&gt; would be so complicated to configure that it would virtually defeat the<br>&gt;&gt; purpose of having a Synchronized type:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;         class Synchronized&lt;Value&gt; {<br>&gt;&gt;                 init(value: Value, mutableRunner: (Void -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void,<br>&gt;&gt; immutableRunner: (Void -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void) { … }<br>&gt;&gt;                 …<br>&gt;&gt;         }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; So I’m going to think out loud about this for a minute. All code was<br>&gt;&gt; written in Mail.app and is untested.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I suppose we start with a protocol. The ideal interface for Synchronized<br>&gt;&gt; would look something like this:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;         protocol SynchronizedType: class {<br>&gt;&gt;                 typealias Value<br>&gt;&gt;                 func withMutableValue&lt;R&gt;(mutator: (inout Value) throws -&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; R) rethrows -&gt; R<br>&gt;&gt;                 func withValue&lt;R&gt;(accessor: Value throws -&gt; R) rethrows<br>&gt;&gt; -&gt; R<br>&gt;&gt;         }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; You could obviously write separate types like:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;         class QueueSynchronized&lt;Value&gt;: SynchronizedType {<br>&gt;&gt;                 private var value: Value<br>&gt;&gt;                 private let queue: dispatch_queue_t<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;                 init(value: Value, queue: dispatch_queue_t =<br>&gt;&gt; dispatch_queue_create(“QueueSynchronized”, DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT)) {<br>&gt;&gt;                         self.value = value<br>&gt;&gt;                         self.queue = queue<br>&gt;&gt;                 }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;                 func withMutableValue&lt;R&gt;(@noescape mutator: (inout Value)<br>&gt;&gt; throws -&gt; R) rethrows -&gt; R {<br>&gt;&gt;                         var ret: R?<br>&gt;&gt;                         var blockError: NSError?<br>&gt;&gt;                         dispatch_barrier_sync(queue) {<br>&gt;&gt;                                 do {<br>&gt;&gt;                                         ret = try mutator(&amp;value)<br>&gt;&gt;                                 }<br>&gt;&gt;                                 catch {<br>&gt;&gt;                                         blockError = error<br>&gt;&gt;                                 }<br>&gt;&gt;                         }<br>&gt;&gt;                         if let error = blockError {<br>&gt;&gt;                                 throw error<br>&gt;&gt;                         }<br>&gt;&gt;                         return ret!<br>&gt;&gt;                 }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;                 func withValue&lt;R&gt;(@noescape accessor: Value throws -&gt; R)<br>&gt;&gt; rethrows -&gt; R {<br>&gt;&gt;                         var ret: R?<br>&gt;&gt;                         var blockError: NSError?<br>&gt;&gt;                         dispatch_sync(queue) {<br>&gt;&gt;                                 do {<br>&gt;&gt;                                         ret = try accessor(value)<br>&gt;&gt;                                 }<br>&gt;&gt;                                 catch {<br>&gt;&gt;                                         blockError = error<br>&gt;&gt;                                 }<br>&gt;&gt;                         }<br>&gt;&gt;                         if let error = blockError {<br>&gt;&gt;                                 throw error<br>&gt;&gt;                         }<br>&gt;&gt;                         return ret!<br>&gt;&gt;                 }<br>&gt;&gt;         }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; and:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;         class NSLockSynchronized&lt;Value&gt;: SynchronizedType {<br>&gt;&gt;                 private var value: Value<br>&gt;&gt;                 private var lock: NSLock<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;                 init(value: Value, lock: NSLock = NSLock()) {<br>&gt;&gt;                         self.value = value<br>&gt;&gt;                         self.lock = lock<br>&gt;&gt;                 }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;                 func withMutableValue&lt;R&gt;(@noescape mutator: (inout Value)<br>&gt;&gt; throws -&gt; R) rethrows -&gt; R {<br>&gt;&gt;                         lock.lock()<br>&gt;&gt;                         defer { lock.unlock() }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;                         return try mutator(&amp;value)<br>&gt;&gt;                 }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;                 func withValue&lt;R&gt;(@noescape accessor: Value throws -&gt; R)<br>&gt;&gt; rethrows -&gt; R {<br>&gt;&gt;                         // XXX I don’t know how to get concurrent reads<br>&gt;&gt; with Cocoa locks.<br>&gt;&gt;                         lock.lock()<br>&gt;&gt;                         defer { lock.unlock() }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;                         return try accessor(value)<br>&gt;&gt;                 }<br>&gt;&gt;         }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; But that’s not a very satisfying design—so much boilerplate.

That’s…actually pretty clean. And I suppose if you want it to<br>&gt;&gt; default to using a dispatch queue, that’s just a default value on<br>&gt;&gt; Synchronized.init(value:on:), or a new init(value:) added in an extension<br>&gt;&gt; in LibDispatch. I thought this would be a lot hairier.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; So, yeah, I guess I like the idea of a standard Synchronized. A<br>&gt;&gt; well-designed version (one with something like SynchronizerType) can work<br>&gt;&gt; with multiple locking mechanisms, without resorting to something<br>&gt;&gt; error-prone like passing in closures. +1 for that.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; --<br>&gt;&gt; Brent Royal-Gordon<br>&gt;&gt; Architechies<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151214/93473192/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72cc28f12d423d7d87c5e20e8de0966c?s=50"></div><header><strong>access control proposal</strong> from <string>Ilya Belenkiy</string> &lt;ilya.belenkiy at gmail.com&gt;<p>December 14, 2015 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&quot;I’m sorry, I don’t mean to make it sound like I’m speaking for some big,<br>ill-defined posse.

It’s another thing to learn, another thing to<br>&gt; think about, another way you have to mentally analyze your code.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I meant zero performance cost.  Of course all features have &quot;cost&quot; if we<br>&gt; mean &quot;cognitive overhead&quot;.  Type safety for example has a huge cognitive<br>&gt; overhead.  Think back to the days of &quot;Bool is not an NSString&quot;.  But the<br>&gt; benefit of typesafety is large.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; In this case, the cognitive overhead is small, and so is the benefit.<br>&gt; But I think the value-per-unit-cost is similar.  In both cases the compiler<br>&gt; helps you not do something very very bad, that is hard to debug in ObjC.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And I’m saying that I think the benefit is even smaller than you think it<br>&gt; is, because you can usually get the same benefits by other means, and the<br>&gt; resulting code will be *even safer* than `local` would give you. Again,<br>&gt; consider the “value protected by a queue” case. Using `local` here limits<br>&gt; the amount of code which could contain an access-without-synchronization<br>&gt; bug, but `Synchronized` *completely eliminates* that class of bugs.<br>&gt; Synchronized is a *better*, *safer* solution than `local`.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I believe that *most*—certainly not all, but most—uses of `local` are like<br>&gt; this. `local` would improve the code&#39;s safety, but some sort of refactoring<br>&gt; would be even better. Because of that, I don’t think `local` is as valuable<br>&gt; as you think it is.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; many people, when they do that, find this idea wanting.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Who?  You?  Then build an argument around that.  I don&#39;t know who &quot;many<br>&gt; people&quot; are or what their justification is.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I’m sorry, I don’t mean to make it sound like I’m speaking for some big,<br>&gt; ill-defined posse. I just mean that different people will draw the line on<br>&gt; the necessary cost-to-benefit in different places, and for some, this<br>&gt; feature will fall on the wrong side of the line. People who don’t like this<br>&gt; feature don’t misunderstand it; they just have a different subjective<br>&gt; assessment of its value.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; My justification is essentially that A) something like Synchronized is a<br>&gt; problem nearly everybody has and B) the difficulty of defining a<br>&gt; class-based solution in an optimal way.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; On B, we seem to agree:<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;  it might be difficult to construct a Synchronized instance correctly.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; So I can only conclude you disagree about A.  However, I think my A is<br>&gt; much stronger than is strictly necessary to demand a language feature.<br>&gt; There are plenty of language features that not everyone uses, so the fact<br>&gt; that you don&#39;t have a need for it (or even &quot;many people&quot;) is not really a<br>&gt; counterargument I am able to understand.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As far as a standard Synchronized is concerned, I agree with you that it’s<br>&gt; a good idea. I am simply *worried* that we may have trouble coming up with<br>&gt; a design that’s flexible enough to accommodate multiple synchronization<br>&gt; methods, but still makes it easy to create a properly-configured<br>&gt; Synchronized object. For example, something like this would be so<br>&gt; complicated to configure that it would virtually defeat the purpose of<br>&gt; having a Synchronized type:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         class Synchronized&lt;Value&gt; {<br>&gt;                 init(value: Value, mutableRunner: (Void -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void,<br>&gt; immutableRunner: (Void -&gt; Void) -&gt; Void) { … }<br>&gt;                 …<br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So I’m going to think out loud about this for a minute. All code was<br>&gt; written in Mail.app and is untested.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I suppose we start with a protocol. The ideal interface for Synchronized<br>&gt; would look something like this:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         protocol SynchronizedType: class {<br>&gt;                 typealias Value<br>&gt;                 func withMutableValue&lt;R&gt;(mutator: (inout Value) throws -&gt;<br>&gt; R) rethrows -&gt; R<br>&gt;                 func withValue&lt;R&gt;(accessor: Value throws -&gt; R) rethrows -&gt;<br>&gt; R<br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You could obviously write separate types like:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         class QueueSynchronized&lt;Value&gt;: SynchronizedType {<br>&gt;                 private var value: Value<br>&gt;                 private let queue: dispatch_queue_t<br>&gt;<br>&gt;                 init(value: Value, queue: dispatch_queue_t =<br>&gt; dispatch_queue_create(“QueueSynchronized”, DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT)) {<br>&gt;                         self.value = value<br>&gt;                         self.queue = queue<br>&gt;                 }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;                 func withMutableValue&lt;R&gt;(@noescape mutator: (inout Value)<br>&gt; throws -&gt; R) rethrows -&gt; R {<br>&gt;                         var ret: R?<br>&gt;                         var blockError: NSError?<br>&gt;                         dispatch_barrier_sync(queue) {<br>&gt;                                 do {<br>&gt;                                         ret = try mutator(&amp;value)<br>&gt;                                 }<br>&gt;                                 catch {<br>&gt;                                         blockError = error<br>&gt;                                 }<br>&gt;                         }<br>&gt;                         if let error = blockError {<br>&gt;                                 throw error<br>&gt;                         }<br>&gt;                         return ret!<br>&gt;                 }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;                 func withValue&lt;R&gt;(@noescape accessor: Value throws -&gt; R)<br>&gt; rethrows -&gt; R {<br>&gt;                         var ret: R?<br>&gt;                         var blockError: NSError?<br>&gt;                         dispatch_sync(queue) {<br>&gt;                                 do {<br>&gt;                                         ret = try accessor(value)<br>&gt;                                 }<br>&gt;                                 catch {<br>&gt;                                         blockError = error<br>&gt;                                 }<br>&gt;                         }<br>&gt;                         if let error = blockError {<br>&gt;                                 throw error<br>&gt;                         }<br>&gt;                         return ret!<br>&gt;                 }<br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; and:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;         class NSLockSynchronized&lt;Value&gt;: SynchronizedType {<br>&gt;                 private var value: Value<br>&gt;                 private var lock: NSLock<br>&gt;<br>&gt;                 init(value: Value, lock: NSLock = NSLock()) {<br>&gt;                         self.value = value<br>&gt;                         self.lock = lock<br>&gt;                 }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;                 func withMutableValue&lt;R&gt;(@noescape mutator: (inout Value)<br>&gt; throws -&gt; R) rethrows -&gt; R {<br>&gt;                         lock.lock()<br>&gt;                         defer { lock.unlock() }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;                         return try mutator(&amp;value)<br>&gt;                 }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;                 func withValue&lt;R&gt;(@noescape accessor: Value throws -&gt; R)<br>&gt; rethrows -&gt; R {<br>&gt;                         // XXX I don’t know how to get concurrent reads<br>&gt; with Cocoa locks.<br>&gt;                         lock.lock()<br>&gt;                         defer { lock.unlock() }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;                         return try accessor(value)<br>&gt;                 }<br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; But that’s not a very satisfying design—so much boilerplate.

That’s…actually pretty clean. And I suppose if you want it to default<br>&gt; to using a dispatch queue, that’s just a default value on<br>&gt; Synchronized.init(value:on:), or a new init(value:) added in an extension<br>&gt; in LibDispatch. I thought this would be a lot hairier.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So, yeah, I guess I like the idea of a standard Synchronized. A<br>&gt; well-designed version (one with something like SynchronizerType) can work<br>&gt; with multiple locking mechanisms, without resorting to something<br>&gt; error-prone like passing in closures. +1 for that.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; --<br>&gt; Brent Royal-Gordon<br>&gt; Architechies<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151214/f4c7a062/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>access control proposal</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>December 14, 2015 at 06:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Do you really see no value in completely hiding implementation details of an API and making it enforceable by the compiler?<br></p><p>On the contrary, I see great value in hiding implementation details.

By adding a ‘scope’ access modifier we are able to<br>&gt; properly hide these implementation details regardless of physical layout.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As mentioned above, what if you only want to make them available to *some* of<br>&gt; the extensions?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -David<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151214/97620137/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72cc28f12d423d7d87c5e20e8de0966c?s=50"></div><header><strong>access control proposal</strong> from <string>Ilya Belenkiy</string> &lt;ilya.belenkiy at gmail.com&gt;<p>December 14, 2015 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>All of these examples for more access control could and should be<br>refactored to have simple interfaces with completely hidden implementation<br>details.<br></p><p>The discussion has become unnecessarily complicated. This proposal is about<br>a fundamental concept of software engineering: provide a small and simple<br>interface that serves a particular purpose and hide implementation details.<br></p><p>Implementation details need to be hidden for several reasons:<br>- ensure that the invariant of the public API holds true regardless of how<br>the public API is used. For example, a stack&#39;s element count and relative<br>order changes only with push() and pop().<br>- the implementation could be changed without affecting how the API is<br>used. For example, a stack backed by an array could turn into a stack<br>backed by a linked list.<br>- the API that the user has to deal with is small. If the user can see the<br>internals, he has to constantly separate what&#39;s public (and allowed) and<br>what is private (and could change).<br></p><p>Currently, the only 2 ways to express this concept in Swift are<br>1) use private and put the implementation  into a separate file<br>2) use _ or some other convention to distinguish public APIs from the<br>functions that are used for implementation<br></p><p>Using separate files works, but it doesn&#39;t work well for related concepts.<br>It often makes sense to group similar concepts / interfaces / APIs in one<br>file. This solution comes at the expense of not being able to do this,<br>which I find extremely limiting. An analogy: it makes sense to put separate<br>chapters of a book into different files, but a file per paragraph is<br>extremely inconvenient.<br></p><p>Using _ also helps, but it&#39;s coding by convention. It is still possible and<br>easy to break it and break the code. And we see it all the time with ObjC<br>developers trying to use private APIs to fix a bug or add functionality<br>that is not public. It also forces the programmer to sort through all the _<br>in search for the APIs that he can use. And if he first sees a similar<br>private API, it takes a mental strain not to use it and keep searching for<br>the pubic version (if there is one).<br></p><p>Using local solves the problem an all accounts:<br>- the compiler enforces that the invariant holds true (as long as the<br>implementation is correct)<br>- the auto completion shows only the methods that are available instead of<br>showing the APIs that the user should not use<br>- the code can be organized in a way that makes sense with grouping of<br>related code into one file without introducing oversharing of APIs.<br></p><p>Local is also very much in line with Swift&#39;s focus on strong type system,<br>elimination of accidental mistakes, and code clarity. If we have guard that<br>can be easily replaced by an if statement, I don&#39;t see how local is a<br>problem. If you say &quot;but guard helps eliminate lots of nested if<br>statements&quot;, I can reply &quot;but local helps eliminate lots of tiny files&quot;.<br>Any arguments about cognitive overhead, making language bigger, etc. can be<br>argued the same way. The biggest difference though is that local is not<br>only about clarity and convenience, it&#39;s also about correctness. I would<br>even argue that local should be the default and that any other access level<br>modifier should be a deliberate choice by the programmer.<br></p><p>--<br>Ilya Belenkiy<br></p><p>On Sun, Dec 13, 2015 at 4:58 PM Brent Royal-Gordon via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; I mean, look, you’re right. In your case, three access modifiers isn’t<br>&gt; enough to prevent this mistake; you need four. But,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; given four, you could provide an example that needs five. Given five,<br>&gt; you could come up with one for six. Given N access modifiers, you can write<br>&gt; a case where you need N + 1.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Nope.  What we&#39;re talking about (what I&#39;m talking about, anyway) is a<br>&gt; syntactically scoped access modifier.  There is no N+1 case.  There is no<br>&gt; &quot;even more scoped&quot;.  There is no inductive case.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I mean, it is possible to write a troll proposal for an access modifier<br>&gt; visible to the 3 lines before and after the declaration, or something.<br>&gt; That much I grant.  But troll proposals aside, a scoped access modifier is<br>&gt; the quark of the access modifiers; there is no sensible way to go halvsies.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I actually immediately thought of several things you might want:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; • You have two logical “groups” of properties and methods in a type, and<br>&gt; you want to only permit access within a group. But both groups have stored<br>&gt; properties, so they must be defined in the scope of the main type<br>&gt; definition.<br>&gt; • You have types nested within your type. You want methods in your own<br>&gt; type to have access, but not methods in those nested types.<br>&gt; • Alternatively, you have types nested within your type. You want the<br>&gt; outer type to have access to things in the nested type, but not any other<br>&gt; type.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I don’t think these are troll proposals. They *are* a little more limited,<br>&gt; a little more esoteric, but you could say the same thing about `local` vs.<br>&gt; `private`. And in some cases you can emulate some of these with the four<br>&gt; access modifiers you want, but again, you could say the same thing about<br>&gt; `local` vs. `private`.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Actually, for this case, there *is* a way to achieve better safety<br>&gt; without additional access modifiers. Create a new file and call it<br>&gt; Synchronized.swift:<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; This is the solution that I ship.  I think if we don&#39;t add a new<br>&gt; visibility modifier, we should definitely do this in the standard library,<br>&gt; because &quot;resource synchronization&quot; is a problem most modern programs have.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This is not a bad idea. The only potential issue I can see with it is<br>&gt; that, if it’s made too general, it might be difficult to construct a<br>&gt; Synchronized instance correctly.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; My solution is to be careful when I’m writing code.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; It is actually *this* statement which is weak to an induction attack.<br>&gt; We can *always* be more careful writing code.  Why do we need typechecking,<br>&gt; why do we need integer overflow trapping, why do we need array out of<br>&gt; bounds exceptions?  The C developer says they do not need half of Swift<br>&gt; because their solution is to be more careful writing code.  The C developer<br>&gt; is naive.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; But in *this* language, we adopt zero and low-cost abstractions in the<br>&gt; name of safety.  A scoped access modifier is a zero-cost abstraction that<br>&gt; makes the language safer.  We should adopt it.  If for no other reason,<br>&gt; than consistency with the other aspects of the language design.  Either<br>&gt; that or we should move integer overflow checks into the standard library<br>&gt; for consistency with Synchronized, which I present as a troll proposal.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; But it’s not zero-cost. It’s another thing to learn, another thing to<br>&gt; think about, another way you have to mentally analyze your code. It has to<br>&gt; be balanced against the goal of keeping the language small and simple. And<br>&gt; many people, when they do that, find this idea wanting.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I mean, I don&#39;t know about you, but I get called in to look at projects<br>&gt; regularly that have a MainViewController.swift that weighs 10KLOC.  I<br>&gt; didn&#39;t write it.  I didn&#39;t make the mess.  I just want tools to help me<br>&gt; clean it up.  &#39;private&#39; is useless in that context, and it&#39;s a (sadly)<br>&gt; typical context in iOS.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; `local` is going to be equally useless in this context, because<br>&gt; MainViewController.swift will almost certainly contain one 9.999KLOC<br>&gt; `class` block. Cleaning up is, practically by definition, messy and tiring.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; --<br>&gt; Brent Royal-Gordon<br>&gt; Architechies<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151214/f205db12/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
