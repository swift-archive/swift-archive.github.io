This is another special, unprincipled, nonportable feature that relies on the Objective-C runtime. If we change  id to bridge to Any, it definitely no longer makes sense to apply to AnyObject. A couple of possibilities to consider:<br></p><p>We could transfer the existing AnyObject behavior verbatim to Any.<br>We could attempt to eliminate the behavior as a language feature. An approximation of AnyObject&#39;s magic behavior can be made using operators and unapplied method references, in a way that also works for Swift types:<br></p><p>  /// Dynamically dispatch a method on Any.<br>  func =&gt; &lt;T, V&gt;(myself: Any, method: (T) -&gt; V) -&gt; V? {<br>    if let myself = myself as? T {<br>      return method(myself)<br>    }<br>    return nil<br>  }<br>though that&#39;s not quite the right thing for id lookup, since you want a respondsToSelector rather than isKindOfClass check.<br></p><p>We could narrow the scope of the behavior. Jordan has suggested allowing only property and subscript lookup off of AnyObject or Any, as a way of allowing easy navigation of property lists, one of the most common sources of id in Foundation.<br>If we&#39;re confident that the SDK will be sufficiently Swiftified that ids become relatively rare, maybe we could get away without a replacement at all.<br>What was decided concerning that? I felt sure that the lookup had been completely removed, but I’m obviously mistaken.<br></p><p>David.<br></p><p><br>&gt; On 25 Aug 2016, at 09:59, Quinn The Eskimo! via swift-users &lt;swift-users at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; On 25 Aug 2016, at 08:23, David Hart via swift-users &lt;swift-users at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; You can’t call arbitrary functions on AnyObject anymore.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; You’re mixing up `Any` and `AnyObject`.
