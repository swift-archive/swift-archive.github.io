The proposal has been *accepted*, with a revision to change “MemoryLayout” into an enum with no cases.  The overall feedback was very positive.  The core team did discuss a proposal to move the generic type to each member, but felt that that would increase the verbosity of using the API (since T.self would be required) and would lead to possible confusion in the API (because it wouldn’t be clear whether you were asking for the size of a type, or the size of its metatype).<br></p><p>Thank you to Erica Sadun and Dave Abrahams for driving this discussion forward.<br></p><p>-Chris Lattner<br>Review Manager<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
