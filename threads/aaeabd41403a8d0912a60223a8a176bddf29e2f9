Statement scope would avoid problems like this.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; You are thinking about this the inverse way. That the first case<br>&gt;&gt; works is an artifact of the optimizer failing to do a good enough<br>&gt;&gt; job. Future improved ARC optimization can cause both to fail.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Were this the case I think it would be a step in the wrong direction. Swift is getting<br>&gt; very eager at deallocating objects hence all the &quot;withXYZ()&quot; methods of late which<br>&gt; seem like noise to me. Certainly, having something perform differently from debug<br>&gt; to release builds was not a feature! Viva la Statement Scope which solves all this.<br></p><p>Having had a background in C++, where that rule is de rigeur, and after<br>working on its core language definition including move semantics, I am<br>*really* happy we&#39;re not making the same mistake in Swift.<br></p><p>The lack of such a guarantee, which is very seldom actually useful<br>anyhow, is what allows us to turn costly copies (with associated<br>refcount traffic and, often CoW allocation and copying fallout) into<br>moves, which are practically free.  Adopting it would basically kill our<br>performance story for CoW.<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
