You shouldn&#39;t be parsing source code<br>&gt;with ad-hoc tools.  You need to use a real compiler.<br></p><p>One may want to use a real compiler, but one doesn&#39;t need an entire compiler to parse otherwise ignored source code just looking for comments.<br></p><p>&gt;Just because it<br>&gt;happened to work with, say C, does not mean that you got it right.  I<br>&gt;doubt that a program that you described was correctly handling, say,<br>&gt;line continuations in comments.<br></p><p>You would be incorrect in my case (I handle even the weirdest situations like backslash line continuation in the middle of a delimiter), but point taken for simple-minded tools.  The fact that C or other source code can have some weird legal constructions (and I&#39;m assuming Swift has fewer such possible weird constructions) doesn&#39;t mean the user is required to employ those very rare constructions.<br></p><p>The point is to make the job easier, at almost no cost, for simple tools.  And if the compiler doesn&#39;t recognize text comments as distinguishable from code comments, then relying on a complete compiler to do the source parsing isn&#39;t going to help any, especially since it presumably just tosses the text in the comment.<br></p><p>&gt;The bottom line is, you need to use a real compiler frontend to parse<br>&gt;source code.<br></p><p>It&#39;s not about parsing the meat of the source code.  It&#39;s about robustly and easily recognizing a delimiter that signals the basic purpose of an otherwise-ignored comment.  It&#39;s about wanting unambiguously to know which part of a source file is text comment for humans and which part is excised code being kept around for later uses.  The alternative is doing some kind of non-robust statistical test on the text to make the call as to what its purpose is (which is also language-specific).<br></p><p>All I&#39;m advocating is that with a tiny little bit of *standardized* help that harms no one and is upwardly compatible, the world could be a better place for everyone, not just me with my private /*{ ... }*/ solution.<br></p><p><br>Doug McKenna<br>Mathemaesthetics, Inc.<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
