So at the monment there is a need to use 3rd party tools (VM, Docker) to run a linux kernel on Os x to build Swift Liunx server app&#39;s.

It could be inbeded as a XPC proecess so that Linux VM would be used for all project&#39;s.<br> The target should be able to be configured by user to pick if it runs on OS X or Linux. <br></p><p>This could Also be tied into the Package Manager where there could be a option to set the packages target runtime.<br></p><p>Also to start with I don&#39;t think this would need to be under full user control, What I mean by that I would not let the user pick the Linux OS or packages that are installed etc. I think the Linux os should include a common set of software eg: CURL, OpenSSL , etc. just the common set of software.<br></p><p>or if people think otherwise that it could have full user control of Linux OS and installed Software.<br></p><p>But My thought is to keep it simple and small so its as fast as possiable and at the end of the Day user should always Test on the Production OS which can be done using the current method&#39;s of running Linux on a VM or Cloud provider or Container.<br></p><p>I think that this would make the developer experance even better and add a valuable feature to Swift Package Manager.<br>Now Where I made the mistake in the other post to bring up XCode how this could then enable Builld/Run/Debug of a Linux target.

The approach described, using some kind of virtualization to be able to actually execute the build on Linux. This would have the advantage that the tests and executables could also be run. However, this would also be rather complicated and I&#39;m not sure it is ultimately the right place to solve this problem.<br></p><p>2. We could support cross-compiling to Linux. This would fit clearly in our feature set, and would also be a lot easier to make robust and with a good user experience.
