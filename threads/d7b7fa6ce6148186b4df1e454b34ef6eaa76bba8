So I’m really looking forward to the outcome of this discussion.<br></p><p>I’m also a passive observer in the world of Rust, and one thing that recently really impressed was their async I/O library “Tokio”. It is a fairly low level implementation of async I/O and futures in order to be able to build all kinds of networking implementations on top of it:<br></p><p>&quot;Tokio is an async I/O stack in Rust running the full gamut in terms of what it provides. At the very bottom you&#39;ll find the tokio-core crate with a bare-bones event loop and Future spawning. Near the top you&#39;ll find the tokio-proto crate with generic implementations of protocol details like pipelining and multiplexing used to serve requests to the Service trait intokio-service inspired by Finagle.”<br></p><p>https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio<br></p><p>What I find particularly interesting here is the architecture of Tokio and the broad applications this low level library offers for high level frameworks. Also, the performance seems to be extraordinary good.<br></p><p>I wanted mainly to raise awareness for this implementation to see if there’s something interest we could learn from it. I remember that Rust did a lot of experimentation in the async I/O area until they implemented Tokio.<br></p><p>Cheers,<br>Benedikt<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
