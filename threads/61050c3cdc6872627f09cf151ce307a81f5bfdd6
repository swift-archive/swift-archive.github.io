The proposal has been accepted. We plan to introduce the new syntax in both 2.2 and 3.0, using Doug&#39;s implementation at https://github.com/DougGregor/swift/tree/se-0021-generalized-naming. Support for the proposal was overwhelmingly positive. A number of contributors proposed an alternative syntax, using a placeholder in the argument value position:<br></p><p>let x = Foo.bar(_, bas: _)<br></p><p>with the idea that this could potentially generalize to partial application syntax. We don&#39;t think this is a good direction for Swift for a couple of reasons. Swift already has fairly compact syntax for forming closures over partially applied functions, { Foo.bar($0, bas: $1) }. It may not be everyone&#39;s aesthetic cup of tea, but this notation has several important advantages. The braces unambiguously delineate the boundaries of the closure, which is a subtle problem with Scala-like approaches. The braces also provide a visual cue that capture is occurring. The $n placeholders are also more general since they allow for reordering of arguments. &#39;_&#39; in particular is also a poor choice of placeholder, since in other contexts where it&#39;s used, it&#39;s meant as a &quot;black hole&quot; for value binding in patterns rather than as a placeholder for a meaningful bound value.<br></p><p>Another concern that was repeatedly raised was how to disambiguate overloads. We feel that contextual type disambiguation is sufficient for the use cases we envision. Cocoa&#39;s naming conventions already limit the amount of overloading that occurs in frameworks (though the Swift 3 renaming introduces more), and unapplied functions are generally used in contexts with adequate type context, such as parameters to higher-order functions. Introducing purpose-built syntax, such as interleaving types into the name like &quot;Foo.(_: Int bar: String)&quot;, would increase the complexity and ambiguity of the feature for relatively little gain.<br></p><p>-Joe<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/attachments/20160120/2157093a/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc3a9ea0c6c870343d9acb4ac3059cdc?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] Naming Functions with Argument Labels</strong> from <string>Matthew Johnson</string> &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt;<p>January 13, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>I like it quite a bit.  <br></p><p>It uses very readable syntax and covers most cases (I’m glad to see the backticks are gone).

I think this solves a real problem, and I like<br>that it&#39;s re-using the same syntax that we already use to talk about<br>functions in documentation and discussions. I&#39;m mildly concerned about<br>the visual ambiguity, and about the fact that if the parser encounters<br>`foo.bar(baz: qux` it doesn&#39;t know yet if &quot;qux&quot; is supposed to be an<br>expression (because it&#39;s a function call) or just a bare identifier<br>(because it&#39;s a function reference), and it can&#39;t know that until it<br>sees a colon. I&#39;m also mildly concerned that this feature will make it<br>impossible to ever introduce a single colon as a valid character in an<br>expression that&#39;s not surrounded by delimiters (e.g. dictionary literals<br>are fine because of the delimiters), but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s<br>something we&#39;d ever want to do (note that introducing a double colon,<br>e.g. ::, is fine because that&#39;s not legal in a function reference).<br></p><p>Given that I think the ambiguity can be dealt with, and I don&#39;t think<br>the visual ambiguity is particularly bad, and I&#39;d like to see this<br>problem have a solution, that&#39;s why I&#39;m tentatively in favor of it.<br></p><p>&gt; * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a<br>&gt;   change to Swift?<br></p><p>I think so, yes.<br></p><p>&gt; * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes.<br></p><p>&gt; * If you have you used other languages or libraries with a similar<br>&gt;   feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>I have not.

A placeholder-based currying syntax is a strict superset of this proposal&#39;s capabilities, so there&#39;s no reason to end up supporting three syntaxes; we can introduce the most sorely needed subset first and then make it more powerful later.<br></p><p>If there is absolutely no chance that placeholder-based currying will be added, even in Swift 4 or later, then I am in favor of this proposal.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>On the whole, yes.
