Apologies if I missed anything. I&#39;m assuming KVO/KVC is still incompatible with pure Swift, but I was looking for evidence that maybe something had been added in NSObject.<br></p><p>We work in a lot of real time/signal-ly code so we&#39;ve gotten a lot of good use out of KVO/KVC in Cocoa. I&#39;ve seen a lot of value in using it when doing UI work as well, either through bindings on OS X (which seems a little unloved these days), or directly by observing key values on iOS. The willSet/didSet?functions?in Swift is a great step forward for variables in having some of this behavior, but it&#39;s still messy in situations where you are dealing with classes you don&#39;t control. For example, we&#39;re an API vendor, and KVC/KVO is?handy for providing a way for a customer to observe changes. But for a pure Swift API we&#39;d have to provide and maintain some sort of larger callback structure, or have a workflow that encourages subclassing with customers adding their own getter/setter handlers.<br></p><p>Are there any plans to add anything like KVO or KVC to pure Swift, with maybe something the bridges to Obj-C KVO? Swift doesn&#39;t need to go down the road of full Obj-C style dynamism with method swizzling and all that. But some sort of key based inspection of objects, and language construct for getting callbacks on a property change would be great.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151203/3d5a2a23/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>KVO/KVC in Swift</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>December  3, 2015 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Dec 3, 2015, at 12:49 PM, Colin Cornaby &lt;colin.cornaby at mac.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; I looked through the Swift Foundation this morning to see if there was evidence of KVO/KVC, but I didn&#39;t find any.
