But that&#39;s probably just my personal opinion and a bit off topic.<br></p><p>Nevertheless .zero on CGRect is a Swift extension which is `static var`. There is currently no way to have static vars on classes in ObjC, which is where .black() comes from, so it&#39;s currently a class method.<br></p><p>On the other hand, you are correct that it&#39;s a bit inconsistent, since when you have `static var sharedInstance` on a Swift class, it gets indeed exported into ObjC as +(Instance *)sharedInstance; - so making it the other way around would make sense.<br></p><p>Theoretically, it could be possible to allow annotations, such as NS_SWIFT_NAME(black) to make it a static var:<br></p><p>+(instancetype)blackColor NS_SWIFT_NAME(black);<br></p><p><br></p><p>&gt; On Jun 3, 2016, at 4:48 PM, Bas Broek via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hi all,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I was wondering the other day why &quot;static initializers&quot;, as I will call them, are not unified:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; CGRect.zero<br>&gt; vs<br>&gt;&gt; UIColor.blackColor() - which will be UIColor.black() in Swift 3.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ... which both do pretty much the same; they are used as convenience initialization for the specific type.
