However the openness of future changes is definitely advantageous (including beta releases) since it allows a first draft to be written and then hopefully not too much changes between then and the final release. <br></p><p>The same problem also exists in StackOverflow answers where users have accepted a question that no longer works. It&#39;s almost impossible to go through the list of UIKit questions where an &quot;as UIxxx&quot; needs to be changed to an &quot;as! UIxxx&quot; but it might be more practical to work through those that have ++ or -- in them - provided that you can search questions for symbols which I&#39;m not sure you always can. <br></p><p>The point is that language agility is good in the initial few releases but each subsequent change has the potential to cause more of the tutorial/how to/blog posts to atrophy, and this should generally be a concern taken into account when changing or removing any feature.<br></p><p>Alex<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>Roll-out of deprecating ++ and --</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>December  5, 2015 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Dec 5, 2015, at 1:26 AM, Matthijs Hollemans &lt;mail at hollance.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The proposal for the removal of the ++ and -- operators states that,<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; In terms of roll-out, we should deprecate them in the Spring Swift 2.x release (with a nice Fixit hint to cover common cases), and remove them completely in Swift 3.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Is it possible to keep the Spring 2.x release non-breaking and backwards compatible?
