When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br></p><p>	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br></p><p>	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br></p><p>Thank you,<br></p><p>-Chris Lattner<br>Review Manager<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fe87aed0d64cdbc46378bf7596a7553?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0076: Add overrides taking an UnsafePointer source to non-destructive copying methods on UnsafeMutablePointer</strong> from <string>Andrew Trick</string> &lt;atrick at apple.com&gt;<p>May  3, 2016 at 09:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On May 3, 2016, at 8:56 PM, Chris Lattner &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The review of &quot;SE-0076: Add overrides taking an UnsafePointer source to non-destructive copying methods on UnsafeMutablePointer&quot; begins now and runs through May 9.

I don’t see a problem with it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Implicit argument conversion from UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;Pointee&gt; to UnsafePointer&lt;Pointee&gt; is normal and extremely obvious.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, Andy&#39;s approach seems cleaner than overloading.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; :-( …but it’s an implicit conversion. Which we’re trying to expunge from the language. (Sort of.)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I’ve heard exactly the opposite argument recently. Namely that explicit UnsafePointer construction indicates an “unsafe” cast (I personally don’t agree with that argument though).<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Tangential: Which of our current implicit conversions are considered bad? I can’t think of a good alternative, particularly for String/Array to UnsafePointer.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; String/Array to UnsafePointer can&#39;t be safely expressed in the language right now without the lifetime-extending wrapper closure, so I feel less bad about those. Inout-to-pointer conversions don&#39;t feel implicit because of the &#39;&amp;&#39;.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; For other conversions, the remaining implicit value-to-reference bridging conversion is up for review, and we&#39;ve talked about tightening up when implicit optional wrapping can occur. IUOs are out of the type system, which is probably as far as they&#39;ll go.

I completely agree that unsafe conversions need to grow a label.<br></p><p>Although I still somewhat prefer implicit Mutable to Immutable conversions not only because it is so convenient but because programmers will expect that behavior. It feels to me like we are mimicking a type qualifier. AFAIK it doesn’t introduce implementation complexity or strange corner cases.<br></p><p>-Andy<br></p><p>&gt; (The counter-movement is people who want implicit conversions from smaller to larger integer and floating-point types, so the tide may shift here.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Jordan<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160504/31bc43b0/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7abf2ce34651dd5e97cd97b16ce21bae?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0076: Add overrides taking an UnsafePointer source to non-destructive copying methods on UnsafeMutablePointer</strong> from <string>Guillaume Lessard</string> &lt;glessard at tffenterprises.com&gt;<p>May  4, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; * What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>It makes sense to have `assignFrom` and `initializeFrom` defined for `UnsafePointer` sources.<br></p><p>I would much rather see them defined simply with `UnsafePointer` rather than having overloads.
