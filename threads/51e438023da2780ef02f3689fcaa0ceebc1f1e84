The protocols are not, in general, heirarchical; instead they are small building blocks at the top level that can be fitted together.<br>&gt;  3. Protocols are split when a good default implementation cannot be provided, e.g. CountableCollection is seperate because the default of iterating and<br>&gt;     counting the elements is not a good implimentation of count.<br>&gt;  4. Hierarchies are used for convenience, e.g. ArrayCollection is a convenience protocol that extends base protocols.<br>&gt;  5. The protocol member&#39;s return generic implementations of protocols, e.g. where you might return an Array instead you return an `AnyNextorable&lt;Element&gt;`.<br>&gt;     This sidesteps issues with associated types and generics and prevents large type signatures. The downside is that you have comitted to a particular<br>&gt;     interface and therefore lost covariance. When generics are completed hopefully these return types can be replaced with `Any&lt;... where ...&gt;`, e.g. `Any<br>&gt;     &lt;Nextorable where Element == Element&gt;`<br>&gt;  6. LazyNextable is split out seperately so that the semantics of lazy are articulated in the type system. The design of LazyNextable is also compatible<br>&gt;     with adding ParallelLazyNextable in the future.<br>&gt;  7. The naming of the protocols is one of:<br>&gt;      1. Xxxable because it is a main behavioural protocol and its main member is xxx, e.g. Nextorable has a main property nextor.<br>&gt;      2. If in the rare case that a protocol extends another protocol then the new property is prepended, e.g. MutableSubstriptable extends Substriptable<br>&gt;         and the main method added is mutable subscripting.<br>&gt;      3. If they don&#39;t have a main member then they are named after what they are used for, e.g. ArrayCollection defines the members of Array like<br>&gt;         collections. Note name format of XxxCollection.<br>&gt;      4. AnyXxxx is a type erased implimentation of Xxx, e.g. AnyLazyNextable is an erased LazyNextable.<br>&gt;      5. Xxxee and xxxee is used for the subject of an action, e.g. Rangee is a collection of methods that a type must impliment to be used in a Range.<br>&gt;  8. Range has an Int index of 0 to count - 1 and a value of start + index * stride, where start and stride are of type Rangee. Int and Double via extension<br>&gt;     are made Rangees.<br>&gt;  9. Index, used in Subscriptables, can be any type.<br></p><p>Let&#39;s cut to the chase: what problem are you trying to solve, and how<br>does your proposal address that problem?<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10d0339242a000b0b683ed1d5e25a110?s=50"></div><header><strong>Bike-shedding alternate collections API</strong> from <string>Howard Lovatt</string> &lt;howard.lovatt at gmail.com&gt;<p>March 25, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>Detailed comments about iterator inline below.<br></p><p>Big picture is:<br></p><p>Separating lazy collections from eager collection with a view to a future world with lazy parallel collections.<br>Returning AnyXxx rather than a specific type to both keep types short and to be more flexible.<br>Removing constraints on Index, useful for linked lists etc.<br>Changing the way Range works to that it plays nicer with a larger range of types; range[index] = start + index * stride<br>Flattening the hierarchy, to allow a mix and match approach to features for more flexibility.<br></p><p>Saying problem to be solved is too strong.
