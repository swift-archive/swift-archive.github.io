Prototyping an implementation and its uses along with the proposal is encouraged, because it helps ensure both technical feasibility of the proposal as well as validating that the proposal solves the problems it is meant to solve.<br>Request a review: initiate a pull request to the swift-evolution repository &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution&gt; to indicate to the core team that you would like the proposal to be reviewed. When the proposal is sufficiently detailed and clear, and addresses feedback from earlier discussions of the idea, the pull request will be accepted. The proposal will be assigned a proposal number as well as a core team member to manage the review.<br>Address feedback: in general, and especially during the review period &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/schedule.md#review&gt;, be responsive to questions and feedback about the proposal.<br></p><p>	- Doug<br></p><p><br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151204/6c3fd914/attachment-0001.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
