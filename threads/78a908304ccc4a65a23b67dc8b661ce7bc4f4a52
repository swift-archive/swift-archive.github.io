We want to to make the cross-platform Foundation API<br>&gt;&gt; that is available as part of swift-corelibs feel like it is not tied<br>&gt;&gt; to just Darwin targets. We also want to reinforce the idea that new<br>&gt;&gt; Foundation API must fit in with the language, standard library, and<br>&gt;&gt; the rapidly evolving design patterns we see in the community.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; You challenged us on one part of this plan: some Foundation API just<br>&gt;&gt; doesn’t “feel Swifty”, and a large part of the reason why is that it<br>&gt;&gt; often does not have the same value type behavior as other Swift<br>&gt;&gt; types. We took this feedback seriously, and I would like to share<br>&gt;&gt; with you the start of an important journey for some of the most<br>&gt;&gt; commonly used APIs on all of our platforms: adopting value semantics<br>&gt;&gt; for key Foundation types.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; We have been working on this for some time now, and the set of diffs<br>&gt;&gt; that result from this change is large. At this point, I am going to<br>&gt;&gt; focus effort on an overview of the high level goals and not the<br>&gt;&gt; individual API of each new type. In order to focus on delivering<br>&gt;&gt; something up to our quality standards, we are intentionally leaving<br>&gt;&gt; some class types as-is until a future proposal. If you don’t see<br>&gt;&gt; your favorite class on the list — don’t despair. We are going to<br>&gt;&gt; iterate on this over time. I see this as the start of the process.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; One process note: we are still trying to figure out the best way to<br>&gt;&gt; integrate changes to API that ship as part of the operating system<br>&gt;&gt; (which includes Foundation) into the swift-evolution review<br>&gt;&gt; process. Swift-evolution is normally focused on changes to<br>&gt;&gt; functionality in the compiler or standard library. In general, I<br>&gt;&gt; don’t expect all new Foundation API introduced in the<br>&gt;&gt; Darwin/Objective-C framework to go through the open source<br>&gt;&gt; process. However, as we’ve brought up this topic here before, I felt<br>&gt;&gt; it was important to bring this particular change to the<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution list.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; As always I welcome your feedback.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0069-swift-mutability-for-foundation.md<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br>&gt;&gt; - Tony<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
