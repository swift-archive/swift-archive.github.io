The final<br>&gt; draft is a significant improvement.  I am mostly +1, with a couple of<br>&gt; minor critiques.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I think this proposal pushes a bit too hard on consistency of “first /<br>&gt; last” vs “prefix / suffix”.  Specifically, I think first(n) and<br>&gt; last(n) are significantly more clear than prefix(n) and suffix(n) (and<br>&gt; removingFirst(n) / removingLast(n) instead of removingPrefix(n) /<br>&gt; removingSuffix(n).  I think the former are immediately clear.  The<br>&gt; latter, while consistent in terms of matching semantics with a naming<br>&gt; convention suffer in terms of clarity at the call site.  I do not<br>&gt; think it is immediately clear that the parameter specifies the<br>&gt; *length* of the prefix or suffix.  <br></p><p>+1, and it doesn&#39;t: it specifies the *maximum length*.<br></p><p>&gt; removingPrefix(ofLength: n) would solve the clarity issue at the<br>&gt; expense of verbosity.  I would prefer we just keep first / last in<br>&gt; these cases.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Another comment is that you have generally moved index based methods<br>&gt; to subscripts rather than named methods.  Why didn’t you take this all<br>&gt; the way and change `replaceSubrange` to be a subscript setter?<br></p><p>The language doesn&#39;t allow it:<br></p><p>1. replaceSubrange is generic on the sequence argument and we don&#39;t have<br>   generic subscript<br></p><p>2. you&#39;d need to have a matching subscript getter, and there would be no<br>   way to deduce the result in most cases, potentially causing<br>   ambiguity.  I dunno, maybe this could work, but we&#39;d need to solve<br>   problem 1 before we could find out.<br></p><p><br>&gt;&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes, the new names have more consistency.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar<br>&gt;&gt; feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I don’t believed I have used any languages that emphasize consistent<br>&gt; naming and API guidelines as strongly as Swift.  This is a good<br>&gt; direction.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A relatively quick read.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Thank you,<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; -Chris Lattner<br>&gt;&gt; Review Manager<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
