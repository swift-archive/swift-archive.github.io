I’ve looked for help in the developer forums to no avail…I’ve TRIED to make sense of what documentation I could find provided by Apple to no avail.  Ya see, my class had barely begun to touch Objective-C when Swift was officially released out of beta. The class immediately jumped to Swift. I have found a few online courses that say they teach what I need to know but I just don’t have confidence in these classes. Must I learn Objective-C to accomplish this?? Or does anyone here have any feasible solution to offer as advice?? If I had known that this precious skill would not be taught to me at this school, I would have sought alternatives. A rep at Apple told me that she knew of ONE school that was definitely teaching this material…of course it is out of my state and I cannot afford to go there, not even for 1 class to learn what I seek. I am in Texas.<br>Thanks in advance for any help :) <br></p><p><br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-corelibs-dev/attachments/20160808/df3cb847/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/06e1007412a9c7c2dc41297c9cf99a5d?s=50"></div><header><strong>in-app purchase</strong> from <string>Shawn Erickson</string> &lt;shawnce at gmail.com&gt;<p>August  9, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>This isn&#39;t likely a good list for this discussion maybe Swift users but<br>more likely the Apple developer forums would be better.
