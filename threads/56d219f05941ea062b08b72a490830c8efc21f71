The instruction was intended to make representation and optimization of closures easy by avoiding concretization of the closure type and layout, but in practice, the complexity of dealing with ARC and the differing ownership needs for closure objects vs normal function arguments makes the abstraction unwieldy to understand and work with. As we look into adding new features that rely on static analysis and optimization of SIL, such as the borrow model, partial_apply is going to be a continuing drag on development.

I&#39;m using the existing infrastructure for @box types in SIL to represent a closure allocation, using tuples to aggregate multiple captures. This is enough to get a start on the project, but there a few limitations and inefficiencies to this approach, and I wanted some feedback on how to tackle these problems:<br></p><p>(A) Aggregating contexts as tuples imposes some unnecessary abstraction limitations on capture layout, and would potentially force otherwise unnecessary metadata instantiation for tuple types. Tuples need to tolerate potentially being accessed as fully generic (T, U, V) types (and possibly variadic (T...) types, should we add variadics in the future), which limits the layout optimizations we can potentially do with them. Closure contexts don&#39;t need to support generic abstraction, since the details of layout only need to be known by the closure&#39;s invocation function and its enclosing scope, so we should have full freedom for layout optimization like we have with structs and classes.<br>(B) Boxed tuples can&#39;t represent captured type information for forming closures in generic contexts. Closure contexts need to be able to provide type metadata to the invocation function for execution of generic code and layout of the context object itself.<br></p><p>One idea I&#39;m entertaining is, instead of relying on structural box types, to introduce &quot;nominal&quot; box layouts, which can give an identity to a particular closure layout, thereby addressing problem (A), and can potentially carry a generic signature to represent captured type metadata, addressing (B). For example, in code like this:<br></p><p>	var escaper: () -&gt; ()<br>	func foo(x: Bool, y: Bool) {<br>	  escaper = { _ = x; _ = y }<br>	}<br></p><p>We&#39;d emit something like this SIL:<br></p><p>	// Closure layout for closure inside foo<br>	sil_box_layout foo.1 {<br>	  let x: Bool<br>	  let y: Bool<br>	}<br></p><p>	sil @foo : $(Bool, Bool) -&gt; () {<br>	entry(%x : $Bool, %y : $Bool):<br>	  // Allocate a box with the layout for this closure<br>	  %context = alloc_box foo.1<br>	  // Initialize the members<br>	  %context.x = project_box %context, #x<br>	  store %x to %context.x<br>	  %context.y = project_box %context, #y<br>	  store %y to %closure.y<br>	  // Bind to the invocation function<br>	  %closure = partial_apply @foo.1(%closure)<br>	  assign %closure to @escaper<br>	  return<br>	}<br></p><p>	// Invocation function for the closure<br>	sil @foo.1 : $(@box foo.1) -&gt; () {<br>	entry(%context : $@box foo.1):<br>	  // Load captured locals out of context<br>	  %context.x = project_box %context, #x<br>	  %x = load %context.x<br>	  %context.y = project_box %context, #y<br>	  %y = load %context.y<br>	  // do nothing<br>	  release %context<br>	  return<br>	}<br></p><p>The unique box layout gives us license to pack those bools into a single word, or a tagged pointer, or do other fancy layout optimizations.
