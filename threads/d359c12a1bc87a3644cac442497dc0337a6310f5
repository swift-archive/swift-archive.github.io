Or should I resubmit them?<br></p><p>The two in question were:<br>https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/366<br>https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/367<br></p><p>But there are other previously out of scope issues I&#39;m interested in as well.<br></p><p>Also, is there a description somewhere of exactly what&#39;s in scope for the next stage? The front-page for the swift-evolution github project seems to still be focused on Swift 3.0, is there a permanent description somewhere?
