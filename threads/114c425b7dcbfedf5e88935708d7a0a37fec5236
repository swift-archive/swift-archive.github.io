I think that overall it’s a step in the right direction.<br></p><p> * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift? <br></p><p>A function that never returns is fundamentally different from any other function.  Having this property captured in the function type - rather than additional meta-programming attributes - makes sense.  It also prevents the language users from creating nonsensical function signatures, such as @noreturn func test() -&gt; Int (which happily compiles and runs fine in XCode 8).<br></p><p>The NoReturn type has precedence in both computer science theory and modern general purpose programming languages.  I suspect a more generally named universal bottom type would be more &quot;future-proof&quot;, but I have no strong opinion on the matter.<br></p><p>While this is a breaking change, it affects a small corner of the language.  I see the benefit outweighing the cost.<br></p><p> * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift? <br></p><p>Yes.<br></p><p> * If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those? <br></p><p>I am aware of the existence of the bottom type in Scala and Rust, but I haven’t worked with them.<br></p><p> * How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>A quick review, as well as a quick scan through the literature.<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
