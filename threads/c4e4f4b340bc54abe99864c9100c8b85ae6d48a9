The &quot;XC&quot; prefix here is part of a disambiguating namespace for the different xUnit testing frameworks:<br></p><p>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit<br>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks#Swift<br></p><p>Even way down the track, dropping the prefix makes no sense to me. (Moving to a completely new testing framework with a completely different name - that&#39;s not impossible, but also an entirely different kettle of fish, and not one that I think anyone need concern themselves with.)<br></p><p>Cheers,<br>M.<br>-- <br>Mark Glossop<br>E: lists at cueballcentral.com<br>TW: http://twitter.com/Cueball_AU<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>Changing the name of XCTest* to Test*</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>February 27, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; I’d propose that it’s important/core enough to warrant changing from “XCTestCase” to “Swift.TestCase&quot; (et al) or something very similar.<br></p><p>`Swift.` would mean XCTest had been merged into the standard library, which I don&#39;t think is something we should do.<br></p><p>We could drop the `XC` prefixes from the APIs, giving us e.g. `XCTest.TestCase`; that might be a good idea.
