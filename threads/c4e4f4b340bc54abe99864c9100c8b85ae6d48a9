The &quot;XC&quot; prefix here is part of a disambiguating namespace for the different xUnit testing frameworks:<br></p><p>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit<br>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks#Swift<br></p><p>Even way down the track, dropping the prefix makes no sense to me.
