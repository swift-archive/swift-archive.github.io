At the call site, a first parameter that has no argument label must<br>&gt; &gt;     form part of a grammatical phrase that starts with the basename, less<br>&gt; &gt;     any trailing nouns.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;       print(x)<br>&gt; &gt;       a.contains(b)<br>&gt; &gt;       a.mergeWith(b)<br>&gt; &gt;       a.addGestureRecognizer(x)<br>&gt; &gt;            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ trailing noun<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     This phrase must have the correct semantic implications, so, e.g.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;       a.dismiss(b)           // no, unless a is really dismissing b<br>&gt; &gt;       a.dismissAnimated(b)   // no, not grammatical<br>&gt; &gt;       a.dismiss(animated: b) // yes, using a label<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Skip parameter labels when the first argument completes a grammatically<br>&gt; meaningful phrase starting with the base name (and apart from trailing<br>&gt; nouns).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;       a.dismiss(b)           // Not unless a is really dismissing some<br>&gt; instance of b<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  2. If the first argument is part of a prepositional phrase, put the<br>&gt; &gt;     parenthesis immediately after the preposition.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;       a.encodeWith(b)<br>&gt; &gt;       a.moveFrom(b, to: c)<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;     Thus, if words are required for any reason between the preposition<br>&gt; &gt;     and the first argument, they go into the first argument label.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;       a.tracksWith(mediaType: b, composer: c)<br>&gt; &gt;       a.moveTo(x: 22, y: 99)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; When using prepositional phrases, use parentheses after the preposition.<br>&gt; Place any supporting words into first argument labels.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; a.dismissUsing(animation: b)<br>&gt; a.tracksOf(mediaType: b, composer: c)<br>&gt; a.moveTo(x: 22, y: 99)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; AGAINST: this worked better with your &quot;creating new instance rule&quot; and<br>&gt; should probably be called out as such. I&#39;d like to see the &quot;if it works<br>&gt; like an initializer it should be named with initializer label&quot; bits come<br>&gt; back.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; a.colorWith(red: r, green: g, blue: b, alpha: a)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I think this should probably be:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; a.color(red:, green:, blue:, alpha:)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Notes:<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; a. I would recommend prepositions other than &quot;with&quot; in nearly all<br>&gt; &gt;   cases, but that&#39;s not the point of these rules.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; When using &quot;with&quot; as your go-to preposition, carefully consider whether<br>&gt; other more meaningful prepositions could apply. &quot;With&quot; tends to describe<br>&gt; use at a call site rather than method or function semantics.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; b. I can understand the aesthetic appeal of<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;    a.move(from: b, to: c)<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   but I believe it is not a clear enough improvement to justify<br>&gt; &gt;   additional complexity in the guidelines.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; When the natural semantic relationship between the arguments  is stronger<br>&gt; than the relationship between the method name and the first argument, use<br>&gt; first argument labels, whether the label is a noun or a preposition:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; a.move(from: b, to: c)<br>&gt; a.login(username: b, password: c)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -- E, always attempting to be helpful, but understanding your frustration<br>&gt; at getting this kind of feedback<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Questions:<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 1.

Calling copyWithZone() directly isn’t completely unheard of, actually; if an object is implementing its own copyWithZone() method and one of its properties conforms to NSCopying, it may well call copyWithZone() to do the copy, because it’s already got this zone pointer right here, and hey, why not.

I&#39;m not expecting these guidelines to make everybody optimally happy,<br>&gt;   all the time, but they shouldn&#39;t be harmful.  Are there any cases for<br>&gt;   which they produce results you couldn&#39;t live with?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2. Are there any cases where you&#39;d be confused about how to apply these<br>&gt;   guidelines?<br></p><p>I do find some of the rules worded in ways that are hard to apply in the presence of trailing nouns; I’m not sure the guidelines are strong enough here to force the “right” outcome.<br></p><p>Consider this example:<br></p><p>// not-intended: <br>a.tracksWithMediaCharacteristic(b, composer: c)<br></p><p>…applying our guidelines:<br></p><p>- `tracks with media characteristic b` is a grammatical phrase<br>- `tracks with b` is (arguably also) a grammatical phrase<br>- `b` is “part of” the &quot;noun phrase&quot; &quot;tracks with media characteristic b&quot;<br>- `b` is “part of” the “prepositional phrase” “with media characteristic b&quot;<br></p><p>…and although I think this is fine under a “strict” application of the guidelines—as `b` is part of a prepositional phrase, we *must* split the base name after the preposition, at which point we are allowed to “restore&quot; the `mediaCharacteristic:` label if we wish—I don’t know in practice that the “strict” interpretation will be what people naturally opt to use.<br></p><p>Taking it from the other direction, the way the guidelines are phrased I worry bit that you wind up with:<br></p><p>// not intended<br>a.add(subview: v) (or add(v)) // instead of `a.addSubview(v)`<br>a.add(layoutGuide: g) (or add(g)) // instead of `a.addLayoutGuide(g)`<br>a.add(gestureRecognizer: r) (or add(r)) // instead of `a.addGestureRecognizer(r)`<br></p><p>…b/c the rule that we should ignore such trailing nouns means those are *exactly* as-grammatical as the “intended” imports (it’s “add v” vs “add v”, after all, under the guidelines), so at least within the proposed guidelines there’s no apparent reason to prefer the `addSubview` form vis-a-vis the `add(subview:)` (or `add(_)`) form(s).<br></p><p>Perhaps I just overlooked something from the non-label guidelines in this response, but it’d seem the omit-needless-words would also steer you towards `add()`, with or without a first-argument label.<br></p><p>So overall these guidelines seem more than adequate to resolve labeling disputes if we are already dealing with &quot;well-named” functions but may be a bit weak to steer naming *decisions*.<br></p><p>But, for guidelines, that might still be OK?<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks in advance for all your valuable input!<br>&gt; <br>&gt; P.S.
