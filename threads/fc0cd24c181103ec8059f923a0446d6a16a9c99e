They&#39;re simple and, in the end, exactly the same as normal string literals. They begin and end with triple quotes, can contain newlines, can contain single quotes, and that&#39;s all that&#39;s special in their parsing. The same block of code in Lexer.cpp could be used for both types of literal, ensuring behavior is always consistent regardless of any future changes.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; There is also the potential suggestion of removing consistent indentation if there is any so as to make formatting of a multi-line string literal look more clean when indented. For me, it would be a nice to have, but not a make or break feature... and for some it may be confusing.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;d like to state that I&#39;m not proposing heredoc-style functionality, as I believe that to be an entirely separate feature. The potential to have one heredoc embedded within another would certainly make parsing more painful than i&#39;m happy with.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; For an example of code that would benefit significantly from multi-line string literals, please look at docopt.swift: https://github.com/docopt/docopt.swift/blob/master/Examples/Swift/arguments_example/main.swift#L9-L25 &lt;https://github.com/docopt/docopt.swift/blob/master/Examples/Swift/arguments_example/main.swift#L9-L25&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Docopt does the opposite of what most command line argument libraries do: rather than defining options and auto-generating the help text based on that... You write the help text and it auto-generates a CLI with exactly those options and arguments. It makes writing CLI applications an absolute pleasure, but without multi-line string literals in swift it&#39;s currently less pleasant than it could be.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Please send me your thoughts. ^_^b<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Travis Tilley<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151210/59949df4/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e734178c34abfc2c481e797a491dd2b?s=50"></div><header><strong>multi-line string literals</strong> from <string>Travis Tilley</string> &lt;ttilley at gmail.com&gt;<p>December 10, 2015 at 09:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Thu, Dec 10, 2015 at 8:41 PM, Chris Lattner &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;<br>&gt; 1) What concrete syntax should be used?

This would make most sense with a heredoc style syntax where the terminator is a very specific string.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I also have no use for specifying a dialect for a string, which Jordan Rose suggests is useful for shaders, and have no idea how to implement such a feature.<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151214/7230d33e/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>multi-line string literals</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>December 14, 2015 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Dec 14, 2015, at 12:35 PM, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Dec 10, 2015, at 11:07 PM, Travis Tilley &lt;ttilley at gmail.com &lt;mailto:ttilley at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Chris - due to the complexity involved, would it make sense to have multiple proposals?

This syntax solves a number of problems that<br>&quot;are common in other language&#39;s implementations of multiline Strings. This syntax is meant to be a<br>&quot;a generalization of regular Swift literal Strings, whereby a String is considered to begin with an open quote<br>&quot;and continue indefinitely until and including the end of the line (newline character),<br>&quot;or the String is closed with an ending quote.<br>&quot;<br>&quot;Firstly, indentation is now very clear and explicit. It is easy to see what the resulting string will be.<br>&quot;   This is one level of indentation.<br>&quot;       This is two levels.<br>&quot;<br>&quot;Secondly, there is no need for newline character processesing since it is well defined what newline behavior<br>&quot;should be.<br>&quot;<br>&quot;If a newline should be present in the code, but not in the resulting String it can be escaped with &#39;\\&#39; \<br>&quot; like so.<br>&quot;<br>&quot;Alternatively, perhaps that behavior could be left out and still accomplished by appending Strings in the<br>&quot; normal way with + or implicitly concatonated by the complier. Like so:<br>&quot; This is a long single line literal String. This is a long single line literal String. This is a long single&quot;<br>&quot;line literal String.&quot;<br>&quot;<br>&quot;Thirdly, the indent level of these strings is decoupled from the indent level of the code, since there is a<br>        &quot;well defined starting point for the String on each line.<br>    &quot;   Thus you can indent the code and the string independently.<br>&quot;<br>&quot;Lastly, I don&#39;t actually know if this is even possible to implement. I don&#39;t know if these creates ambiguities<br>&quot;for the compiler, but it doesn&#39;t seem like it does at first glance.<br></p><p>This would require that adjacent Strings are automatically appended to each other by the compiler, (e.g. let x = “blah” “blah”, would be valid and x would equal “blahblah”. I don’t know how others would feel about something like this, but I’ve always wanted this behavior in multiline Strings.

This syntax solves a number of problems that<br>&gt; &quot;are common in other language&#39;s implementations of multiline Strings. This syntax is meant to be a<br>&gt; &quot;a generalization of regular Swift literal Strings, whereby a String is considered to begin with an open quote<br>&gt; &quot;and continue indefinitely until and including the end of the line (newline character),<br>&gt; &quot;or the String is closed with an ending quote.<br>&gt; &quot;<br>&gt; &quot;Firstly, indentation is now very clear and explicit. It is easy to see what the resulting string will be.<br>&gt; &quot;   This is one level of indentation.<br>&gt; &quot;       This is two levels.<br>&gt; &quot;<br>&gt; &quot;Secondly, there is no need for newline character processesing since it is well defined what newline behavior<br>&gt; &quot;should be.<br>&gt; &quot;<br>&gt; &quot;If a newline should be present in the code, but not in the resulting String it can be escaped with &#39;\\&#39; &lt;smb://&#39;&gt; \<br>&gt; &quot; like so.<br>&gt; &quot;<br>&gt; &quot;Alternatively, perhaps that behavior could be left out and still accomplished by appending Strings in the<br>&gt; &quot; normal way with + or implicitly concatonated by the complier. Like so:<br>&gt; &quot; This is a long single line literal String. This is a long single line literal String. This is a long single&quot;<br>&gt; &quot;line literal String.&quot;<br>&gt; &quot;<br>&gt; &quot;Thirdly, the indent level of these strings is decoupled from the indent level of the code, since there is a<br>&gt;         &quot;well defined starting point for the String on each line.<br>&gt;     &quot;   Thus you can indent the code and the string independently.<br>&gt; &quot;<br>&gt; &quot;Lastly, I don&#39;t actually know if this is even possible to implement. I don&#39;t know if these creates ambiguities<br>&gt; &quot;for the compiler, but it doesn&#39;t seem like it does at first glance.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This would require that adjacent Strings are automatically appended to each other by the compiler, (e.g. let x = “blah” “blah”, would be valid and x would equal “blahblah”. I don’t know how others would feel about something like this, but I’ve always wanted this behavior in multiline Strings.

One syntax need not fulfill the needs of every use case. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I’m not sure how to interpret this question.  Are you asking whether a proposal should start out simple, then have new things piled on top of it?  Or are you suggesting it would be better to have multiple new language features solving different problems?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; In this case, my personal preference is to have a really well thought out long term vision for what we are doing in this space, and then subset the implementation to start with the simple pieces.  This avoids painting ourselves into a corner.  Further, I really hope we can avoid adding N new string literal syntaxes.  I see the existing one as the “simple” case, and the multiline case as the “advanced” case which can have knobs put on it for other advanced uses.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Catching up with the rest of this thread, here’s what I’d suggest:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; - Please don’t extend simple “foo” strings to multiple lines.<br>&gt;&gt; - The ``` syntax is actually pretty interesting, I think that exploring it makes sense.  “”” doesn’t seem problematic to me though.<br>&gt;&gt; - Please consider ways that the string can have extensible options applied to it.  I haven’t thought much about this space, but the &quot;String literal suffixes for defining types” has some interesting ideas (though using prefixes instead of suffixes seems appealing as was pointed out in some email). <br>&gt;&gt; - I completely agree with Brent’s observation that we shouldn’t optimize for multi-line literals embedded into the middle of some other large expression.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The “configuration” aspect of this feature has come up several times.  It seems clear that the multi line literal has some obvious strong defaults: leading whitespace should be stripped, and escapes should be processed (including interpolation).  That said, being able to disable these independent of each other is important, and there are lots of other behaviors that can be considered as well.  I consider it a good thing for these behaviors to be explicit in the code.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; As a strawman proposal (i.e. don’t take it seriously) to illustrate what I mean, you could use attributes for this, e.g. something like:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; let foo = @disable_escape_processing ```<br>&gt;&gt; blah <br>&gt;&gt; blah<br>&gt;&gt;  blah```<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; -Chris<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151214/058378bd/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e734178c34abfc2c481e797a491dd2b?s=50"></div><header><strong>multi-line string literals</strong> from <string>Travis Tilley</string> &lt;ttilley at gmail.com&gt;<p>December 11, 2015 at 03:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>I am going to wait until friday the 18th to submit a formal swift-evolution<br>review for this feature.

You do not want to plop enormous multi-line string constants in the<br>&gt;&gt; middle of expressions. This makes the expressions impossible to read.<br>&gt;&gt; Instead, you want a placeholder for the string in the expression, and then<br>&gt;&gt; the string on a separate line.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 2. Having said that, when there are several placeholders, you also want<br>&gt;&gt; it to be obvious which text goes with which placeholder.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 3. You want a syntax which clearly indicates which indentation is meant<br>&gt;&gt; to line up the string literal with the code, and which is meant to be *in*<br>&gt;&gt; the string literal.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; With these principles in mind, I suggest something like:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;         onMessage(DAVE&gt;, sendMessage: HAL&gt;)<br>&gt;&gt;         DAVE&gt;Open the pod bay doors,<br>&gt;&gt;         DAVE&gt;   HAL!<br>&gt;&gt;         HAL&gt;I’m sorry, Dave,<br>&gt;&gt;         HAL&gt;    I’m afraid I can’t<br>&gt;&gt;         HAL&gt;    do that.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; A multiline literal reference consists of an identifier followed by a<br>&gt;&gt; closing angle bracket in postfix operator position. After the end of any<br>&gt;&gt; statement containing a multiline literal reference, Swift starts looking<br>&gt;&gt; for the actual multiline literals mentioned in that statement. Leading<br>&gt;&gt; whitespace is consumed and discarded up to a matching identifier and angle<br>&gt;&gt; bracket; the text on the line after the literal, up to the newline, is the<br>&gt;&gt; text of the literal. Once Swift encounters a line that doesn’t start with<br>&gt;&gt; whitespace, an identifier, and an angle bracket, it switches back to<br>&gt;&gt; looking for ordinary statements.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; (By the way, the all-caps is a stylistic suggestion, not a requirement,<br>&gt;&gt; and I’m not at all sure it’s the *right* stylistic suggestion.)<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; As a shorthand for lines with only one string, you might be able to say:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;         sendMessage(_&gt;)<br>&gt;&gt;         &gt;I’m sorry, Dave,<br>&gt;&gt;         &gt;       I’m afraid I can’t<br>&gt;&gt;         &gt;       do that.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; While this solves the indentation problem, it doesn’t answer the question<br>&gt;&gt; of whether the trailing \n is part of the literal. I think it is. I’m<br>&gt;&gt; actually tempted to say that *all* newlines are ignored and you need \n if<br>&gt;&gt; you want a real newline, but that seems like it would do a lot of violence<br>&gt;&gt; to the entire concept of a multiline literal.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; --<br>&gt;&gt; Brent Royal-Gordon<br>&gt;&gt; Architechies<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151211/fabdb8aa/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>multi-line string literals</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>December 11, 2015 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; I&#39;m not entirely sure how to respond to this, but I think some of your suggestions might go against the goal of having less noise in defining a multi-line string.
