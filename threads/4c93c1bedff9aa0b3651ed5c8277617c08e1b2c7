I could imagine Set and Dictionary indices cannot be easily validated in comparison to Array indices. However this approach is more general and handles non trivial index collections where there is no guarantee that any index between startIndex and endIndex is a valid one.<br>The same arguments also apply to `subscript(checking range ...)` where you could validate start and endIndex of the range. <br></p><p>Best regards<br>Maximilian<br></p><p>&gt; Am 16.05.2016 um 09:45 schrieb Luis Henrique B.

I could imagine Set and Dictionary indices<br>&gt; cannot be easily validated in comparison to Array indices. However this<br>&gt; approach is more general and handles non trivial index collections where<br>&gt; there is no guarantee that any index between startIndex and endIndex is a<br>&gt; valid one.<br>&gt; The same arguments also apply to `subscript(checking range ...)` where you<br>&gt; could validate start and endIndex of the range.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Best regards<br>&gt; Maximilian<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Am 16.05.2016 um 09:45 schrieb Luis Henrique B.

I could imagine Set and Dictionary indices cannot be easily validated in comparison to Array indices. However this approach is more general and handles non trivial index collections where there is no guarantee that any index between startIndex and endIndex is a valid one.<br>&gt;&gt; The same arguments also apply to `subscript(checking range ...)` where you could validate start and endIndex of the range. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Best regards<br>&gt;&gt; Maximilian<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Am 16.05.2016 um 09:45 schrieb Luis Henrique B.

It now uses `clamped(to:)` as suggested by @Nate -- I think it<br>does look much more elegant. :-)<br></p><p>You can see the current code, run and test it from here:<br>https://swiftlang.ng.bluemix.net/#/repl/578ccabaf0ebe4d91be1e605<br></p><p>Considering that there were some other threads and drafts around this very<br>subject, more feedback and discussion are required on this idea. Even with<br>the new Range.clamped(to:) method, I still think that this addition could<br>be handy and useful. I do know that it is a very simple extension and that<br>it doesn&#39;t do much behind the scenes, but I would like to have it available<br>and ready to use when convenient.<br></p><p>Furthermore, it&#39;s not all about the &quot;syntax sugar&quot; aspect, it&#39;s something<br>to discuss when the fail-fast perspective doesn&#39;t apply directly, when the<br>operation doesn&#39;t necessarily causes a bug if it fails, when we&#39;d rather<br>have the subscript method executing &quot;safely&quot; (controversial term, but you<br>got my point) than the application crashing in runtime.<br></p><p>There are many cases where I have to add extra code with operations and<br>validations in order to get subarrays or an element in a specific position.<br>For example, given an application with some sort of &quot;top 5&quot;, currently I<br>must be careful and check the array size beforehand. I would rather avoid<br>that and take advantage of a more intuitive and clear solution e.g.<br>`records[clamping:<br>0..&lt;5]`, instead of validating that the array is not empty and then<br>returning something like `records.count &gt; 5 ? records[0..&lt;5] :<br>records[0..records.count]`.<br></p><p>tl;dr;<br></p><p>After all, I&#39;m just seeking a behaviour that could be compared to what we<br>have for dictionaries when trying to get the value for a non-existing key:<br></p><p>let dict = [&quot;a&quot;: 1, &quot;b&quot;: 2]<br>*&gt; dict[&quot;c&quot;] // nil*<br></p><p>let array = [1,2,3]<br>*&gt; array[5] // fatal error: index out of range*<br>*&gt; array[0..&lt;5] // fatal error: index out of range*<br></p><p>with this proposal:<br>*&gt; array[checking: 5] // nil*<br>*&gt; array[checking: 0..&lt;5] // nil (Optional)*<br>*&gt; array[clamping: 0..&lt;5] // [1,2,3] (clamped to bounds)*<br></p><p>Regards,<br>Luis<br></p><p>On Tue, May 17, 2016 at 11:54 PM, Nate Cook &lt;nate at natecook.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;<br>&gt; On May 17, 2016, at 5:18 PM, Luis Henrique B.
