It not only improves the Swift bridging immensely, it actually improves the Objective-C APIs by making them more descriptive in a fairly natural way. It&#39;s easy for me to imagine a future version of clang warning about implicit conversions between `swift_wrapper` typedefs, which would improve even pure Objective-C code.<br></p><p>Actually, if I have one objection to this proposal, it&#39;s that the clang guys should probably take a look at it and see if they want to do something to `typedef` that helps both languages. I&#39;d be willing to lose the `enum` feature, for instance, if this were instead an `__attribute__((newtype))` which affected both Swift and C family languages.<br></p><p>I also like that this is *not* some magic that happens in the API notes, but something that goes directly into the headers which you can use yourself.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. The type weaknesses of stringly typed Objective-C APIs affect Swift API names; to use an example mentioned in the proposal, the guidelines suggest the &quot;Identifier&quot; should be dropped when `-quantityTypeForIdentifier:` is bridged to Swift, but this isn&#39;t possible when the parameter is an untyped `String`.<br></p><p>Having said that, this isn&#39;t *as* high a priority as some of the other things planned for Swift 3. If we find we need to defer something, this proposal is a good candidate.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Absolutely. Anything that strengthens the typing of bridged APIs improves their Swiftiness, and a lot of Swift code interoperates with Objective-C.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>I&#39;ve never used automatic bridging which added type information like this, but I have been known to use type trickery to add type information which is not technically required in both Objective-C and Swift. (For instance, I previously wrote something like `NSLayoutAnchor` which used unnecessary protocols to keep you from accidentally mixing X and Y axis constraints.) Creating synthetic types purely to avoid mistakes is often very helpful.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>A quick reading. I did follow the original thread, though not all that closely.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/446db4307ac0d39e08cd818906ad7af8?s=50"></div><header><strong>Review: Import Objective-C Constants as Swift Types</strong> from <string>Curt Clifton</string> &lt;curt at curtclifton.net&gt;<p>February 18, 2016 at 08:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Proposal link:<br>    https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0033-import-objc-constants.md<br></p><p>	• What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>+1<br></p><p>This proposal is an improvement for both Objective-C and Swift/ObjC interop.<br></p><p>	• Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes.

I never liked these APIs that use strings for something that really should be a separate type, but I understand why they exist and I also wrote code like that myself. Having an API in Objective-C that takes string values is practical because NSStrings are often easier to deal with than primitives, e.g. putting them into containers like NSArray or NSDictionary. Swift doesn’t have those limitations, so it’s a good idea to use a separate, compiler-enforceable type.<br>Not to mention the benefit of having a self-documenting API.<br></p><p><br>&gt; 	• Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>I think so. Compiler-enforceable types, short but expressive names for constants and self-documenting APIs feel like Swift to me.<br>This also opens up the possibility to write an extension for the type in question, giving those enums or structs all kinds of convenience functionality. I tend to do this a lot in my Swift enums and structs.<br></p><p><br>&gt; 	• If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>No, I can’t think of a similar construct that I came across.<br></p><p><br>&gt; 	• How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>Just a quick reading the proposal and a good night’s sleep to think about it.<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd033b3ed46d65c7d7394eab52d53e6b?s=50"></div><header><strong>Review: Import Objective-C Constants as Swift Types</strong> from <string>Evan Maloney</string> &lt;emaloney at gilt.com&gt;<p>February 19, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; 	• What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>+1<br></p><p>This is an elegant solution to representing Objective-C APIs meaningfully in Swift.<br></p><p>With this feature, Swift source code looks more beautiful.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. Compiler-enforced type-safety is one of Swift&#39;s core benefits. Bugs that otherwise wouldn&#39;t be discovered until runtime are instead be caught up-front during the build. This will save lots of developers countless hours of debugging frustration!<br></p><p>&gt; 	• Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Yes, for the reasons above.<br></p><p>&gt; 	• How much effort did you put into your review?
