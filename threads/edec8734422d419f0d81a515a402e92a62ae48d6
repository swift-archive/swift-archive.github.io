I can&#39;t imagine how it&#39;d make<br>&gt; sense<br>&gt; &gt; to run CMake multiple times to build from one host for its own platform<br>&gt;<br>&gt; To build a Swift distribution, we need to build two pieces: the Swift<br>&gt; compiler and the standard library.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; When cross-compiling, you can build two different kinds of compilers:<br>&gt; a compiler that runs on your host machine, or the compiler that runs<br>&gt; on the target.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; To build the standard library, you need to use the Swift compiler that<br>&gt; runs on the host and a Clang that runs on the host, but both<br>&gt; configured to target your target platform.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Thus, if you want to cross-compile to Linux arm from OS X, you would<br>&gt; need to use two or three CMake invocations:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (1) to build a Swift compiler that runs on OS X,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (2) use (1) to build a standard library that runs on Linux arm,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (3) build a Swift compiler that runs on Linux arm.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; There is a dependency edge between (1) and (2), but they are in<br>&gt; different CMake invocations.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; When cross-compiling for iOS, tvOS and watchOS, there are many CMake<br>&gt; invocations of the second kind -- in fact, multiple for every platform<br>&gt; because of many slices.  And, even more, since those platforms use fat<br>&gt; libraries, there needs to be a step that creates them from separate<br>&gt; slices.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That&#39;s why I&#39;m comparing this to &quot;recursive make&quot;: if we use the CMake<br>&gt; approach to cross-compiling with multiple CMake invocations, since we<br>&gt; are building the compiler itself, we would be crating dependencies in<br>&gt; the graph that CMake does not know about, and we would require some<br>&gt; code to orchestrate the build.  Just like recursive make does in its<br>&gt; Makefiles.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Using build-script to orchestrate this build would be a natural<br>&gt; choice, but it would break many of the current workflows, where<br>&gt; developers rely on quickly iterating in one build directory, invoking<br>&gt; &#39;ninja check-swift&#39; directly to rebulid the compiler, all the<br>&gt; downstream dependencies, and run tests.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Dmitri<br>&gt;<br>&gt; --<br>&gt; main(i,j){for(i=2;;i++){for(j=2;j&lt;i;j++){if(!(i%j)){j=0;break;}}if<br>&gt; (j){printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,i);}}} /*Dmitri Gribenko &lt;gribozavr at gmail.com&gt;*/<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160119/7e5a6f57/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f82643a80c536e1ddf188d21826fc08?s=50"></div><header><strong>Cross-compile for Android armv7 from OSX</strong> from <string>Tom Birch</string> &lt;froody at gmail.com&gt;<p>January 20, 2016 at 09:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Tue, Jan 19, 2016 at 3:09 AM Dmitri Gribenko via swift-dev &lt;<br>swift-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; That&#39;s why I&#39;m comparing this to &quot;recursive make&quot;: if we use the CMake<br>&gt; approach to cross-compiling with multiple CMake invocations, since we<br>&gt; are building the compiler itself, we would be crating dependencies in<br>&gt; the graph that CMake does not know about, and we would require some<br>&gt; code to orchestrate the build.
