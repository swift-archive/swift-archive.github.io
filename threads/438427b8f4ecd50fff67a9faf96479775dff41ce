In some cases, the ability to easily approach problems in a deterministic low level way, as well as the wealth of existing code dealing with those problems, is how C and C++ are still very very relevant. The rest is increasingly dominated by JavaScript and Node where performance at a very low power is not critical.<br></p><p>C++ gives you rope to hang yourself with, but in capable hands it gives you all the knobs and levers you need to extract high performance with a very high degree of determinism. <br>Garbage collection, automatic reference counting, pass by copy value types with or without copy on write semantics, etc... there are several areas where other languages keep you abstracted from the hardware in a way that does not make performance predictable.<br>Memory fragmentation, control of allocations of stack and heap memory (preferably away from hot game loops), no extra performance hit when passing memory reference around or iterate on collections (yes people can destroy performance in not very obvious ways too).<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d8867167dba9b648c6d0746a67bbc721?s=50"></div><header><strong>Swift-based Metal Shading Language</strong> from <string>Goffredo Marocchi</string> &lt;panajev at gmail.com&gt;<p>July 10, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>Sent from my iPhone<br></p><p>On 10 Jul 2016, at 08:50, Georgios Moschovitis &lt;george.moschovitis at icloud.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; working on C++ compatibility/interaction is  still quite key because of the mountains of legacy and new code still written everyday in it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Totally agree, but C++ interoperability is orthogonal to my original request.
