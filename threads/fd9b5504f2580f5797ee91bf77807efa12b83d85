If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned on this mailing list, it&#39;s that the state of the art WRT to programming languages has changed a lot since I was in school, and, at least to me, it seems like the pace at which it’s changing is increasing as well. This was just an off-the-cuff idea for making the language as future-proof as possible. I don’t have an concrete examples, other than maybe “mixins”. I don’t know anything about them, other than their name seems misspelled to me. Would they even be a separate type of type, or would they get glued onto structs, enums, and classes?<br></p><p>Anyway, I just wanted to raise the issue before Swift 3 comes out, since with v3 we&#39;re aiming for source-compatibility going forward.<br></p><p>- Dave Sweeris (who is apparently trying to get the day’s quota for whacky ideas out of the way early :-) )<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160502/288b2f42/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cce5c4aaa87dd6df9c22ede21d5d1ed6?s=50"></div><header><strong>Should we rename &quot;class&quot; when referring to protocol conformance?</strong> from <string>Adrian Zubarev</string> &lt;adrian.zubarev at devandartist.com&gt;<p>May  3, 2016 at 06:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>+1 Yes please, get rid of the `class` keyword from protocols already and replace it with better implicit protocols.  <br></p><p>I posted the idea two weeks ago, but no one answered to it: https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160418/015568.html  <br></p><p>Replacing `class` with something like `protocol AnyReference` is the first step to add a few more implicit protocols like `AnyValue` to Swift.
