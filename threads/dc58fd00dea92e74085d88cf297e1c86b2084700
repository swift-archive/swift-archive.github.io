To recap, a `null_resettable` property in<br>&gt; Objective-C indicates that the getter returns a nonnull value, while<br>&gt; the setter is nullable:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; @property (nonatomic, nonnull, null_resettable) NSString *name;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; foo.name = @&quot;Bar&quot;;<br>&gt; foo.name = nil; // &quot;resets&quot; the property<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Currently these are imported as implicitly unwrapped optionals (var<br>&gt; name: String!), which is the same as if they were `null_unspecified`.<br>&gt; I believe this can be improved.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I&#39;ve drafted a proposal that would improve how these are imported. In<br>&gt; a nutshell, Swift would add an extra &quot;reset&quot; method to the imported<br>&gt; interface which would allow users to explicitly reset the property by<br>&gt; name. (The above example would be imported as `var name: String; func<br>&gt; resetName()`.) This would improve readability and allow the getter to<br>&gt; return a non-optional value.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That proposal is here:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; https://github.com/patters/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0000-importing-null_resettable.md<br>&gt;<br>&gt; However, I then wondered if this feature of Objective-C would be<br>&gt; advantageous to bring to Swift. The thought there is to allow Swift to<br>&gt; declare a property getter as a non-optional type, while allowing the<br>&gt; setter to take an optional type. While a syntactical change has more<br>&gt; cost to Swift, the benefit may outweigh that.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; There were a few ideas here but I ultimately settled on a new `set?`<br>&gt; operator. The proposal then details the usage and ramifications of<br>&gt; such a change. For example, the getter would continue to return `T`<br>&gt; while the type of `newValue` available in the setter becomes a `T?`.<br>&gt; There&#39;s a corresponding change to willSet clauses.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That proposal is here:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; https://github.com/patters/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0000-resettable-properties.md<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I think that both of these solve the problem in two different ways and<br>&gt; submit both for your discussion and consideration.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Thanks!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Jason Patterson<br>&gt; @patters<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>Two-for-Tuesday: Resettable Properties</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>March 16, 2016 at 08:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; SE-0030 initially included &quot;out-of-band operations&quot; (such as reset<br>&gt; methods with syntax like `foo.name.[resettable].reset()`) but<br>&gt; ultimately removed them due to complexities involved:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; It is useful to add out-of-band operations to a property that aren&#39;t normal members of its formal type, for instance, to cleara lazy property to be recomputed later, or to reset a property to an implementation-defined default value.

Where practicable, we usually break up large proposals into separate parts so that they can each be reviewed and implemented separately, particularly when a part of the design is underdeveloped or controversial. But that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;ve removed the feature, just that it&#39;s being designed separately.<br></p><p>Though the out-of-band operations feature was subsetted out of that particular proposal, that removal was only temporary.
