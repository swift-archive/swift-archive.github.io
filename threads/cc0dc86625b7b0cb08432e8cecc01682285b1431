When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:<br></p><p>	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br></p><p>	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br></p><p>Thank you,<br></p><p>-Chris Lattner<br>Review Manager<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
