To me there is no difference between `union<br>&gt;     ` and `formUnion`: both sounds functional-style, and actually the second one<br>&gt;     perhaps a bit more to my ears. There&#39;s basically two dictionary definitions<br>&gt;     of &quot;form&quot;:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     1. &quot;bring together parts or combine to create (something)&quot; which to me<br>&gt;     implies a new value is created, and<br>&gt;     2. &quot;make or fashion into a certain shape or form&quot; which would imply that the<br>&gt;     material you start with is transformed, which is apparently the intended<br>&gt;     meaning and also the reverse meaning from the above.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     I mean, doesn&#39;t this make sense as an API?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     let donut = baker.formDonut(dough) // non-mutating<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     Perhaps instead of &quot;form&quot; we could use &quot;become&quot; as a prefix when the<br>&gt;     operation is naturally described by a noun. That would seem less ambiguous<br>&gt;     to me:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     a.becomeUnion(b)<br>&gt;     a.becomeIntersection(b)<br>&gt;     a.becomeSuccessor(b)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     It&#39;s a bit passive, but I find it fits well when the operation is a noun.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     And there&#39;s no way the term lends itself to non-mutating cases without<br>&gt;     things becoming nonsensical:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     let donut = baker.becomeDonut(dough) // non-mutating?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I also am having difficulty coming to terms with the use of &quot;form&quot; (I<br>&gt; am a native English speaker). As you note &quot;form&quot; can imply the<br>&gt; creation of something from parts (more like assembling a new thing) as<br>&gt; well as the creation of something out of a material say a of block<br>&gt; clay (more like molding something out of an existing thing). It<br>&gt; doesn&#39;t seem clear cut to me to imply in place mutation.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Additionally my eyes / brain keep seeing &quot;from&quot; instead of<br>&gt; &quot;form&quot;. This type of issue is generally true with any short word made<br>&gt; up of the same set of letters (made worse since &quot;from&quot; is more common<br>&gt; in programming then &quot;form&quot;). The mind quickly narrows in on a set of<br>&gt; possible words given the letters we see and then uses context to help<br>&gt; get the correct one and/or additional visual parsing to understand the<br>&gt; exact ordering of letters (more energy expended). Anyway since I keep<br>&gt; seeing &quot;from&quot; instead of &quot;form&quot; I keep going in the direction of<br>&gt; thinking it returns something made from the two (or more) items<br>&gt; involved (not really sure why &quot;from&quot; goes that direction in my head,<br>&gt; it could also go the in place direction).<br></p><p>These are all good points.<br></p><p>&gt; I would prefer something other then &quot;form&quot; (note I just typed &quot;from&quot; by<br>&gt; mistake)... I think your suggestion of &quot;become&quot; has merit.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; y.becomeUnion(x) --reads to me as--&gt; &quot;y become union with x&quot;<br>&gt; y.formUnion(x) --read to me as--&gt; &quot;y from oops... y forming a union of x&quot;<br>&gt; y.becomeIntersection(x) --reads to me as--&gt; &quot;y become intersection with x&quot;<br>&gt; y.formIntersection(x) --read to me as--&gt; &quot;y from oops... y forming an<br>&gt; intersection with x&quot;<br></p><p>I don&#39;t like its verbosity, but it does solve the &quot;from&quot; problem.<br></p><p>&gt; In the &quot;forming&quot; situations it – to me – is ambiguous on if that is in<br>&gt; place or not. To me it implies more of giving something new back.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I am -1 on &quot;form&quot; aspect of this proposal. ...of course things are<br>&gt; learnable as long as things are fairly consistent and not to far out<br>&gt; of the norm for typical language use. Personally I don&#39;t see &quot;form&quot; as<br>&gt; that typical in English.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -Shawn<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
