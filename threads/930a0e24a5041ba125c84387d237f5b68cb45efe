If you don&#39;t use the result of a computation at all, it will likely be immediately released. You can use `withExtendedLifetime` to set a minimum bound for the lifetime of a reference:<br></p><p>withExtendedLifetime(RAII()) {<br>  print(&quot;Going out of scope&quot;)<br>}<br></p><p>&gt; (As an aside, I would like to see a deinit on a struct to support this technique as well.)<br></p><p>If structs support destructors, then they potentially also need to support copy constructors and all the other complexity of C++ to describe what happens when they get copied. Resources really do have referential identity in practice; classes are the appropriate way to model them.<br></p><p>-Joe<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151210/e6f5ddbd/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
