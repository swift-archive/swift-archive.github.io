The best path, since review has started, is probably to accept this proposal as-is.  Adding the implementations to the types themselves is necessary if the types are going to conform to a protocol that includes these initializers.  The upcoming Integer protocol proposal could incorporate them if desired, along with a tweak to include them in the new FloatingPoint protocol as well.  On the other hand, I would be happy to update the proposal, but could only reference the new FloatingPoint protocol, not the upcoming Integer protocol.<br></p><p><br>&gt; <br>&gt; Charles<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On May 3, 2016, at 10:57 PM, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The review of &quot;SE-0080: Failable Numeric Conversion Initializers&quot; begins now and runs through May 9.

Maybe the failable ones should be the default, and give the other ones a more descriptive 1st argument label.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That’s a good question.  It might be a good idea, but I wanted to keep this proposal small and non-breaking to maximize chances of acceptance.  I would support that change to the proposal if the core team was interested in going that direction.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; -Colin<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c53218a6524f4d644b6a75a4441ea631?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review] SE-0080: Failable Numeric Conversion Initializers</strong> from <string>Max Moiseev</string> &lt;moiseev at apple.com&gt;<p>May  5, 2016 at 03:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Hi all,<br></p><p>This email is the result of a discussion between members of the standard library team.<br></p><p>We suggest changing the initializers argument label to `exactly` to match the one used in the floating point protocols proposal &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0067-floating-point-protocols.md&gt;.
