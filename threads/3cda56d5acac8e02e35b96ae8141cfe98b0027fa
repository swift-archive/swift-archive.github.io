For instance, when passing a function reference instead of an inline closure, it might not be fully clear that it is, in fact, a function that is called _when_ completion/success/failure occurs. It might give an impression that, say, &quot;completion&quot; is a _thing_, a term of art describing something meaningful.<br></p><p>And so, presumably for this reason, the Cocoa convention is to use the word &quot;handler&quot;, like so:<br></p><p>    someAction(completionHandler: () -&gt; Void)<br></p><p>This isn&#39;t too bad, but it is slightly verbose in my opinion. Of course, clarity takes precedense over brevity, but I believe there&#39;s a good idiom, common in other languages/frameworks/environments, that&#39;s less verbose, conveys the semantics well if not better, and reads very nicely:<br></p><p>    someAction(onCompletion: () -&gt; Void)<br></p><p>At call site, this reads very naturally without any ambiguity both when passing a closure inline:<br></p><p>    someAction(onSuccess: { ... }, onFailure: { ... })<br></p><p>And when passing a function reference<br></p><p>    someAction(onCompletion: doSomethingElse)<br></p><p>I know this isn’t the topic for this thread which is why I wasn’t going to elaborate too much. Do you think this level of naming guidance is appropriate for the Guidelines? If not, then never mind, not a big deal — but if maybe, then I could start a new thread. (This also ties into SE-0005 since, as far as I can tell, the “completionHandler” pattern is used exclusively in Cocoa APIs. So if there was an agreement that “onSuccess” is a better convention, the APIs could easily be translated mechanically)<br></p><p>— Radek<br></p><p>&gt; On 26 Jan 2016, at 21:08, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; on Mon Jan 25 2016, Radosław Pietruszewski &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Paul, let’s start a new thread about this — I was going to write about<br>&gt;&gt; the same idiom, but it’s out of scope of this review.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I disagree with Dave that this is just a EDSL, <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I didn&#39;t say *just* an EDSL!
