Even when you&#39;re completely in<br>&gt; control, the fact that you still can&#39;t get this working is troubling. But<br>&gt; maybe I&#39;m just inflating extremely uncommon usecases.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; One more thing - consider two Swift packages each needing a different<br>&gt; version of OpenSSL. Does your proposal handle that case?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Anyway, I&#39;d love to read your proposal and then re-evaluate whether I<br>&gt; still feel like there&#39;s a large enough benefit in introducing such<br>&gt; customization to SwiftPM :)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Honza<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Mon, Mar 21, 2016 at 6:19 PM Max Howell &lt;max.howell at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; On Mar 19, 2016, at 10:55 AM, Honza Dvorsky via swift-build-dev &lt;<br>&gt;&gt; swift-build-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Hi All,<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; today I was trying to investigate how to build a proper cross-platform<br>&gt;&gt; server-side Swift project and only use SwiftPM to do it. In particular, I<br>&gt;&gt; was interested in getting OpenSSL/libcurl working as a dependency (built<br>&gt;&gt; from source). The main reason is that currently the big Swift server<br>&gt;&gt; frameworks all require manual steps during deployment (running apt-get/brew<br>&gt;&gt; to install libcurl/openssl/others) and I am trying to get rid of these<br>&gt;&gt; manual steps, eventually only requiring a `swift build` and run.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; With the great initial work<br>&gt;&gt; &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/183&gt; to support<br>&gt;&gt; building C-family packages in SwiftPM done by Ankit, I was able to have a<br>&gt;&gt; simple C package as a dependency, as advertised. However, the reality of<br>&gt;&gt; big cross-platform open source projects like OpenSSL and libcurl is that in<br>&gt;&gt; order to actually build it from source, a configure (or similar) script has<br>&gt;&gt; to be run to get the source code ready for compilation. And this is where I<br>&gt;&gt; got stuck.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Thus I wanted to kick off a discussion of what approach of solving this<br>&gt;&gt; problem with SwiftPM should be. The simple solution, which I&#39;m tentatively<br>&gt;&gt; proposing, is to have an optional &quot;post-clone&quot; script in the package&#39;s<br>&gt;&gt; repository. Then, the Package.swift would optionally contain a field for<br>&gt;&gt; the path to this script - and if present, it&#39;d get run after SwiftPM clones<br>&gt;&gt; this package. Note that this would be a &quot;post-clone&quot; script, not a<br>&gt;&gt; &quot;prebuild&quot; script - I imagine it&#39;d only run once when cloning and then only<br>&gt;&gt; after each clean.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; In order to get users to stop having to run manual script to install all<br>&gt;&gt; dependencies, I believe that we need to allow packages to declare what work<br>&gt;&gt; needs to be done on its source before compilation can begin.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I have a proposal I’d like to push today that adds knowledge to SwiftPM<br>&gt;&gt; about how to install system dependencies for System Module Packages.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; We are not keen to add arbitrary script execution to SwiftPM, because: 1)<br>&gt;&gt; Arbitrary scripts cannot be controlled and this leads to dependency hell<br>&gt;&gt; and 2) arbitrary scripts mean your package graph may do anything, which<br>&gt;&gt; nobody wants.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Now I’m fine with the “root package” ie. the package the user has control<br>&gt;&gt; over doing more, but this would be a different discussion.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; So the question becomes, is this sufficient? To have `brew install<br>&gt;&gt; openssl` run, or do you really need to install from source?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Max<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-build-dev mailing list<br>&gt; swift-build-dev at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-build-dev<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev/attachments/20160323/06956fe8/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
