As single line statements they offer no real saving over += 1 or -= 1, while requiring an additional operator covering all the various integer types. By forcing += 1 and -= 1 we also make sure that all assignment operations contain an equals sign, which I think is good for consistency.<br></p><p><br>For anyone that is desperately attached to using the operator then it’s not hard to add them back in, but I’ve used these for years and have no special fondness for them.<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/279fa63eae4ac804b4dbdb83686797bf?s=50"></div><header><strong>++ and --</strong> from <string>Austin Zheng</string> &lt;austinzheng at gmail.com&gt;<p>March 23, 2016 at 10:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>This pre-proposal needs to answer a few questions before it can really go<br>anywhere:<br></p><p>- What sort of mechanism can ++/-- exploit, that &quot;+= 1&quot; or &quot;-= 1&quot; can&#39;t, to<br>make the former perform better than the latter?
