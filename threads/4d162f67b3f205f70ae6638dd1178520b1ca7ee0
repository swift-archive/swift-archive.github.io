People coming to Swift from these other languages<br>may reasonably expect this operator to exist.  That said, there are also<br>popular languages which have kept the majority of C operators but dropped the<br>ternary operator (e.g. [Go](https://golang.org/doc/faq#Does_Go_have_a_ternary_form) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1362)).<br></p><p><br>Disadvantages of The Ternary Operator &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#disadvantages-of-the-ternary-operator&gt;<br></p><p>1. The existence of the ternary operator as a holdover from C is to increase<br>the familiarity of the Swift language for C family developers, at the expense<br>of newcomers.  Established developers do much better with learning concepts<br>than newcomers to programming and probably don&#39;t need their hands held<br>with this carry over of an operator.<br></p><p>2. The ternary operator adds complexity to the compiler, because it requires<br>special handling.  It is the only operator that requires two components to<br>work (both the `?` and the `:`), it uses a character that is excluded from<br>being used in other operators (`:`), and it isn&#39;t defined in the standard<br>library.<br></p><p>3. The ternary operator&#39;s usage of `?` can be confusing<br>to new users.  Every other instance of `?` is associated with<br>`Optional` values.<br></p><p>4. The ternary operator uses `:`, which is already a heavily overloaded<br>symbol in Swift.  `:` is used in hash tables, type annotations for variables,<br>class inheritance, and protocol conformance.<br></p><p>5. The ternary operator&#39;s short length lends it to being abused in the<br>nested ternary operator anti-pattern.  This is similar to the `++` and<br>`--` operators, which were removed in Swift 3.  While they worked fine and were<br>readable enough when used alone, using them multiple times in a single<br>expression like `function(a++, ++a)` made them highly unreadable and<br>confusing.<br></p><p>6. This operator is only applicable to a single type, `Bool`.<br></p><p>7. If the ternary operator weren&#39;t in common usage, it would not be proposed<br>for Swift.  Higher clarity can be achieved with common language features by<br>creating an extension to `Bool`.<br></p><p>8. The ternary operator was created for and is much more suited to a language<br>like C, where there were no generics and as such no alternative to an<br>unintuitive operator.<br></p><p>9. Several other modern languages, like Rust and Go discussed earlier, have<br>eschewed the usage of the ternary operator entirely.  Other languages that have<br>special constructs similar to `?:`, such as `if then else` in Haskell have<br>[discussed removing it](https://wiki.haskell.org/If-then-else#Is_If-Then-Else_so_important.3F).  `if then else` is identical to the `?:` operator,<br>excepting that it&#39;s prefixed by `if`, while `?:` has no prefix.<br></p><p> Example: `if True then 10 else 20`<br></p><p>10. On a more personal and anecdotal note, the ternary operator gave me more<br>trouble than any other operator when I was first learning how to program.<br>I’ve also spoken to several other people who expressed similar sentiments<br>about this operator’s inscrutability.<br></p><p>Proposed Approach &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#proposed-approach&gt;<br></p><p>We should drop the ternary operator in favor of a new extension to `Bool`.<br>There are a few possibilities for the naming of this function.

It&#39;s shorthand for (e.g.):<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt;&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt;&gt; let e: String<br>&gt;&gt; if a &lt; b {<br>&gt;&gt;   e = &quot;foo&quot;<br>&gt;&gt; } else {<br>&gt;&gt;   e = &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The second advantage of Swift supporting the ternary operator is continuity<br>&gt;&gt; with C, and other common languages in the extended C family (C++, Objective-C,<br>&gt;&gt; Java, C#, Javascript, etc).  People coming to Swift from these other languages<br>&gt;&gt; may reasonably expect this operator to exist.  That said, there are also<br>&gt;&gt; popular languages which have kept the majority of C operators but dropped the<br>&gt;&gt; ternary operator (e.g. [Go](https://golang.org/doc/faq#Does_Go_have_a_ternary_form &lt;https://golang.org/doc/faq#Does_Go_have_a_ternary_form&gt;) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1362 &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1362&gt;)).<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Disadvantages of The Ternary Operator &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#disadvantages-of-the-ternary-operator&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 1. The existence of the ternary operator as a holdover from C is to increase<br>&gt;&gt; the familiarity of the Swift language for C family developers, at the expense<br>&gt;&gt; of newcomers.  Established developers do much better with learning concepts<br>&gt;&gt; than newcomers to programming and probably don&#39;t need their hands held<br>&gt;&gt; with this carry over of an operator.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 2. The ternary operator adds complexity to the compiler, because it requires<br>&gt;&gt; special handling.  It is the only operator that requires two components to<br>&gt;&gt; work (both the `?` and the `:`), it uses a character that is excluded from<br>&gt;&gt; being used in other operators (`:`), and it isn&#39;t defined in the standard<br>&gt;&gt; library.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 3. The ternary operator&#39;s usage of `?` can be confusing<br>&gt;&gt; to new users.  Every other instance of `?` is associated with<br>&gt;&gt; `Optional` values.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 4. The ternary operator uses `:`, which is already a heavily overloaded<br>&gt;&gt; symbol in Swift.  `:` is used in hash tables, type annotations for variables,<br>&gt;&gt; class inheritance, and protocol conformance.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 5. The ternary operator&#39;s short length lends it to being abused in the<br>&gt;&gt; nested ternary operator anti-pattern.  This is similar to the `++` and<br>&gt;&gt; `--` operators, which were removed in Swift 3.  While they worked fine and were<br>&gt;&gt; readable enough when used alone, using them multiple times in a single<br>&gt;&gt; expression like `function(a++, ++a)` made them highly unreadable and<br>&gt;&gt; confusing.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 6. This operator is only applicable to a single type, `Bool`.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 7. If the ternary operator weren&#39;t in common usage, it would not be proposed<br>&gt;&gt; for Swift.  Higher clarity can be achieved with common language features by<br>&gt;&gt; creating an extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 8. The ternary operator was created for and is much more suited to a language<br>&gt;&gt; like C, where there were no generics and as such no alternative to an<br>&gt;&gt; unintuitive operator.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 9. Several other modern languages, like Rust and Go discussed earlier, have<br>&gt;&gt; eschewed the usage of the ternary operator entirely.  Other languages that have<br>&gt;&gt; special constructs similar to `?:`, such as `if then else` in Haskell have<br>&gt;&gt; [discussed removing it](https://wiki.haskell.org/If-then-else#Is_If-Then-Else_so_important.3F &lt;https://wiki.haskell.org/If-then-else#Is_If-Then-Else_so_important.3F&gt;).  `if then else` is identical to the `?:` operator,<br>&gt;&gt; excepting that it&#39;s prefixed by `if`, while `?:` has no prefix.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  Example: `if True then 10 else 20`<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 10. On a more personal and anecdotal note, the ternary operator gave me more<br>&gt;&gt; trouble than any other operator when I was first learning how to program.<br>&gt;&gt; I’ve also spoken to several other people who expressed similar sentiments<br>&gt;&gt; about this operator’s inscrutability.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Proposed Approach &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#proposed-approach&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; We should drop the ternary operator in favor of a new extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt;&gt; There are a few possibilities for the naming of this function.  We&#39;ve provided<br>&gt;&gt; four for consideration in this proposal, but are open to other options as well.<br>&gt;&gt; This proposal is much more about the concept than the naming of the replacement<br>&gt;&gt; function.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; extension Bool {<br>&gt;&gt;     /// If `self == true`, returns `t`, otherwise, returns `f`.<br>&gt;&gt;     func transformed&lt;T&gt;(true t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, false f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;&gt;         if self {<br>&gt;&gt;             return t()<br>&gt;&gt;         } else {<br>&gt;&gt;             return f()  <br>&gt;&gt;         }<br>&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;     func when&lt;T&gt;(true t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, false f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;&gt;       ...<br>&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;     func if&lt;T&gt;(true t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, false f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;&gt;       ...<br>&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;     func if&lt;T&gt;(then t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, else f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;&gt;       ...<br>&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Only one of these should be chosen.  We&#39;re not proposing adding multiple<br>&gt;&gt; functions that achieve the same thing.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Example usage:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt;&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt;&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).transformed(true: &quot;foo&quot;, false: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt;&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).when(true: &quot;foo&quot;, false: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt;&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).if(true: &quot;foo&quot;, false: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt;&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).if(then: &quot;foo&quot;, else: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Impact on existing code &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#impact-on-existing-code&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; This proposal is breaking and would require migration.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Alternatives considered &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#alternatives-considered&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Simplest alternative: we could leave the ternary operator as is and not<br>&gt;&gt; introduce any new concepts.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; It&#39;d also be possible to add an `if then else` Haskell-esque expression.<br>&gt;&gt; This would have the disadvantages of still needing special handling by the<br>&gt;&gt; compiler.  Since this proposal&#39;s intention is partially to remove compiler<br>&gt;&gt; complexity, this would be counterproductive and would probably confuse new<br>&gt;&gt; users in a similar way to how `?:` does.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20161026/0940792f/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/279fa63eae4ac804b4dbdb83686797bf?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Replace the ternary operator with an in-language function</strong> from <string>Austin Zheng</string> &lt;austinzheng at gmail.com&gt;<p>October 25, 2016 at 10:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Oct 25, 2016, at 10:13 PM, Charlotte Angela Tortorella &lt;charlotte.tortorella at icloud.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Addressing breaking source code: this is something that an auto migrator could extremely easily be written for.<br></p><p>Auto migrators are:<br>- Specific to Xcode, and therefore OS X Swift development using a very specific toolchain<br>- Less than reliable for large projects<br>- Not a replacement for the Swift 4 source stability goal.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; Addressing your first point, `?:` has the advantage of terseness.

This document is an attempt to provide a clear look at the ternary<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; operator without the baggage of the languages that came before, and comes<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the conclusion that we should deprecate and remove the ternary operator<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in favor of an extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As a quick refresher, here&#39;s what the ternary operator looks like:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // If a is less than b, sets e to &quot;foo&quot;, else sets e to &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; let e = a &lt; b ? &quot;foo&quot; : &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Advantages of The Ternary Operator &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#advantages-of-the-ternary-operator&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The primary advantage of this operator is its terseness and expressive<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; capability. It&#39;s shorthand for (e.g.):<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; let e: String<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if a &lt; b {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   e = &quot;foo&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; } else {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   e = &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The second advantage of Swift supporting the ternary operator is continuity<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with C, and other common languages in the extended C family (C++, Objective-C,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Java, C#, Javascript, etc).  People coming to Swift from these other languages<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may reasonably expect this operator to exist.  That said, there are also<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; popular languages which have kept the majority of C operators but dropped the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ternary operator (e.g. [Go](https://golang.org/doc/faq#Does_Go_have_a_ternary_form &lt;https://golang.org/doc/faq#Does_Go_have_a_ternary_form&gt;) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1362 &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1362&gt;)).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Disadvantages of The Ternary Operator &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#disadvantages-of-the-ternary-operator&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. The existence of the ternary operator as a holdover from C is to increase<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the familiarity of the Swift language for C family developers, at the expense<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of newcomers.  Established developers do much better with learning concepts<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than newcomers to programming and probably don&#39;t need their hands held<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with this carry over of an operator.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. The ternary operator adds complexity to the compiler, because it requires<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; special handling.  It is the only operator that requires two components to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work (both the `?` and the `:`), it uses a character that is excluded from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being used in other operators (`:`), and it isn&#39;t defined in the standard<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; library.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. The ternary operator&#39;s usage of `?` can be confusing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to new users.  Every other instance of `?` is associated with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `Optional` values.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. The ternary operator uses `:`, which is already a heavily overloaded<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; symbol in Swift.  `:` is used in hash tables, type annotations for variables,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class inheritance, and protocol conformance.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. The ternary operator&#39;s short length lends it to being abused in the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nested ternary operator anti-pattern.  This is similar to the `++` and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `--` operators, which were removed in Swift 3.  While they worked fine and were<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; readable enough when used alone, using them multiple times in a single<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expression like `function(a++, ++a)` made them highly unreadable and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6. This operator is only applicable to a single type, `Bool`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 7. If the ternary operator weren&#39;t in common usage, it would not be proposed<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for Swift.  Higher clarity can be achieved with common language features by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; creating an extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 8. The ternary operator was created for and is much more suited to a language<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like C, where there were no generics and as such no alternative to an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unintuitive operator.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 9. Several other modern languages, like Rust and Go discussed earlier, have<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eschewed the usage of the ternary operator entirely.  Other languages that have<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; special constructs similar to `?:`, such as `if then else` in Haskell have<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [discussed removing it](https://wiki.haskell.org/If-then-else#Is_If-Then-Else_so_important.3F &lt;https://wiki.haskell.org/If-then-else#Is_If-Then-Else_so_important.3F&gt;).  `if then else` is identical to the `?:` operator,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; excepting that it&#39;s prefixed by `if`, while `?:` has no prefix.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Example: `if True then 10 else 20`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 10.

This document is an attempt to provide a clear look at the ternary<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; operator without the baggage of the languages that came before, and comes<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the conclusion that we should deprecate and remove the ternary operator<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in favor of an extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As a quick refresher, here&#39;s what the ternary operator looks like:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; // If a is less than b, sets e to &quot;foo&quot;, else sets e to &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; let e = a &lt; b ? &quot;foo&quot; : &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Advantages of The Ternary Operator &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#advantages-of-the-ternary-operator&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The primary advantage of this operator is its terseness and expressive<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; capability. It&#39;s shorthand for (e.g.):<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; let e: String<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if a &lt; b {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   e = &quot;foo&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; } else {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   e = &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The second advantage of Swift supporting the ternary operator is continuity<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with C, and other common languages in the extended C family (C++, Objective-C,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Java, C#, Javascript, etc).  People coming to Swift from these other languages<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may reasonably expect this operator to exist.  That said, there are also<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; popular languages which have kept the majority of C operators but dropped the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ternary operator (e.g. [Go](https://golang.org/doc/faq#Does_Go_have_a_ternary_form &lt;https://golang.org/doc/faq#Does_Go_have_a_ternary_form&gt;) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1362 &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1362&gt;)).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Disadvantages of The Ternary Operator &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#disadvantages-of-the-ternary-operator&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. The existence of the ternary operator as a holdover from C is to increase<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the familiarity of the Swift language for C family developers, at the expense<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of newcomers.  Established developers do much better with learning concepts<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than newcomers to programming and probably don&#39;t need their hands held<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with this carry over of an operator.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. The ternary operator adds complexity to the compiler, because it requires<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; special handling.  It is the only operator that requires two components to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work (both the `?` and the `:`), it uses a character that is excluded from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being used in other operators (`:`), and it isn&#39;t defined in the standard<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; library.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. The ternary operator&#39;s usage of `?` can be confusing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to new users.  Every other instance of `?` is associated with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `Optional` values.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. The ternary operator uses `:`, which is already a heavily overloaded<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; symbol in Swift.  `:` is used in hash tables, type annotations for variables,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class inheritance, and protocol conformance.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. The ternary operator&#39;s short length lends it to being abused in the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nested ternary operator anti-pattern.  This is similar to the `++` and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `--` operators, which were removed in Swift 3.  While they worked fine and were<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; readable enough when used alone, using them multiple times in a single<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expression like `function(a++, ++a)` made them highly unreadable and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6. This operator is only applicable to a single type, `Bool`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 7. If the ternary operator weren&#39;t in common usage, it would not be proposed<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for Swift.  Higher clarity can be achieved with common language features by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; creating an extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 8. The ternary operator was created for and is much more suited to a language<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like C, where there were no generics and as such no alternative to an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unintuitive operator.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 9. Several other modern languages, like Rust and Go discussed earlier, have<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eschewed the usage of the ternary operator entirely.  Other languages that have<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; special constructs similar to `?:`, such as `if then else` in Haskell have<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [discussed removing it](https://wiki.haskell.org/If-then-else#Is_If-Then-Else_so_important.3F &lt;https://wiki.haskell.org/If-then-else#Is_If-Then-Else_so_important.3F&gt;).  `if then else` is identical to the `?:` operator,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; excepting that it&#39;s prefixed by `if`, while `?:` has no prefix.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Example: `if True then 10 else 20`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 10. On a more personal and anecdotal note, the ternary operator gave me more<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trouble than any other operator when I was first learning how to program.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I’ve also spoken to several other people who expressed similar sentiments<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about this operator’s inscrutability.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Proposed Approach &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#proposed-approach&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We should drop the ternary operator in favor of a new extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are a few possibilities for the naming of this function.  We&#39;ve provided<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; four for consideration in this proposal, but are open to other options as well.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This proposal is much more about the concept than the naming of the replacement<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; function.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extension Bool {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     /// If `self == true`, returns `t`, otherwise, returns `f`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func transformed&lt;T&gt;(true t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, false f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         if self {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;             return t()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         } else {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;             return f()  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func when&lt;T&gt;(true t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, false f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       ...<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func if&lt;T&gt;(true t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, false f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       ...<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func if&lt;T&gt;(then t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, else f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       ...<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Only one of these should be chosen.  We&#39;re not proposing adding multiple<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; functions that achieve the same thing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Example usage:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).transformed(true: &quot;foo&quot;, false: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).when(true: &quot;foo&quot;, false: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).if(true: &quot;foo&quot;, false: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).if(then: &quot;foo&quot;, else: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Impact on existing code &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#impact-on-existing-code&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This proposal is breaking and would require migration.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Alternatives considered &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#alternatives-considered&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Simplest alternative: we could leave the ternary operator as is and not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; introduce any new concepts.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;d also be possible to add an `if then else` Haskell-esque expression.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This would have the disadvantages of still needing special handling by the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compiler.  Since this proposal&#39;s intention is partially to remove compiler<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; complexity, this would be counterproductive and would probably confuse new<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; users in a similar way to how `?:` does.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt; <br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20161025/611dc5fb/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Replace the ternary operator with an in-language function</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>October 25, 2016 at 10:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Oct 25, 2016, at 10:30 PM, Charlotte Angela Tortorella via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  Not a replacement for the Swift 4 source stability goal.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Swift 4 doesn&#39;t actually have a source stability goal.

This document is an attempt to provide a clear look at the ternary<br>&gt; operator without the baggage of the languages that came before, and comes<br>&gt; to the conclusion that we should deprecate and remove the ternary operator<br>&gt; in favor of an extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; As a quick refresher, here&#39;s what the ternary operator looks like:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt; // If a is less than b, sets e to &quot;foo&quot;, else sets e to &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt; let e = a &lt; b ? &quot;foo&quot; : &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Advantages of The Ternary Operator<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The primary advantage of this operator is its terseness and expressive<br>&gt; capability. It&#39;s shorthand for (e.g.):<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt; let e: String<br>&gt; if a &lt; b {<br>&gt;   e = &quot;foo&quot;<br>&gt; } else {<br>&gt;   e = &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The second advantage of Swift supporting the ternary operator is continuity<br>&gt; with C, and other common languages in the extended C family (C++, Objective-C,<br>&gt; Java, C#, Javascript, etc).  People coming to Swift from these other languages<br>&gt; may reasonably expect this operator to exist.  That said, there are also<br>&gt; popular languages which have kept the majority of C operators but dropped the<br>&gt; ternary operator (e.g. [Go](https://golang.org/doc/faq#Does_Go_have_a_ternary_form) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1362)).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Disadvantages of The Ternary Operator<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1. The existence of the ternary operator as a holdover from C is to increase<br>&gt; the familiarity of the Swift language for C family developers, at the expense<br>&gt; of newcomers.  Established developers do much better with learning concepts<br>&gt; than newcomers to programming and probably don&#39;t need their hands held<br>&gt; with this carry over of an operator.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2. The ternary operator adds complexity to the compiler, because it requires<br>&gt; special handling.  It is the only operator that requires two components to<br>&gt; work (both the `?` and the `:`), it uses a character that is excluded from<br>&gt; being used in other operators (`:`), and it isn&#39;t defined in the standard<br>&gt; library.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 3. The ternary operator&#39;s usage of `?` can be confusing<br>&gt; to new users.  Every other instance of `?` is associated with<br>&gt; `Optional` values.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 4. The ternary operator uses `:`, which is already a heavily overloaded<br>&gt; symbol in Swift.  `:` is used in hash tables, type annotations for variables,<br>&gt; class inheritance, and protocol conformance.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 5. The ternary operator&#39;s short length lends it to being abused in the<br>&gt; nested ternary operator anti-pattern.  This is similar to the `++` and<br>&gt; `--` operators, which were removed in Swift 3.  While they worked fine and were<br>&gt; readable enough when used alone, using them multiple times in a single<br>&gt; expression like `function(a++, ++a)` made them highly unreadable and<br>&gt; confusing.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 6. This operator is only applicable to a single type, `Bool`.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 7. If the ternary operator weren&#39;t in common usage, it would not be proposed<br>&gt; for Swift.  Higher clarity can be achieved with common language features by<br>&gt; creating an extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 8. The ternary operator was created for and is much more suited to a language<br>&gt; like C, where there were no generics and as such no alternative to an<br>&gt; unintuitive operator.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 9. Several other modern languages, like Rust and Go discussed earlier, have<br>&gt; eschewed the usage of the ternary operator entirely.  Other languages that have<br>&gt; special constructs similar to `?:`, such as `if then else` in Haskell have<br>&gt; [discussed removing it](https://wiki.haskell.org/If-then-else#Is_If-Then-Else_so_important.3F).  `if then else` is identical to the `?:` operator,<br>&gt; excepting that it&#39;s prefixed by `if`, while `?:` has no prefix.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;  Example: `if True then 10 else 20`<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 10. On a more personal and anecdotal note, the ternary operator gave me more<br>&gt; trouble than any other operator when I was first learning how to program.<br>&gt; I’ve also spoken to several other people who expressed similar sentiments<br>&gt; about this operator’s inscrutability.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Proposed Approach<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We should drop the ternary operator in favor of a new extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt; There are a few possibilities for the naming of this function.  We&#39;ve provided<br>&gt; four for consideration in this proposal, but are open to other options as well.<br>&gt; This proposal is much more about the concept than the naming of the replacement<br>&gt; function.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; extension Bool {<br>&gt;     /// If `self == true`, returns `t`, otherwise, returns `f`.<br>&gt;     func transformed&lt;T&gt;(true t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, false f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;         if self {<br>&gt;             return t()<br>&gt;         } else {<br>&gt;             return f()  <br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     func when&lt;T&gt;(true t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, false f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;       ...<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     func if&lt;T&gt;(true t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, false f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;       ...<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     func if&lt;T&gt;(then t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, else f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;       ...<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Only one of these should be chosen.  We&#39;re not proposing adding multiple<br>&gt; functions that achieve the same thing.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Example usage:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).transformed(true: &quot;foo&quot;, false: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).when(true: &quot;foo&quot;, false: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).if(true: &quot;foo&quot;, false: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).if(then: &quot;foo&quot;, else: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Impact on existing code<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This proposal is breaking and would require migration.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Alternatives considered<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Simplest alternative: we could leave the ternary operator as is and not<br>&gt; introduce any new concepts.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It&#39;d also be possible to add an `if then else` Haskell-esque expression.<br>&gt; This would have the disadvantages of still needing special handling by the<br>&gt; compiler.  Since this proposal&#39;s intention is partially to remove compiler<br>&gt; complexity, this would be counterproductive and would probably confuse new<br>&gt; users in a similar way to how `?:` does.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20161026/7a05974a/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8aa3a9da9a32d3e98805b4a5409e4cee?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Replace the ternary operator with an in-language function</strong> from <string>Anton Zhilin</string> &lt;antonyzhilin at gmail.com&gt;<p>October 26, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>infix operator ♠️ : LogicalDisjunctionPrecedenceinfix operator ♥ :<br>LogicalDisjunctionPrecedence<br>func ♠️&lt;T&gt;(lhs: Bool, rhs: @autoclosure () throws -&gt; T) rethrows -&gt; T? {<br>    if lhs { return rhs() } else { return nil }<br>}func ♥&lt;T&gt;(lhs: T?, rhs: @autoclosure () throws -&gt; T) rethrows -&gt; T {<br>    return lhs ?? rhs<br>}<br>// Equivalent statements:<br>condition() ? first() : second()<br>condition() ♠️ first() ♥ second()<br></p><p>By removal of ?:, we could simplify our system of operators and prevent<br>some ternary-related bugs/unexpected stuff.

It&#39;s shorthand for (e.g.):<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt;&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt;&gt; let e: String<br>&gt;&gt; if a &lt; b {<br>&gt;&gt;   e = &quot;foo&quot;<br>&gt;&gt; } else {<br>&gt;&gt;   e = &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The second advantage of Swift supporting the ternary operator is<br>&gt;&gt; continuity<br>&gt;&gt; with C, and other common languages in the extended C family (C++,<br>&gt;&gt; Objective-C,<br>&gt;&gt; Java, C#, Javascript, etc).  People coming to Swift from these other<br>&gt;&gt; languages<br>&gt;&gt; may reasonably expect this operator to exist.  That said, there are also<br>&gt;&gt; popular languages which have kept the majority of C operators but dropped<br>&gt;&gt; the<br>&gt;&gt; ternary operator (e.g. [Go](https://golang.org/doc/fa<br>&gt;&gt; q#Does_Go_have_a_ternary_form) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust<br>&gt;&gt; -lang/rfcs/issues/1362)).<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Disadvantages of The Ternary Operator<br>&gt;&gt; &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#disadvantages-of-the-ternary-operator&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 1. The existence of the ternary operator as a holdover from C is to<br>&gt;&gt; increase<br>&gt;&gt; the familiarity of the Swift language for C family developers, at the<br>&gt;&gt; expense<br>&gt;&gt; of newcomers.  Established developers do much better with learning<br>&gt;&gt; concepts<br>&gt;&gt; than newcomers to programming and probably don&#39;t need their hands held<br>&gt;&gt; with this carry over of an operator.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 2. The ternary operator adds complexity to the compiler, because it<br>&gt;&gt; requires<br>&gt;&gt; special handling.  It is the only operator that requires two components to<br>&gt;&gt; work (both the `?` and the `:`), it uses a character that is excluded from<br>&gt;&gt; being used in other operators (`:`), and it isn&#39;t defined in the standard<br>&gt;&gt; library.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 3. The ternary operator&#39;s usage of `?` can be confusing<br>&gt;&gt; to new users.  Every other instance of `?` is associated with<br>&gt;&gt; `Optional` values.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 4. The ternary operator uses `:`, which is already a heavily overloaded<br>&gt;&gt; symbol in Swift.  `:` is used in hash tables, type annotations for<br>&gt;&gt; variables,<br>&gt;&gt; class inheritance, and protocol conformance.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 5. The ternary operator&#39;s short length lends it to being abused in the<br>&gt;&gt; nested ternary operator anti-pattern.  This is similar to the `++` and<br>&gt;&gt; `--` operators, which were removed in Swift 3.  While they worked fine<br>&gt;&gt; and were<br>&gt;&gt; readable enough when used alone, using them multiple times in a single<br>&gt;&gt; expression like `function(a++, ++a)` made them highly unreadable and<br>&gt;&gt; confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 6.

It&#39;s shorthand for (e.g.):<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; let e: String<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; if a &lt; b {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   e = &quot;foo&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; } else {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   e = &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The second advantage of Swift supporting the ternary operator is continuity<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; with C, and other common languages in the extended C family (C++, Objective-C,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Java, C#, Javascript, etc).  People coming to Swift from these other languages<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; may reasonably expect this operator to exist.  That said, there are also<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; popular languages which have kept the majority of C operators but dropped the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ternary operator (e.g. [Go](https://golang.org/doc/faq#Does_Go_have_a_ternary_form) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1362)).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Disadvantages of The Ternary Operator<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. The existence of the ternary operator as a holdover from C is to increase<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; the familiarity of the Swift language for C family developers, at the expense<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; of newcomers.  Established developers do much better with learning concepts<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; than newcomers to programming and probably don&#39;t need their hands held<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; with this carry over of an operator.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. The ternary operator adds complexity to the compiler, because it requires<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; special handling.  It is the only operator that requires two components to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; work (both the `?` and the `:`), it uses a character that is excluded from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; being used in other operators (`:`), and it isn&#39;t defined in the standard<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; library.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. The ternary operator&#39;s usage of `?` can be confusing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; to new users.  Every other instance of `?` is associated with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; `Optional` values.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. The ternary operator uses `:`, which is already a heavily overloaded<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; symbol in Swift.  `:` is used in hash tables, type annotations for variables,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; class inheritance, and protocol conformance.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. The ternary operator&#39;s short length lends it to being abused in the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; nested ternary operator anti-pattern.  This is similar to the `++` and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; `--` operators, which were removed in Swift 3.  While they worked fine and were<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; readable enough when used alone, using them multiple times in a single<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; expression like `function(a++, ++a)` made them highly unreadable and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; confusing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 6. This operator is only applicable to a single type, `Bool`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 7. If the ternary operator weren&#39;t in common usage, it would not be proposed<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; for Swift.  Higher clarity can be achieved with common language features by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; creating an extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 8. The ternary operator was created for and is much more suited to a language<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; like C, where there were no generics and as such no alternative to an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; unintuitive operator.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 9. Several other modern languages, like Rust and Go discussed earlier, have<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; eschewed the usage of the ternary operator entirely.  Other languages that have<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; special constructs similar to `?:`, such as `if then else` in Haskell have<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; [discussed removing it](https://wiki.haskell.org/If-then-else#Is_If-Then-Else_so_important.3F).  `if then else` is identical to the `?:` operator,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; excepting that it&#39;s prefixed by `if`, while `?:` has no prefix.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Example: `if True then 10 else 20`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 10. On a more personal and anecdotal note, the ternary operator gave me more<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; trouble than any other operator when I was first learning how to program.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I’ve also spoken to several other people who expressed similar sentiments<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; about this operator’s inscrutability.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Proposed Approach<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; We should drop the ternary operator in favor of a new extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; There are a few possibilities for the naming of this function.  We&#39;ve provided<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; four for consideration in this proposal, but are open to other options as well.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This proposal is much more about the concept than the naming of the replacement<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; function.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; extension Bool {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     /// If `self == true`, returns `t`, otherwise, returns `f`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     func transformed&lt;T&gt;(true t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, false f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         if self {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;             return t()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         } else {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;             return f()  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     func when&lt;T&gt;(true t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, false f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;       ...<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     func if&lt;T&gt;(true t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, false f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;       ...<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     func if&lt;T&gt;(then t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, else f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;       ...<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Only one of these should be chosen.  We&#39;re not proposing adding multiple<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; functions that achieve the same thing.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Example usage:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).transformed(true: &quot;foo&quot;, false: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).when(true: &quot;foo&quot;, false: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).if(true: &quot;foo&quot;, false: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).if(then: &quot;foo&quot;, else: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Impact on existing code<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This proposal is breaking and would require migration.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Alternatives considered<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Simplest alternative: we could leave the ternary operator as is and not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; introduce any new concepts.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;d also be possible to add an `if then else` Haskell-esque expression.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This would have the disadvantages of still needing special handling by the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; compiler.  Since this proposal&#39;s intention is partially to remove compiler<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; complexity, this would be counterproductive and would probably confuse new<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; users in a similar way to how `?:` does.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20161026/1837643f/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/84905ff33b4990cd337eeef291d91ff0?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] Replace the ternary operator with an in-language function</strong> from <string>Soroush Khanlou</string> &lt;soroushkhanlou at gmail.com&gt;<p>October 26, 2016 at 11:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>+1 from me as well.<br></p><p>I was initially unconvinced, until Charlotte showed me her proposal.

The syntax z ? x : y is  not hard to comprehend and expresses powerful statements in just a simple line. I do agree it is abused. It is used in places that a fuller if statement would help make sense of the code. It is on the developer to help make the operator easier to understand.

This document is an attempt to provide a clear look at the ternary<br>&gt; operator without the baggage of the languages that came before, and comes<br>&gt; to the conclusion that we should deprecate and remove the ternary operator<br>&gt; in favor of an extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As a quick refresher, here&#39;s what the ternary operator looks like:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt; // If a is less than b, sets e to &quot;foo&quot;, else sets e to &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt; let e = a &lt; b ? &quot;foo&quot; : &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Advantages of The Ternary Operator<br>&gt; &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#advantages-of-the-ternary-operator&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The primary advantage of this operator is its terseness and expressive<br>&gt; capability. It&#39;s shorthand for (e.g.):<br>&gt;<br>&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt; let e: String<br>&gt; if a &lt; b {<br>&gt;   e = &quot;foo&quot;<br>&gt; } else {<br>&gt;   e = &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The second advantage of Swift supporting the ternary operator is continuity<br>&gt; with C, and other common languages in the extended C family (C++,<br>&gt; Objective-C,<br>&gt; Java, C#, Javascript, etc).  People coming to Swift from these other<br>&gt; languages<br>&gt; may reasonably expect this operator to exist.  That said, there are also<br>&gt; popular languages which have kept the majority of C operators but dropped<br>&gt; the<br>&gt; ternary operator (e.g. [Go](<br>&gt; https://golang.org/doc/faq#Does_Go_have_a_ternary_form) and [Rust](<br>&gt; https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1362)).<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Disadvantages of The Ternary Operator<br>&gt; &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#disadvantages-of-the-ternary-operator&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 1. The existence of the ternary operator as a holdover from C is to<br>&gt; increase<br>&gt; the familiarity of the Swift language for C family developers, at the<br>&gt; expense<br>&gt; of newcomers.  Established developers do much better with learning concepts<br>&gt; than newcomers to programming and probably don&#39;t need their hands held<br>&gt; with this carry over of an operator.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 2. The ternary operator adds complexity to the compiler, because it<br>&gt; requires<br>&gt; special handling.  It is the only operator that requires two components to<br>&gt; work (both the `?` and the `:`), it uses a character that is excluded from<br>&gt; being used in other operators (`:`), and it isn&#39;t defined in the standard<br>&gt; library.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 3. The ternary operator&#39;s usage of `?` can be confusing<br>&gt; to new users.  Every other instance of `?` is associated with<br>&gt; `Optional` values.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 4. The ternary operator uses `:`, which is already a heavily overloaded<br>&gt; symbol in Swift.  `:` is used in hash tables, type annotations for<br>&gt; variables,<br>&gt; class inheritance, and protocol conformance.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 5. The ternary operator&#39;s short length lends it to being abused in the<br>&gt; nested ternary operator anti-pattern.  This is similar to the `++` and<br>&gt; `--` operators, which were removed in Swift 3.  While they worked fine and<br>&gt; were<br>&gt; readable enough when used alone, using them multiple times in a single<br>&gt; expression like `function(a++, ++a)` made them highly unreadable and<br>&gt; confusing.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 6. This operator is only applicable to a single type, `Bool`.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 7. If the ternary operator weren&#39;t in common usage, it would not be<br>&gt; proposed<br>&gt; for Swift.  Higher clarity can be achieved with common language features by<br>&gt; creating an extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 8. The ternary operator was created for and is much more suited to a<br>&gt; language<br>&gt; like C, where there were no generics and as such no alternative to an<br>&gt; unintuitive operator.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 9. Several other modern languages, like Rust and Go discussed earlier, have<br>&gt; eschewed the usage of the ternary operator entirely.  Other languages that<br>&gt; have<br>&gt; special constructs similar to `?:`, such as `if then else` in Haskell have<br>&gt; [discussed removing it](<br>&gt; https://wiki.haskell.org/If-then-else#Is_If-Then-Else_so_important.3F).<br>&gt;  `if then else` is identical to the `?:` operator,<br>&gt; excepting that it&#39;s prefixed by `if`, while `?:` has no prefix.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;  Example: `if True then 10 else 20`<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 10. On a more personal and anecdotal note, the ternary operator gave me<br>&gt; more<br>&gt; trouble than any other operator when I was first learning how to program.<br>&gt; I’ve also spoken to several other people who expressed similar sentiments<br>&gt; about this operator’s inscrutability.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Proposed Approach<br>&gt; &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#proposed-approach&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; We should drop the ternary operator in favor of a new extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt; There are a few possibilities for the naming of this function.

Familiar constructs make Swift easier for programmers (its target audience) easier to learn.<br></p><p>Point by point:<br></p><p><br>  1.  Being a holdover from C isn’t a bad thing. We can take things that were useful in C and make them part of Swift. Who said C language elements were a non-goal of Swift. And to the “ternary operator is hard to learn” point. This point gets made over and over in proposals to change Swift, ease of learning is like performance and security – you can never have enough so there is no counter-argument. If you can’t learn the ternary operator, Swift isn’t the language for you, because what are you going to do when you get to generics and higher order functions.<br>  2.  If the ternary operator adds complexity to the compiler then it really isn’t a holdover from C. We have quite a long time to know how to parse it from our C legacy.<br>  3.  See #1, new users are always confused about everything. They don’t stay that way. The language doesn’t need to be tuned to support it’s non-users. Most developers understand the ternary operator, and it is useful to them. Who is this language for?<br>  4.  The “:” appears in other places in the grammar. So what. So do parenthesis and brackets. It is just a token used in a grammar rule as a separator, it doesn’t have a meaning on its own, and it shouldn’t have one that isn’t its function.<br>  5.  So your argument is to make the ternary expression longer to discourage nesting. This is much different than the argument for function(a++, ++a) where order of function parameter evaluation influenced the code, but was not expressed by it.

And if<br>it wasn’t already there, I do think that it would be something we should<br>add (same for ??).<br>​<br></p><p>On Thu, 27 Oct 2016 at 01:44 David Sweeris via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;<br>&gt; On Oct 25, 2016, at 23:51, Charlotte Angela Tortorella via swift-evolution<br>&gt; &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Disadvantages of The Ternary Operator<br>&gt; &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#disadvantages-of-the-ternary-operator&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; [...]<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 6.

This document is an attempt to provide a clear look at the ternary<br>&gt; operator without the baggage of the languages that came before, and comes<br>&gt; to the conclusion that we should deprecate and remove the ternary operator<br>&gt; in favor of an extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; As a quick refresher, here&#39;s what the ternary operator looks like:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt; // If a is less than b, sets e to &quot;foo&quot;, else sets e to &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt; let e = a &lt; b ? &quot;foo&quot; : &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Advantages of The Ternary Operator &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#advantages-of-the-ternary-operator&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The primary advantage of this operator is its terseness and expressive<br>&gt; capability. It&#39;s shorthand for (e.g.):<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt; let e: String<br>&gt; if a &lt; b {<br>&gt;   e = &quot;foo&quot;<br>&gt; } else {<br>&gt;   e = &quot;bar&quot;<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The second advantage of Swift supporting the ternary operator is continuity<br>&gt; with C, and other common languages in the extended C family (C++, Objective-C,<br>&gt; Java, C#, Javascript, etc).  People coming to Swift from these other languages<br>&gt; may reasonably expect this operator to exist.  That said, there are also<br>&gt; popular languages which have kept the majority of C operators but dropped the<br>&gt; ternary operator (e.g. [Go](https://golang.org/doc/faq#Does_Go_have_a_ternary_form &lt;https://golang.org/doc/faq#Does_Go_have_a_ternary_form&gt;) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1362 &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1362&gt;)).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Disadvantages of The Ternary Operator &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#disadvantages-of-the-ternary-operator&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1. The existence of the ternary operator as a holdover from C is to increase<br>&gt; the familiarity of the Swift language for C family developers, at the expense<br>&gt; of newcomers.  Established developers do much better with learning concepts<br>&gt; than newcomers to programming and probably don&#39;t need their hands held<br>&gt; with this carry over of an operator.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2. The ternary operator adds complexity to the compiler, because it requires<br>&gt; special handling.  It is the only operator that requires two components to<br>&gt; work (both the `?` and the `:`), it uses a character that is excluded from<br>&gt; being used in other operators (`:`), and it isn&#39;t defined in the standard<br>&gt; library.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 3. The ternary operator&#39;s usage of `?` can be confusing<br>&gt; to new users.  Every other instance of `?` is associated with<br>&gt; `Optional` values.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 4. The ternary operator uses `:`, which is already a heavily overloaded<br>&gt; symbol in Swift.  `:` is used in hash tables, type annotations for variables,<br>&gt; class inheritance, and protocol conformance.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 5. The ternary operator&#39;s short length lends it to being abused in the<br>&gt; nested ternary operator anti-pattern.  This is similar to the `++` and<br>&gt; `--` operators, which were removed in Swift 3.  While they worked fine and were<br>&gt; readable enough when used alone, using them multiple times in a single<br>&gt; expression like `function(a++, ++a)` made them highly unreadable and<br>&gt; confusing.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 6. This operator is only applicable to a single type, `Bool`.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 7. If the ternary operator weren&#39;t in common usage, it would not be proposed<br>&gt; for Swift.  Higher clarity can be achieved with common language features by<br>&gt; creating an extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 8. The ternary operator was created for and is much more suited to a language<br>&gt; like C, where there were no generics and as such no alternative to an<br>&gt; unintuitive operator.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 9. Several other modern languages, like Rust and Go discussed earlier, have<br>&gt; eschewed the usage of the ternary operator entirely.  Other languages that have<br>&gt; special constructs similar to `?:`, such as `if then else` in Haskell have<br>&gt; [discussed removing it](https://wiki.haskell.org/If-then-else#Is_If-Then-Else_so_important.3F &lt;https://wiki.haskell.org/If-then-else#Is_If-Then-Else_so_important.3F&gt;).  `if then else` is identical to the `?:` operator,<br>&gt; excepting that it&#39;s prefixed by `if`, while `?:` has no prefix.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;  Example: `if True then 10 else 20`<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 10. On a more personal and anecdotal note, the ternary operator gave me more<br>&gt; trouble than any other operator when I was first learning how to program.<br>&gt; I’ve also spoken to several other people who expressed similar sentiments<br>&gt; about this operator’s inscrutability.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Proposed Approach &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#proposed-approach&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We should drop the ternary operator in favor of a new extension to `Bool`.<br>&gt; There are a few possibilities for the naming of this function.  We&#39;ve provided<br>&gt; four for consideration in this proposal, but are open to other options as well.<br>&gt; This proposal is much more about the concept than the naming of the replacement<br>&gt; function.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; extension Bool {<br>&gt;     /// If `self == true`, returns `t`, otherwise, returns `f`.<br>&gt;     func transformed&lt;T&gt;(true t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, false f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;         if self {<br>&gt;             return t()<br>&gt;         } else {<br>&gt;             return f()  <br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     func when&lt;T&gt;(true t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, false f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;       ...<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     func if&lt;T&gt;(true t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, false f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;       ...<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     func if&lt;T&gt;(then t: @autoclosure () -&gt; T, else f: @autoclosure () -&gt; T) -&gt; T {<br>&gt;       ...<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Only one of these should be chosen.  We&#39;re not proposing adding multiple<br>&gt; functions that achieve the same thing.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Example usage:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let a = 10<br>&gt; let b = 20<br>&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).transformed(true: &quot;foo&quot;, false: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).when(true: &quot;foo&quot;, false: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).if(true: &quot;foo&quot;, false: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt; _ = (a &lt; b).if(then: &quot;foo&quot;, else: &quot;bar&quot;)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Impact on existing code &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#impact-on-existing-code&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This proposal is breaking and would require migration.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Alternatives considered &lt;https://gist.github.com/Qata/25a11c21200f1cf8f43ed78e9ffd727c#alternatives-considered&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Simplest alternative: we could leave the ternary operator as is and not<br>&gt; introduce any new concepts.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It&#39;d also be possible to add an `if then else` Haskell-esque expression.<br>&gt; This would have the disadvantages of still needing special handling by the<br>&gt; compiler.  Since this proposal&#39;s intention is partially to remove compiler<br>&gt; complexity, this would be counterproductive and would probably confuse new<br>&gt; users in a similar way to how `?:` does.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20161027/0a86176c/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
