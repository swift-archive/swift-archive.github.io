The proposal has been *rejected*:<br></p><p>The community feedback on this proposal was that the most important thing was for the syntax to align with that of the forthcoming property behavior syntax.  The core team does not know what that syntax will be, so it prefers to reject this proposal.  While it would be great to align “lazy” with behavior syntax, but the cost of it diverging is very low (it is easy and not harmful to accept this as a legacy syntax for a long time if the preferred syntax changes in the future), and it would be worse to switch “lazy” to “@lazy” in Swift 3, only to switch it to something else in a subsequent release.<br></p><p>Thank you to Anton3 for driving this discussion forward!  <br></p><p>-Chris Lattner<br>Review Manager<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
