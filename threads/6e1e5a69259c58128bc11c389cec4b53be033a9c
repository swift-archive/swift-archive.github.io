It is only an exceptional case where we don’t. Why don’t we take advantage of Swift’s default parameters to let this be<br></p><p>dismiss()<br></p><p>Similarly, UIButtons in UIKit stand out from UILabel’s and other widgets when we get and set titles/text. In the pair title(forState:), set(title:, forState:), we we took advantage of the default value .Normal for state then we’d have calls like this<br></p><p>button.title()<br>button.setTitle(“Hello”)<br></p><p>and only call out the state in cases where we were setting the title for a non-Normal state.<br></p><p>Erica raises the general question that results: there are many defaults like this that would make Swift code read more naturally when working with non-exceptional cases and would call out when we are working with exceptional cases.<br></p><p> Is there a proper way in which to request such an audit/changes? I understand that that may be a Foundation/Cocoa Evolution issue and not a Swift evolution issue.<br></p><p>It does break code - but so does changing dismissViewControllerAnimated to dismissAnimated - it seems that paying the price once would be desirable.<br></p><p>Best,<br></p><p>Daniel<br></p><p><br>&gt; On Apr 8, 2016, at 1:40 PM, Erica Sadun &lt;erica at ericasadun.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Is there a best way to request default values for common Cocoa and Cocoa Touch APIs? <br>&gt; Now that we&#39;re moving to Swift, the language supports defaults and omitted parameters<br>&gt; but the ObjC APIs do not (yet) supply them. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; For example, dismissViewControllerAnimated(flag: true, completion: nil) <br>&gt; could become dismissAnimated() when default values are available for flag and completion.<br>&gt; There&#39;s a large-ish class of these boilerplate defaults and it would be nice if there were a way to<br>&gt; be able to request them.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; cc&#39;ing in Daniel S whose idea this is.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks, -- E<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160410/fa830e50/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/89e9af7c5754673419c8fac930319700?s=50"></div><header><strong>Requesting default values for Cocoa/Cocoa Touch APIs</strong> from <string>Russ Bishop</string> &lt;xenadu at gmail.com&gt;<p>April 11, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Wouldn’t this be the responsibility of UIKit/AppKit teams to provide extensions that pass the default values?<br></p><p>Russ<br></p><p>&gt; On Apr 8, 2016, at 10:40 AM, Erica Sadun via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Is there a best way to request default values for common Cocoa and Cocoa Touch APIs? <br>&gt; Now that we&#39;re moving to Swift, the language supports defaults and omitted parameters<br>&gt; but the ObjC APIs do not (yet) supply them. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; For example, dismissViewControllerAnimated(flag: true, completion: nil) <br>&gt; could become dismissAnimated() when default values are available for flag and completion.<br>&gt; There&#39;s a large-ish class of these boilerplate defaults and it would be nice if there were a way to<br>&gt; be able to request them.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; cc&#39;ing in Daniel S whose idea this is.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks, -- E<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160411/2a34eb7d/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
