There might be better ways to do that, but that is what immediately came to mind.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Wed, Dec 16, 2015 at 2:43 PM Terrence Katzenbaer via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because APIs are designed to be generic, protocols that must be conformed generally use types like Object or other base classes for a given framework. This introduces type casting verbosity when implementing the protocol for a specific use. I would like to see the ability to strengthen argument types in functions declared for protocol conformance.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; An example:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo { }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bar: Foo { }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; protocol FooDelegate {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func didPerformSomeAction(object: Foo)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class FooController: FooDelegate {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func didPerformSomeAction(var object: Foo) {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         // I know that object must be a Bar instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         object = object as! Bar<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         // do something with object<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class ProposedFooController: FooDelegate { // Type &#39;ProposedFooController&#39; does not conform to protocol &#39;FooDelegate&#39;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     func didPerformSomeAction(object: Bar) {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         // do something with Bar instance<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The glaring issue I see outright is how the runtime should fail when `didPerformSomeAction` in `ProposedFooController` is called with a non-Bar instance... But perhaps it /should/ fail outright because the programmer has explicitly stated that the type should be Bar.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151216/fbd1355e/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
