That&#39;s not a problem when the code doesn&#39;t <br>have any external side-effects, but it&#39;s a deal killer here: repeatedly <br>sending a `make` command will spawn multiple extra TextEdit documents; <br>repeatedly sending a `delete` command could wipe too many files in <br>Finder, and so on. Switching the playground to manual execution doesn&#39;t <br>really help either, since the point of a step-by-step tutorial is to <br>enter one line at a time and see what it does before moving on to the <br>next step. So Playgrounds are a non-starter for this kind of use - <br>unless I&#39;ve missed something?<br></p><p><br>Luckily, Swift also provides an old-school interactive REPL at <br>`/usr/bin/swift`, which allows Swift code to be entered and executed in <br>traditional single-line mode, while also preserving any variable <br>assignments for reuse in later lines. Thus the user can safely `make` a <br>new TextEdit document on line 1, modify its contents on line 2, and save <br>and close it on line 3, and TextEdit will perform each of these steps <br>immediately and only once. However, I can&#39;t figure out how to make the <br>`swift ...` command do the following:<br></p><p>1. Import the `SwiftAutomation.framework` from my Xcode project (since <br>Swift 3 still doesn&#39;t allow us to build standalone frameworks for <br>installing into `~/Library`).<br></p><p>2. Read and compile additional Swift source files (`TextEditGlue.swift`, <br>`FinderGlue.swift`, etc) from my Xcode project, so that those files&#39; <br>classes are also available for use when the REPL starts.<br></p><p>Can the `swift` command do both these things (I don&#39;t mind if it takes a <br>couple seconds to launch while it compiles the glue files), and if it <br>can what is the magical incantation for doing so?<br></p><p><br>Many thanks,<br></p><p>has<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
