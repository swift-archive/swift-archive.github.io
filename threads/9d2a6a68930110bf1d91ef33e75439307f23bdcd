We already have that problem in the lazy flatMap collection.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I don’t have any negative feedback that isn’t subsumed by the next section.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; # Concern: Linearity Baked-In<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Even with this change, I have some concern that the proposed<br>&gt;&gt; protocol hierarchy from `Collection` onward feels like it has a<br>&gt;&gt; foreseeable lack of generality due to how strongly &quot;linear&quot; the<br>&gt;&gt; design wants `Collection` to be.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Is this the right time to raise such concerns (e.g. in-scope for this discussion)?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; We can definitely dive into more details about this.  One thing that I<br>&gt; would want to understand is whether this non-linearity concept could<br>&gt; be added later without a re-design.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Could you provide more information about the linearity issues that you<br>&gt; have in mind?  Are you thinking of something like Segmented Iterators<br>&gt; and Hierarchical Algorithms [1]?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; [1] http://lafstern.org/matt/segmented.pdf<br></p><p>Awesome paper; everybody should read it ;-)<br></p><p>Collections aren&#39;t necessarily about fundamentally linear structures,<br>but about *linearizable* structures.  If you want to build a system of<br>generic algorithms that work efficiently on all kinds of data<br>structures, flat linearity won&#39;t always be the most efficient<br>abstraction, but:<br></p><p>1. It&#39;s generally simpler to write linear algorithms (e.g. even copying<br>   from one hierarchical data structure to another with different<br>   intermediate segment boundaries can be hard to code).<br></p><p>2. You&#39;ll want the linear specialization for the leaves of your data<br>   structure regardless of what else you do, so having a linearized<br>   abstraction is important even if you&#39;re going to build a hierarchical<br>   one.<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
