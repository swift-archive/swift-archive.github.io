If I were doing a project like this I’d start with a microkernel like FreeRTOS or the guts of MINIX3, which provide the above and a bit more.<br></p><p>—Jens<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20151220/ed048dc7/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed6cb17c056398e79b4360376ffa916e?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-dev] Cross Compiling Swift for Bare Metal?</strong> from <string>William Dillon</string> &lt;wdillon at coas.oregonstate.edu&gt;<p>December 20, 2015 at 03:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Though it might sound a little silly (because why not run linux), but starting with a beagle bone black would not be a terrible way to begin with bare metal work.
