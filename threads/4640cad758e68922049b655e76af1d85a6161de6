I&#39;m not sure how good or portable its backend support is though. You might look at FloatingPoint.swift.gyb and see what breaks if you extend it to generate a Quad type backed by Builtin.FPIEEE128.<br></p><p>-Joe<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151208/330f06ab/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
