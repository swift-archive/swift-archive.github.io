Here’s the SHA-1 hash on my end:<br></p><p>68e2ba878d2c9803bbfda760b24b399e8ada4f79<br>swift-2.2-SNAPSHOT-2015-12-22-a-osx.pkg<br></p><p>But, it is not downloaded from the App store.  Check your &quot;System<br>preferences&quot; &gt; &quot;Security and privacy&quot; &gt; &quot;General&quot; page.  If you have<br>it set to &quot;Mac App store only&quot; then it would explain what you are<br>seeing.<br></p><p>&gt; I’ve installed it anyway. I’m not carrying any state secrets, I hope?<br></p><p>Well, code signing is meant to allow you to ensure that the toolchain<br>that you are installing was indeed built by the Swift Open Source<br>project (and not, say, some attacker who is planting a<br>man-in-the-middle attack while you are downloading it).<br></p><p>To double-check, you can use the SHA-1 hash I pasted above.<br></p><p>Dmitri<br></p><p>-- <br>main(i,j){for(i=2;;i++){for(j=2;j&lt;i;j++){if(!(i%j)){j=0;break;}}if<br>(j){printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,i);}}} /*Dmitri Gribenko &lt;gribozavr at gmail.com&gt;*/<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
