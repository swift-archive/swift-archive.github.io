Last time I tried something like this it failed because .enumerated() only returns numeric offsets, but the index type of a collection may not necessary be compatible (not all indices are just a plain numeric value, consider a type that returns AnyIndex). So this will only work when your indices are integers starting from zero.<br></p><p>I think the following should work for the generic case, and is pretty similar:<br></p><p>extension MutableCollection {<br>	public mutating func remove(indices: Set&lt;Index&gt;) {<br>		var index = self.startIndex<br>		self = self.filter {<br>			let result = indices.contains(index)<br>			self.formIndex(after: &amp;index)<br>			return result<br>		}<br>	}<br>}<br></p><p>(note: I&#39;m not in a position to test this just now so it may not work exactly as written, but that’s the gist of how to do it safely I think)<br></p><p>The main question I have is how do you get into a situation where you’ve generated the indices, but could not put the same code into a call to .filter? For example:<br></p><p>	var indicesToRemove:Set&lt;Index&gt; = []<br>	for eachIndex in myArray.indices {<br>		if someCondition(myArray[eachIndex]) { indicesToRemove.insert(eachIndex) }<br>	}<br>	myArray.remove(indices: indicesToRemove)<br></p><p>Could be rewritten as:<br></p><p>	myArray = myArray.filter { someCondition($0) }<br></p><p>If what we want is in-place removal then I think what we need is some kind of MutatingIteratorProtocol which includes a .remove() method; this method would remove the last element retrieved without invalidating the iterator or skipping an element, allowing us to do the following:<br></p><p>	var iterator = myArray.makeIterator() // Conforms to MutatingIteratorProtocol<br>	while let eachElement = iterator.next() {<br>		if someCondition(eachElement) { iterator.remove() }<br>	}<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160619/56d817c1/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d4fb9162c777a5d6d0b1fb00893d709?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Pitch] remove(at: Set&lt;Index&gt;)</strong> from <string>Haravikk</string> &lt;swift-evolution at haravikk.me&gt;<p>June 19, 2016 at 08:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On 19 Jun 2016, at 11:12, Haravikk via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I think the following should work for the generic case, and is pretty similar:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; extension MutableCollection {<br>&gt; 	public mutating func remove(indices: Set&lt;Index&gt;) {<br>&gt; 		var index = self.startIndex<br>&gt; 		self = self.filter {<br>&gt; 			let result = indices.contains(index)<br>&gt; 			self.formIndex(after: &amp;index)<br>&gt; 			return result<br>&gt; 		}<br>&gt; 	}<br>&gt; }<br></p><p>Apologies for the double-post but I’m honour bound to follow up that my generic method is a load of nonsense at the moment; it’s missing some kind of constructor (I don’t recall if there’s a common option that will satisfy this), also, due to the way .filter {} currently works even in its lazy form it can end up calling the filter closure more than once per item, so advancing the index currently won’t work as expected (elements are skipped, children murdered, it’s just the worst).<br></p><p>So yeah, best option to do this right now is with a proper loop over self.indices, but it still requires some kind constructor to build a new copy of the correct type.<br></p><p>For arrays this is a bit simpler as you *can* safely remove indices in reverse order, since later indices cannot invalidate earlier ones, but this is reliant on the array’s indices being integers (reasonable enough, but not really correct in the strictest sense), so like so:<br></p><p>	extension Array {<br>		public mutating func remove(indices: Set&lt;Index&gt;) {<br>			for eachIndex in indices.sort(&gt;) { // greater than should give descending order<br>				self.remove(at: eachIndex)<br>			}<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>But yeah, this is only safe on types where removing later items does not change the order of earlier ones, though this should be true on Array, Dictionary and Set since none of these shrink as elements are removed, it’s not strictly a good idea to rely on this behaviour as it’s implementation dependent, even though it’s unlikely this will change.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160619/6d5bd957/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
