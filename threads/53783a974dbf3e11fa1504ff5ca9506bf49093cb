People who already program might find it easier to understand a free function rather than ..&lt;, which looks like special syntax, but I think beginners (especially in Python, actually) are really floored by range functions. Take, for example:<br></p><p>range(5)<br></p><p>To someone unfamiliar with the function, it could (quite reasonably) mean:<br></p><p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5<br>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5<br>0, 1, 2, 3, 4<br>None of the above<br></p><p>In fact, for people unfamiliar with programming, I’d say that the correct answer is the least obvious. Compare that to:<br></p><p>0..&lt;5<br></p><p>or:<br></p><p>0...4<br></p><p>I think the operator is much easier to understand, and more than makes up for the disadvantages associated with extra operators.<br></p><p>That said, I do think that Strideable is a little unclear. I can’t think of a much better option, though. Maybe something like:<br></p><p>extension Range where Element: Strideable {<br>  public func by(n: Element.Stride) -&gt; StrideTo&lt;Element&gt; {<br>    return startIndex.stride(to: endIndex, by: n)<br>  }<br>}<br>(0..&lt;10).by(2) // [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]<br></p><p>But I’d also want that to work as a subscript. <br></p><p>&gt; On 8 Dec 2015, at 19:01, Kyle Bashour via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Based on much of the discussion regarding removing C-style for-loops, I&#39;d like to propose a discussion on revamping how range works in Swift.
