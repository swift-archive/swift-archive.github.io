But it&#39;s ready for feedback and I&#39;m going to need some<br>encouragement to continue.<br></p><p>In addition, the SwiftGL libraries have been split apart. While they were<br>always meant to work together, none of them depended on each other.<br>Specifically, this addresses software that uses Apple libraries but also<br>wants to use enhanced syntax of the SwiftGL Loader.<br></p><p>-david  http://swiftgl.org/<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20160223/a38fa91a/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11df0828473d6c162b9c8572c37f9146?s=50"></div><header><strong>Learning OpenGL with Swift</strong> from <string>Marco Feltmann</string> &lt;coding at marcofeltmann.de&gt;<p>February 23, 2016 at 10:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Hey David,<br></p><p>I really appreciate this idea!<br></p><p>Unfortunately when I try to build the `Hello Window` tutorial Linux<br>tells me the linker couldn&#39;t find -lglfw3 although I installed it<br>properly.<br></p><p>Well, since I&#39;m on Linux I modified the Package.swift and removed the<br>Dependency Adding stuff since I only need the CGLFW3Linux.git<br></p><p>I have no clue where this linking is done so I&#39;m unable to optimize the<br>`3` out of the linking.
