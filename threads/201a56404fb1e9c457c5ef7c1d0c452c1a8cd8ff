You&#39;re right this wouldn&#39;t necessarily just work. This is far from the only subtle issue with existentials containing subclasses, though; unfortunately there are two levels of dynamic type at play, and we&#39;re pretty inconsistent about keeping them, well, consistent. One approach here might be to try to always store the upper bound class as the existential-dynamic-type of the existential wrapper.<br></p><p>-Joe<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; 	let x: RangeReplaceableCollection = /*...*/<br>&gt;&gt; 	let y: Collection = /*...*/<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	// If y has the same dynamic Element type as x, append it to x<br>&gt;&gt; 	var z: x.Self = x<br>&gt;&gt; 	if let yAsX = y as?
