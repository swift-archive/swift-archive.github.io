When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to<br>&gt; answer in your review:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt; * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a<br>&gt;   change to Swift?<br>&gt; * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt; * If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar<br>&gt;   feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt; * How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick<br>&gt;   reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thank you,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Dave Abrahams<br>&gt; Review Manager<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/60dcb74d816e29b2aa6b9c0b5969670e?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0138 UnsafeBytes</strong> from <string>Xiaodi Wu</string> &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;<p>September  3, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>+1 as well.

This late addition to Swift 3 is a follow-up to SE-0107:<br>&gt; &gt; UnsafeRawPointer. It addresses common use cases for UnsafeRawPointer,<br>&gt; &gt; allowing developers to continue working with collections of UInt8 values,<br>&gt; &gt; but now doing so via a type safe API. The UnsafeBytes API will not<br>&gt; require<br>&gt; &gt; direct manipulation of raw pointers or reasoning about binding memory.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; The proposal is available here:<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &lt;<br>&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0138-unsafebytes.md<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Reviews are an important part of the Swift evolution process.
