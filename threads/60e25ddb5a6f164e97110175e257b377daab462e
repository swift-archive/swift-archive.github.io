I think this is a clean interface for what open should be, and am glad at the simplification. This seems very &quot;Swifty&quot;, and much better than the first proposal. I&#39;m concerned that this may be over-limiting developers, and while everything looks great in theory, I am concerned that this may not be a good decision for real-world development. That said, I also think there are real wins in the ability to at a later date finalise a class for performance reasons, and provides clear structure for how a subclass is designed be used.<br></p><p> * Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>I think that sorting out our inheritance story for public frameworks is important if we are going to start seeing public Swift Frameworks in the wild more often.<br></p><p> * Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>Yes.<br></p><p> * If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>I haven&#39;t. I&#39;ve used Obj-C a lot. The ability to fix some issues with patching leads me to be concerned that we are overly restricting things here.<br></p><p> * How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>I&#39;ve been following the threads since this discussion started months back, in discussions recently over it, and have read thoroughly both reviews.<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160716/60e2462e/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
