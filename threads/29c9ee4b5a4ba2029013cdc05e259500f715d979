A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br>Been following this intensely since last year’s initial discussion, finally came out of the shadows to comment when it came up for review, and have been weighing and listening to arguments for and against; my only &quot;against&quot; feelings came about as a consumer of APIs not as a writer, so I want to make sure its apparent that any negatives I had in the past were from that perspective; I very much support the spirit of this proposal and appreciate those that took time to explain and assuage those concerns! What an amazing process this is. ^o^<br></p><p>-----------<br></p><p>One thing in the proposal:<br>The superclass of an open class must be open. &lt;snip/&gt;. These are conservative restrictions that reduce the scope of this proposal; it will be possible to revisit them in a later proposal.<br>Yes, maybe its an anit-pattern, but I definitely have made many private parent classes and have the child public… the above would mean that I cant do that, as open needs public… it would definitely be appreciated if that is revisited or at least the reasoning (e.g we really shouldn&#39;t be making subclasses of private superclasses public because XYZABC etc).<br></p><p>-----------<br></p><p>Thanks!!<br></p><p><br>&gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thank you,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Chris Lattner<br>&gt; Review Manager<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160716/5f05fa99/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8d9dbc0dfeb74eab8dd9bbd9cbd84680?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review #2] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Jose Cheyo Jimenez</string> &lt;cheyo at masters3d.com&gt;<p>July 16, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>+1 as before but I do have concerns<br></p><p>	* Why do open classes need to have also have open superclasses? <br>	* I don’t think sealed methods/properties as default is the right default. <br>	* If the default was open for methods/properties, then do we really need the sealed keyword?

I believe there are at least an order of magnitude more public member declarations than public class declarations in most projects. For instance, I attempted (using crude, most likely imperfect regex-based algorithms) to estimate the number of classes, methods, properties, and subscripts in Corelibs Foundation, and got these results:<br></p><p>	class: 120<br>	func: 1277<br>	subscript: 6<br>	var: 707<br></p><p>(Note: I removed obviously incorrect things like top-level constants and functions, but these numbers probably still count some struct and enum members.)<br></p><p>Annotating 120 types is not that big a deal relative to the size of Foundation. Annotating 1,990 members introduces much more clutter and tremendously increases the burden of closed-by-default. I don&#39;t think I can support burdening that many declarations with extra syntax; it seems like a lot of red tape for a case where you&#39;ve already explicitly opted in to subclassing.<br></p><p>That&#39;s why I prefer the alternative design of having `open` as a separate access level. I don&#39;t think it is a serious burden to have to search for &quot;public|open&quot; when you want to see all public APIs. Nor do I think it&#39;s a problem that `open` is short. A short keyword would be a problem if our goal is to actually *discourage* subclassing, but if we merely want people to *think* before they subclass, we should be happy that permitting subclassing and overriding is not encumbered with heavyweight keywords.<br></p><p>Meanwhile, the benefits of an `open` access level are manifold:<br></p><p>* It ensures that unsealing is no more burdensome than sealing.<br></p><p>* There&#39;s no need for a &quot;you can&#39;t declare it open because it&#39;s not public&quot; diagnostic.<br></p><p>* It defuses one of the complaints about this change from its critics, easing acceptance.<br></p><p>As an alternative to having `open` as a separate access level, we could instead have it merely imply `public`: the canonical form would be `public open`, but source code could just say `open`.

Yes on closed classes by default.<br></p><p>2. No on closed members by default, unless we use a syntax less burdensome than `public open`.<br></p><p>3.

The video was very well done and very inspirational. The new ipad playground app is a key part of this strategy, the other one being the language. The language has undergone great simplifications since the days of 1.xx with advanced features like tupple splatting or currying now removed, and confusing naming or constructs also gradually removed (3.0 is a very big step in ghat direction). 3) the core team was very clear that it is the direction they want for the language.<br></p><p>&gt; Garth: I think it&#39;s implicit in the reasons to prevent subclassing.

Because it’s difficult to locally reason about your code when members may be substituted by third parties.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; So what does this solution do? It explicitly annotates those members which may be substituted.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This is a general problem - it doesn’t just affect publicly-accessible base classes, but also internal ones. It’s okay to be a bit sloppy with only-internally-open classes because you completely control every substitution, so you can fix any bugs later with an isolated library update. That is the only reason anybody could have for limiting “open” to public scope, as far as I’ve been able to tell — because it makes it easier to be sloppier.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Still, I believe it would not do us any harm, and would actually do quite a bit of good (in light of the Swift API Design guidelines, which promote code which is easy to locally-reason about) if we applied this reasoning to all access scopes.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That is to say, we basically introduce “open&quot; as an inverted “final”, and make all classes non-open by default.

You would be able to “open” them to remove that restriction, and it would be scoped to existing access scopes (as we do already for setter visibility).

It’s just a concession to allow sloppiness inside of your own module, but even then - for complex internal classes with a mixture of overridable and non-overridable members, having to declare those “open” could even be of benefit. If it’s such a big problem, perhaps we can invent some kind of shorthand on the class attribute to declare all of its members overridable (like &quot;open-all” or something).<br></p><p>Karl<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160720/fd50afe4/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review #2] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>July 20, 2016 at 02:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jul 19, 2016, at 6:14 PM, Karl &lt;razielim at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That is to say, we basically introduce “open&quot; as an inverted “final”, and make all classes non-open by default.

Sealed has some sort of complex, scope-specific design (for<br>&gt;&gt; instance, an `internal` class can be subclassed in `fileprivate` but not in<br>&gt;&gt; `internal` scope).<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; Of these three, I think that #2 is overly bureaucratic and #3 is overly<br>&gt;&gt; complicated, so only #1 is a viable option. And then we&#39;re just choosing<br>&gt;&gt; whether we have internal subclassing by default and an odd public-only<br>&gt;&gt; `open` keyword, or no internal subclassing by default and an odd<br>&gt;&gt; public-only `final` keyword. No viable option avoids some kind of asymmetry<br>&gt;&gt; at the `public` boundary.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; Open-by-default with a `final` keyword is the traditional design. It is<br>&gt;&gt; simpler for people learning to program and more familiar for people new to<br>&gt;&gt; Swift. It is more convenient. And you just don&#39;t need the same rigorous,<br>&gt;&gt; formal definition of semantics in internal scope, where you can alter a<br>&gt;&gt; problematic invariant rather than having to live with it.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; All that said, there most likely *is* value in declaring, even<br>&gt;&gt; internally, which classes are meant to be subclassed and which members are<br>&gt;&gt; meant to be overridden. Perhaps what we ought to do is permit `open` even<br>&gt;&gt; on non-public APIs, but not enforce it (or rather, leave enforcement to<br>&gt;&gt; linters). That would allow people and teams to explicitly document internal<br>&gt;&gt; overriding behavior if they want to, without burdening the teams that don&#39;t<br>&gt;&gt; want to go to the effort.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; --<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; Brent Royal-Gordon<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; Architechies<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; This is exactly what I&#39;m talking about - this is actually a very simple<br>&gt;&gt; discussion. Throwing around words like “non-committal” and “affirmative”<br>&gt;&gt; and speaking abstractly doesn’t disguise the brunt of what you’re saying:<br>&gt;&gt; limiting “open” to public classes only lets you be sloppy inside your own<br>&gt;&gt; module. That’s the only reason to make it like that. If I were describing<br>&gt;&gt; the concept of “sloppiness” while trying my hardest not to use the word<br>&gt;&gt; itself, I would probably say pretty much what you just wrote - wanting to<br>&gt;&gt; remain non-committal, avoid definite, affirmative statements, etc.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; If we think it is important for people who write classes to locally<br>&gt;&gt; reason about their code, it’s important full stop. The conflation between<br>&gt;&gt; if it’s publicly accessible and whether or not is a staggeringly massive<br>&gt;&gt; regression in read&amp;reason-ability, no matter how matter how you want to<br>&gt;&gt; phrase it. It’s a general problem which deserves a general solution - not<br>&gt;&gt; some ‘non-committal’ proposal which can&#39;t even commit to the problem it is<br>&gt;&gt; trying to help with.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; If you’ve ever had to deal with complex base classes, consisting of a<br>&gt;&gt; mixture of internal (and possibly internally subclassed) members and public<br>&gt;&gt; ones, you would know that annotating which members are to be used by what<br>&gt;&gt; (and knowing that it’s enforced by the compiler) would be a massive<br>&gt;&gt; improvement to our language syntax. Sometimes you didn’t write all the code<br>&gt;&gt; you have to work with, so it’s handy to have code which annotates this<br>&gt;&gt; stuff.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Karl<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160721/496c9919/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[swift-evolution-announce] [Review #2] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>July 20, 2016 at 06:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jul 20, 2016, at 3:26 PM, Karl &lt;razielim at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Sealed is *non-committal*.

For example, we might want the auto-translator to automatically add open to non-final public methods/properties in existing code, to make it less painful to upgrade. People who simply accept the conversion results will get stuck with un-audited open stuff all over their public APIs, which is not ideal. On the other hand, this is no different to how their existing code behaved in Swift 2, so perhaps it is the best choice.<br></p><p>That&#39;s a good question.  My intuition is that the philosophy of this change suggests that we should leave existing public classes non-open.<br></p><p>&gt; 4. I don’t have a strong opinion on whether “open&quot; should imply “public&quot;. If we accept that “public dynamic” is a stronger promise than “public open&quot;, then it would look strange that the former requires public, while the latter doesn’t. On the other hand, “public open” is going to be much more frequently used than “public dynamic”, so arguably it deserves special treatment.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 5. I was suprised by the restriction that the superclass of open classes must also be open. But I don’t have a convincing usecase against it, so I guess it’s fine. I like that we have the option to revisit this later.<br></p><p>Right.  It&#39;s fully source-compatible to allow this later.<br></p><p>John.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; For fun, here are the distinct combinations of access levels and dispatch clauses for members in a &quot;public open&quot; class after this proposal:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; public dynamic         // plus “public dynamic open” if we keep it separate.<br>&gt; [public] open          // assuming “open” implies “public&quot;<br>&gt; public<br>&gt; public final<br>&gt; [internal] dynamic<br>&gt; [internal]<br>&gt; [internal] final<br>&gt; private dynamic<br>&gt; private<br>&gt; private final<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt; Absolutely.<br>&gt;&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt; Yep.<br>&gt;&gt; 	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt; “Don’t use public subclassing&quot; has been my policy for years, but I have not had the pleasure to use a language that helps me enforce this.<br>&gt;&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review?

Otherwise the logic does not hold, and the original proposal does not hold water: that which cannot be assumed as safe on level 0, cannot be suddenly assumed safe at level 1 of subclassing, because the outer API surface of level-n subclasing forms no more implicite guaranty of soundness than existed at level n-1.

This is a very real and very common issue, and there are endless cases where vendors won’t or even *can’t* solve the problem, especially in closed-source code. And it’s not just a matter of GUI applications; I’ve run into the need to subclass (especially in order to deliver working results in reasonable time) in projects as low-level and open-source as LLVM.<br></p><p>In short, saying &quot;filing a bug will work&quot; isn’t good enough to justify locking out the ability of developers to deal with problems in vendor code. It’s simply not true - it’s certainly almost never been true of Apple frameworks, and even when it has, that doesn’t help anyone &quot;now&quot;. (To be clear, I’m not suggesting Apple is unresponsive to Radars. However, I am saying that there’s no transparency, no confidence in getting fixes, and no hope of any kind of reasonable (from a local perspective) timeline for deployment of fixes.)<br></p><p>In a perfect world, I agree this would be the case and *then* this proposal would be a fantastic concept that I’d be completely behind. Unfortunately, this is not a perfect world and the gains in encouraging good design and cleanliness of applying LSP (among other things) do not make up for the burden of implementation time and cost on framework users.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br></p><p>Yes. But the change is too extreme and the ugly truth of the real world makes this proposal an inferior solution.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Absolutely. If not for the practical considerations, I’d love it! Conceptually speaking, I find it elegant, even harmonious. But again, in practice, the result isn’t so pretty.<br></p><p>&gt; 	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br></p><p>Denial of subclassing has always been opt-in in ever other language I’ve used (C++ and Java, to name two, and Objective-C (and older C++) don’t even have that much). Sealing a class against subclassing is one thing, but not providing any kind of escape hatch, any kind of IUnderstandThatSubclassingMayCauseSunsToGoNovaOrGalaxiesToExplode marker, hamstrings all users of the code. Opt-in sealing at least constrains this scenario to places where the framework writer thought it was worth adding the extra protection against horrible horribleness.<br></p><p>For example, it makes sense to seal NSSomeCryptographicInterface because you’re making it that much harder for something to deliberately interfere with or accidentally break crypto. It makes less sense to seal NSSplitViewController - I’d much rather Apple just said &quot;tough noogies, your subclass breaks in this version because you did something unsupported&quot; when fixing bugs!<br></p><p>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?<br></p><p>I’ve been watching the discussion on this topic back and forth for some time now, and I read both revisions of the proposal carefully. I’m very much conceptually in favor of it, and I regret that I can’t stand behind it! But the fact remains that I think it’s a bad idea.<br></p><p>-- Gwynne Raskind<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review #2] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>July 19, 2016 at 12:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jul 18, 2016, at 11:04 PM, Gwynne Raskind via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Denial of subclassing has always been opt-in in ever other language I’ve used (C++ and Java, to name two, and Objective-C (and older C++) don’t even have that much).

I&#39;m not saying this is the same thing or that arguments against this proposal are not merited (of course they&#39;re merited) but it&#39;s a trade off and I think what we would get in return would be huge and potentially more useful in the long run.

This would be source- and binary-compatible with all existing code; the only wrinkle is that classes compiled with a sealed-by-default compiler would still be sealed. (And that&#39;s not even a problem yet, since stable ABIs are not a thing yet.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The reverse, however, is *not* true. Going from open-by-default to sealed-by-default is source- and binary-incompatible. If we don&#39;t do it now, we may never be able to do it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That means this is our one chance to try this. The outcome is uncertain; there are good arguments that it will improve things, but there are also good arguments that it will make things worse. But if we&#39;re afraid to try this now, we&#39;ll never be able to try it again, and we won&#39;t know if it would have worked. Whereas if we *do* try it now, we can always roll it back later.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Software quality is one of the biggest problems our profession faces. We handle crushing amounts of complexity, teetering towers of abstraction, intertwined code that&#39;s at the ragged edge of our ability to comprehend it. Quite possibly the most urgent need in our industry is tools to help us manage it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Sealed-by-default might turn out to be a powerful tool for managing complexity, helping us prevent unexpected interactions between the implementation details of separate modules. Or it might not. But we ought to find out. If we always take the conservative option, if we always stick to the tried and true, we will never advance the state of the art, never find solutions to the problems that make &quot;all software sucks&quot; a truism.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We need to be bold and take a chance. If it doesn&#39;t work out, we can undo it. But if it does work out, we&#39;ll be better for it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Brent Royal-Gordon<br>&gt; Architechies<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9bfba345bd373f7b8874d58fed6372ff?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review #2] SE-0117: Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly</strong> from <string>David Waite</string> &lt;david at alkaline-solutions.com&gt;<p>July 20, 2016 at 01:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0117-non-public-subclassable-by-default.md<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br></p><p>+1<br></p><p>I don’t necessarily like the idea of sealed-by-default overridability of members, although I will admit it goes along well with the general philosophy of reducing the need for modifiers on internal API.

An answer will have profound<br>ramifications regarding the code that the compiler is allowed to produce.<br>It&#39;s not surprising that different languages give different answers:<br></p><p>- Java and Objective-C say &quot;Yes&quot;<br>- C++ and C# say &quot;No&quot;<br></p><p>Now, it doesn&#39;t look to me like it&#39;s &quot;impossible to use libraries&quot; in those<br>last two languages or that one has &quot;less fun&quot;, or that they are<br>&quot;disadvantaged on the server&quot; because of their design choices.<br></p><p>What it looks like is a tradeoff. A freedom in one place is a requirement<br>in another place – if you say &quot;one should be able to override those<br>methods&quot;, it means &quot;a compiler should be required to perform virtual<br>dispatch on any call to those methods&quot;.<br></p><p>A smart compiler will be able to perform some guaranteed optimizations if<br>it knows that the calls can be devirtualized. This is a good thing, because<br>you can perfrom refactoring &quot;for free&quot;.<br></p><p>As an example, in the scenario below Pyramid.computeVolume() can be<br>devirtualized even if you refactor this class as a subclass of an abstract<br>&quot;Geometric-Body&quot; class and make computeBase() overrideable.<br></p><p>    class Pyramid {<br>         func computeVolume() { return computeBase() * height / 3}<br>         func computeBase() { return π * radius * radius }<br>    }<br></p><p>This ability to extract away the code without the performance penalty and<br>without turning it into an unwanted override point is a benefit of the &quot;No&quot;<br>answer to the aforementioned question.<br></p><p>The ability to quickly design a hierarchy of classes without worrying first<br>about making them virtual is a benefit of the &quot;Yes&quot; answer to the<br>aforementioned question.<br></p><p>What would a good tradeoff then look like? It would combine the advantages<br>of both approaches. I believe that a default &quot;Yes&quot; answer within a module<br>and &quot;No&quot; across the boundary does that.<br></p><p>Therefore I feel like this proposal moves Swift in the right direction.<br></p><p>However, I&#39;m not sure that &#39;open&#39; is the right keyword for functions and<br>would prefer to see more discussion regarding it.<br></p><p>It&#39;s less clear what the benefits of non-open classes are in the dynamic<br>runtime, as we can&#39;t really promise that they will not be subclassed.<br>Incidentally, a lot of the criticism of the proposal touches the usage in<br>Swift of Cocoa Touch APIs. Maybe there is value in leaving things exactly<br>as they currently are in the Objective-C.<br></p><p>*        * How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick<br>reading, or an in-depth study?*<br></p><p>This is the first proposal I feel compelled to respond to.<br></p><p>Many interesting points regarding the proposal have been raised. I&#39;ve spent<br>some time trying to read most of the thread and thought about this question<br>during a day.
