There are certain tools and processes that make more<br>sense than others to keep full control, and I have a few issues regarding<br>this.<br></p><p>My big issue here, are these mailing lists. There are already so much<br>processes around contribution, it&#39;s too difficult to just get in touch with<br>someone over an official channel. The only option I found were these<br>mailing lists. Is Mailman the best solution here, or is the idea that these<br>list are at least something, while the core team continues to investigate<br>potentially better solutions? There are so many better tools available<br>these days, and I would very much recommend to usage of any one of them<br>that removes friction... Gitter or Slack to name a couple.<br></p><p>Secondly, I think having a bug tracking system while all of the code is<br>already on GitHub is kind of moot, or at least confusing. What is the<br>separation between GitHub issues, pull requests, and Jira? Is Jira really<br>being used as a bug tracking system, or more of a project management tool?<br>I would recommend just using, or at least pushing the GitHub features over<br>what Jira provides. This is coming from someone that has been fighting with<br>back and forth Jira and GitHub Enterprise usage over the past 5+ years. If<br>Jira provides something internally that GitHub doesn&#39;t, then use it, but do<br>not force it on the community, it&#39;s confusing.<br></p><p>Third but not least, I know for a fact that Jenkins has GitHub OAuth<br>capability, and I would be curious if Jira, and maybe even Mailman has<br>something similar. If a contributor could sign in to all of these 3+<br>systems with their GitHub account, that would make a high impact in the<br>amount of people that touch this community.<br></p><p>Thanks,<br>-d<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20160313/a58e53c6/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
