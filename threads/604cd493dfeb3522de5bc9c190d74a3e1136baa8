They start with the same words, so anyone looking for ‘map’, ‘filter’, and ‘reduce’ will see them in the autocomplete.<br></p><p>The signatures are also different, so:<br></p><p>let newList = list.map(…)<br></p><p>would throw an error because I have the signature wrong.  Given the consistent naming rules, ‘mapped’ will be tried fairly quickly (especially with auto-complete).  If we are extra worried, we could put in a diagnostic/fixit to teach the ‘mapped’, etc… version.<br></p><p>Seems like needless (and confusing) inconsistency otherwise...<br></p><p>Thanks,<br>Jon<br></p><p>&gt; &gt; What is the rationale behind the name dropFirst()? Being a non-mutating method it should clearly be e.g. droppingFirst() according to the API Naming Guidelines.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Like many `Sequence` and `Collection` operations, `dropFirst()` is a result of the &quot;term of art&quot; exception, which is implied by the &quot;Use Terminology Well&quot; section of the API Guidelines: &lt;https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/#use-terminology-well &lt;https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/#use-terminology-well&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Many languages use `dropWhatever` or `drop_whatever` for operations which return some sort of list with some of its leading or trailing elements removed. For instance:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; * Ruby (which I happen to have in Dash) has `drop(n)` and `drop_while` methods.<br>&gt; * Haskell has `drop n`, `dropWhile`, and `dropWhileEnd` functions.<br>&gt; * Scala has a `drop(n)` method.<br>&gt; * R has a `dropFirst` function.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The standard library has chosen to break its usual patterns in order to maintain consistency with languages like these.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Personally, I believe the term of art exception has been misapplied in this area of the language; the precedents are not very strong, and the resulting APIs form a patchwork of inconsistent names rather than a coherent family. The term of art exception increases the clarity of calls like `map` and `filter` where the names are truly universal, but it impedes the clarity of the whole family of `first`/`prefix`/`suffix`/`last` calls, and the names should be revisited and rationalized. But that hasn&#39;t happened yet.<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160616/604cbaa8/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>API Guidelines: dropFirst?</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>June 16, 2016 at 04:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; The signatures are also different, so:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let newList = list.map(…)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; would throw an error because I have the signature wrong.<br></p><p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by this.
