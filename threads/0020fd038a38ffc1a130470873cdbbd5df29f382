The branch will be used to provide a more stable baseline for producing qualified snapshots for Swift 3.  With a large number of Swift 3 changes having landed the idea is to provide more qualified downloads — probably called “developer previews” or something of that nature — that will be available for those interested in playing with Swift 3 but not wanting to pull just the latest snapshots from master.  I’ll post details on how this branch will be managed via a blog post in the next couple days.  For the time being, you can just ignore it — but I wanted to give everyone a heads up on why it was there.<br></p><p>Ted<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160427/0020f382/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
