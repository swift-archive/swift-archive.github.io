The swiftStubs and swiftRuntime are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; statically compiled and then merged into swiftCore.  There is also the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; concern of the the support modules (e.g. Platform).  If there are stubs<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; that are being used (e.g. via _silgen_name) then there are issues with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; calculating the correct DLL storage for the associated global values.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Playing around with this, I was trying to special case the building of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; the standard library (as the runtime will be statically linked into it, the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; symbols that it is expecting to be externally available are actually<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; private linkage.  Not hacking up the compiler like this causes issues since<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; there are inverse dependencies (swiftCore gets dllimport interfaces from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swiftRuntime, which has dependencies on swiftCore).  The crux of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; problem is that we do not have a way to represent that in swift.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The easiest answer that seems to come to mind is to actually introduce<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; an attribute to indicate that an interface is part of a specific module and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; assume that everything else is locally defined.  This would also<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; potentially allow us to handle things like @inline(always) @transparent<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; interfaces which get imported to ensure that a static inline function is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; given local visibility rather than a DLL Import storage.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I believe that currently Im stuck as I do not have a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; good way to determine what type of dll storage class a symbol should be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; given (since currently, theres no way to determine if we will have a symbol<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; available locally or not when actually linking).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; It seems to me, at least initially, that we need a way to treat<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; SwiftModule as a container (a la llvm::Module) and indicate which of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; TopLevelDecls are meant to be a single &quot;module&quot; (DSO, DLL, whatever you<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; want to call it) so that we can properly track the DLL storage associated<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; with them.  Am I confusing something there?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Is there a preference on a means to handle this?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The runtime is linked as part of the standard library, and its ABI<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; interface should be exported from libswiftCore.dylib/so/dll like the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; standard library&#39;s. We should already mark up the ABI entry points with the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; SWIFT_RUNTIME_EXPORT and SWIFT_RUNTIME_STDLIB_INTERFACE macros. Is it not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; sufficient to expand these macros to __dllexport?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The definitions can be marked as __declspec(dllexport) but the compiler<br>&gt;&gt; generated references need to be dllimport for the wrapped runtime functions<br>&gt;&gt; (easy for the most part -- see my changes).  There&#39;s also the concern of<br>&gt;&gt; stubs for the aliases (via silgen_name).  Those are defined externally with<br>&gt;&gt; no indication that they are locally available and thus should have default<br>&gt;&gt; rather than dllimport storage.  Similar things for standard library<br>&gt;&gt; metadata (type, witness tables, etc).<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A gentle reminder on this topic.  I would like to get something sorted out<br>&gt; so that we can try to get this resolved, preferably before the swift 3<br>&gt; release.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Just to chime in here (as asked by Saleem, um, a month ago) I think this<br>&gt; is the right way to go. We should handle the DLL-ish case (mark public<br>&gt; things ‘dllexport’ and references outside the Swift module ‘dllimport’),<br>&gt; and not worry about static linking (unnecessary dllimports).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; (It seems __declspec(dllexport) is exactly the same as LLVM ‘public’ vs<br>&gt; ‘hidden’—at least for Swift’s uses, even if that isn’t true generally.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; We can then come back later and design / add some kind of “I know this<br>&gt; object file is going to be statically linked into the executable” mode,<br>&gt; which will drop all the dllexports. We’d also want to encode this flag into<br>&gt; the serialized “swiftmodule” files (a library’s public interface), so that<br>&gt; we know not to use dllimport for anything we use from there.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Thanks for pushing on this!<br>&gt; Jordan<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-dev mailing list<br>&gt; swift-dev at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-dev<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160506/1e5a3074/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/06c1dcc7dce6a93d194b9c013376e3f0?s=50"></div><header><strong>swift (ABI) and Windows</strong> from <string>Joe Groff</string> &lt;jgroff at apple.com&gt;<p>May  5, 2016 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On May 5, 2016, at 4:18 PM, Sangjin Han via swift-dev &lt;swift-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hi,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I made an experimental MSVC port.

In particular, there are mismatches between<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; what gets compiled and is desired.

If there are stubs<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; that are being used (e.g. via _silgen_name) then there are issues with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; calculating the correct DLL storage for the associated global values.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Playing around with this, I was trying to special case the building of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; the standard library (as the runtime will be statically linked into it, the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; symbols that it is expecting to be externally available are actually<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; private linkage.

There&#39;s also the concern of<br>&gt;&gt; stubs for the aliases (via silgen_name).

We *could* just assume<br>&gt; that the any time that the LLVM module name is &quot;Swift.*&quot; we are building<br>&gt; the stdlib and not mark the runtime functions for external (import) dll<br>&gt; storage, but this seems rather fragile.  The problem is that at IRGen time,<br>&gt; we no longer have access to  the SILModule (AFAIK), so we don&#39;t have a way<br>&gt; to identify if we are the stdlib or not.  Suggestions on how to handle that<br>&gt; would be appreciated.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Thanks for pushing on this!<br>&gt;&gt; Jordan<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; --<br>&gt; Saleem Abdulrasool<br>&gt; compnerd (at) compnerd (dot) org<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-dev mailing list<br>&gt; swift-dev at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-dev<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160512/505604ed/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/05d93b58565bbc562ecb20fc9f8e6009?s=50"></div><header><strong>swift (ABI) and Windows</strong> from <string>Paul Menage</string> &lt;paul at paulmenage.org&gt;<p>October  7, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Wed, May 11, 2016 at 9:23 AM, Saleem Abdulrasool via swift-dev<br>&lt;swift-dev at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Unfortunately, ATM, the runtime is compacted into the stdlib, which has the<br>&gt; small problem of making the stdlib have references to the runtime functions<br>&gt; as if it were being dynamically linked.
