Has anyone tried to see how common it is to have a `for` loop whose first statement is an `if` or `guard` and whose body is simply a `break`? That&#39;d be a little complex to search for, but I think it would be pretty helpful in evaluating the need, or lack thereof, for something like `while`.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
