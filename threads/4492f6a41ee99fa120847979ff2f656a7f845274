Here we are trying to invent new syntax so that the trailing closure can be used in if/while conditions and for sequences. However, there is already a perfectly good syntax for putting closures in these positions: put the closure in the parentheses of the function call. Are people really so desperate to use trailing closures everywhere that we have to add new keywords to the language? I don’t think they are.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; While I kind of agree (and personally prefer the use of parenthesis in most places anyway) it’s an inconsistency to be unable to use them I think. While It’s understandable from a parsing/ambiguity perspective, it’s not really intuitive.<br></p><p>But the resolution would be another inconsistency i.e. a separate keyword that is only required if the condition has a trailing closure. Furthermore, that is an inconsistency that adds extra complexity to the language.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I like the consistency of every block having a kind of type (do, else, defer, catch etc.). <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; That is a rabbit hole down which you probably shouldn&#39;t go. If we go down the route of blocks having a “type”, the current situation in Swift becomes somewhat inconsistent. I would argue that the `else` block on a `guard` is of a different type to the `else` block on an `if`. If anything, the `else` block of an `if` is closer to the `then` block. Also, would you allow the `do` block in a `for` or `while` to have a `catch` block following it? If not, then these blocks are different to the  existing bare `do` block. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Actually that’s not quite what I meant by “type”; while there is a case to be made for unifying these more (else and catch on loops for example) I just meant more along the lines that “do” would always group the main branch, “else” indicates an alternative path if a condition isn’t met and so-on.

The point of trailing closure syntax is to allow user-defined functions to look like natural control flow statements. This is especially true for guard and the omission of the capability is an obvious oversight. The arguments against it seem to be arguments against trailing closure syntax entirely which is a separate issue from this proposal. So long as trailing closure syntax exists it should be usable in a guard statement.<br></p><p><br>&gt; How much effort did you put into your review?

I like the rule of “don’t make me think”. If I write a piece of code that seems correct to me, why would the compiler “intentionally” stop me from accepting it? Just smooth out this rough edge and remove one scenario in which a compiler error stops me in my work for an error that’s not essential complexity.<br></p><p>Yes, the price of it is a slight inconsistency, as this won’t work with `if foo { … } {`. But I seriously doubt anyone would actually *see* this as inconsistent. Most programmers would just not be stopped for writing `guard foo { … } else`, and would never notice. No error, no problem :) It’s just that now there’s one less place that is a potential error generator ;)<br></p><p>So, yeah, it seems like a fairly straightforward improvement.
