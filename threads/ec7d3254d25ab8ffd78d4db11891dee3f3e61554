You can use a<br>&gt; capture list to explicitly control how values are captured in a closure.”<br>&gt; from: Apple Inc. “The Swift Programming Language (Swift 3 beta)”。 iBooks.<br>&gt; https://itun.es/us/k5SW7.l<br></p><p><br></p><p>Zhaoxin<br></p><p><br></p><p><br>On Sun, Jul 24, 2016 at 5:07 PM, Tyler Fleming Cloutier via swift-users &lt;<br>swift-users at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; The Swift Programming Language book states:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &quot;Reference counting only applies to instances of classes. Structures and<br>&gt; enumerations are value types, not reference types, and are not stored and<br>&gt; passed by reference.”<br>&gt;<br>&gt; However consider the following example.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; func makeIncrementer() -&gt; (() -&gt; Int, () -&gt; Int) {<br>&gt;     var runningTotal = 0<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     func incrementer() -&gt; Int {<br>&gt;         runningTotal += 1<br>&gt;         return runningTotal<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     func incrementer2() -&gt; Int {<br>&gt;         runningTotal += 1<br>&gt;         return runningTotal<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     return (incrementer, incrementer2)<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; let x = makeIncrementer()<br>&gt;<br>&gt; x.0() // 1<br>&gt; x.1() // 2<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Clearly runningTotal is captured by reference by both incrementer and<br>&gt; incrementer2. Is closure capturing the only case in which value types are<br>&gt; treated as reference types?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Why wouldn’t Swift be implement so that runningTotal was Captured as a<br>&gt; static copy at the time of capture so that each of the incrementer<br>&gt; functions has their own “value”?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It seems like you could pretty easily run into a retain cycle with a<br>&gt; struct even though it is a value type!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Consider:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; struct MyValueType {<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     var x: () -&gt; ()<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     init() {<br>&gt;         self.x = {<br>&gt;             print(self)<br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; One might imagine that the capture of a value type like MyValueType would<br>&gt; make a static copy of self for the closure, but if I understand correctly I<br>&gt; actually just get a retain cycle. But it’s even worse, because (as I<br>&gt; understand it) whether I do or not is optimization dependent!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &quot;As an optimization, Swift may instead capture and store a *copy* of a<br>&gt; value if that value is not mutated by a closure, and if the value is not<br>&gt; mutated after the closure is created.”<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Now it turns out that as of SE-0035 I get an error for the above code.<br>&gt; Namely,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; “Closure cannot implicitly capture a mutating self parameter.”<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Kind of a strange error message for two reasons. The first is that nothing<br>&gt; appears to be doing any mutating or declaring an intention of mutating. The<br>&gt; second is that it’s not clear at all (to me at least) how to go about<br>&gt; remedying the issue.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If I capture self explicitly with something like [s = self], am I getting<br>&gt; a copy of self or a reference to self? I would assume a copy of self, but<br>&gt; that’s not super clear given the somewhat surprising behavior of capturing<br>&gt; value types by reference.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I would think the following would be a valid solution. Is there a better<br>&gt; one?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; struct MyValueType {<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     var x: (() -&gt; ())!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     init() {<br>&gt;         self.x = nil<br>&gt;         self.x = { [s = self] in<br>&gt;             print(s)<br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Is there a way to use currying to be more explicit about the semantics of<br>&gt; passing a value into a closure?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Any help or discussion would be much appreciated!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Tyler<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-users mailing list<br>&gt; swift-users at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-users<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20160724/6158540e/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
