Second, I think you&#39;re<br>misunderstanding the feedback here. The swift-evolution list is not a<br>mailing list for Swift community discussions in general. It&#39;s a mailing<br>list for proposals to change the core language (how do generics work? how<br>does control flow work? what about arrays, dictionaries, strings?). You&#39;ll<br>want to write to swift-users, or another forum where the Swift community is<br>active, to get feedback and participation about other libraries. If there&#39;s<br>something in the core language that you&#39;ll need to hook into to make<br>Android apps work better, then this is a great place to propose those<br>specific changes, and you could demonstrate a compelling use case by<br>describing how it enables critical features in your third-party library.<br></p><p>Cheers,<br></p><p>X<br></p><p><br>On Tue, Oct 11, 2016 at 4:34 PM, Tony Constantinides via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Ok,<br>&gt; Any other feedback from the Swift community other than it does not belong<br>&gt; as part of Swift?

You have to remember I am very new to interfacing<br>&gt;&gt; with the Swift team hence the cautious approach. I do realize this is a<br>&gt;&gt; proposal and not a pitch and I am prepare to provide a great many more<br>&gt;&gt; details in a proposal. If you wish to point me to another swift mailing<br>&gt;&gt; list then please do so. If you feel this a &quot;third party lib&quot; then tell me<br>&gt;&gt; where it slots in. In other words be helpful and not react like a teen age<br>&gt;&gt; girl.<br>&gt;&gt;   Of course I will begin development of this feature on github and give<br>&gt;&gt; talks to my local developer group. When I create a github with this<br>&gt;&gt; framework I going to have to add a licence.  Making the software<br>&gt;&gt; copyrighted to my company and not link to the swift.org project in any<br>&gt;&gt; way seem odd to me. Not my idea of &quot;open source&quot; or contributing to a<br>&gt;&gt; &quot;major open source project&quot;. You state that the Swift community members<br>&gt;&gt; have spent a great deal of time and effort in getting getting Swift to even<br>&gt;&gt; build on Android. Congrats! I here to take it to the next level.<br>&gt;&gt;  If there is Swift community interest the code will be free via open<br>&gt;&gt; source. If there is none and judging by the response from the developers in<br>&gt;&gt; my &quot;Bay Area Android Developer meetup group&quot; that hard to believe then I<br>&gt;&gt; make it it commercial software to be sold.<br>&gt;&gt;  Many thanks in advance.<br>&gt;&gt; Sincerely yours,<br>&gt;&gt; Tony Constantinides<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; On Mon, Oct 10, 2016 at 11:15 AM, Adrian Zubarev &lt;<br>&gt;&gt; adrian.zubarev at devandartist.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s disappointing that you seem not to understand what this mailing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; list is for. Building a Framework does not require the evolution process.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s all up to you to open a GitHub repository and just start building.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure you can ask for help, but I believe other platforms like<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; stackoverflow or even swift-users would be a better place for that.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; And I think your statement about rejection is totally wrong.
