The interpolation machinery, however, has surprising behavior in one specific case: Optional&lt;T&gt;. If a user puts an optional value into a string interpolation segment, it will insert either &quot;Optional(&quot;value&quot;)&quot; or &quot;nil&quot; in the resulting string. Neither of these is particularly desirable, so we propose a warning and fix-it to surface solutions to these potential mistakes.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Swift-evolution thread: Discussion thread topic for that proposal &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/harlanhaskins/63b7343e7fe4e5f4c6cfbe9413a98fdd#motivation&gt;Motivation<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Swift Programming Language defines string interpolation segments as &quot;a way to construct a new String value from a mix of constants, variables, literals, and expressions&quot;. There is one type that runs counter to this definition: Optional. The .none case in particular is used to indicate the absence of a value. Moreover, its inclusion in interpolation segments leads to the dreaded &quot;nil&quot; in output that is often fed to UI elements. Even barring that, interpolating a non-nil optional value yields &quot;Optional(&quot;value&quot;)&quot;, a result that is not useful even in logged output.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Given that the Optional type is never fit for display to the end user, and can often be a surprising find in the console, we propose that requesting an Optional&#39;s debug description be an explicit act. This proposal now requires a warning when using an expression of Optional type within a string interpolation segment.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/harlanhaskins/63b7343e7fe4e5f4c6cfbe9413a98fdd#proposed-solution&gt;Proposed solution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The user will be warned after attempting to use an expression with type Optional&lt;T&gt; in a string interpolation segment. They will then be offered a fixit suggesting they explicitly request the debugDescription of the Optional value instead.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/harlanhaskins/63b7343e7fe4e5f4c6cfbe9413a98fdd#detailed-design&gt;Detailed design<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Semantic analysis currently does not do much but guarantee the well-formedness of expressions in interpolation segments. These are then fed directly to String.init(stringInterpolationSegment:) and are run through the runtime reflection system to generate a description. Semantic analysis will be tweaked to inspect the result of solving an interpolation segment for an Optional and will offer a fixit in that case.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &lt;https://gist.github.com/harlanhaskins/63b7343e7fe4e5f4c6cfbe9413a98fdd#impact-on-existing-code&gt;Impact on existing code<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As this is a warning, code written before this proposal will continue to compile and run with the same semantics as before.

The interpolation machinery, however, has surprising behavior in one specific case: Optional&lt;T&gt;. If a user puts an optional value into a string interpolation segment, it will insert either &quot;Optional(&quot;value&quot;)&quot; or &quot;nil&quot; in the resulting string. Neither of these is particularly desirable, so we propose a warning and fix-it to surface solutions to these potential mistakes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Swift-evolution thread: Discussion thread topic for that proposal<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Motivation<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The Swift Programming Language defines string interpolation segments as &quot;a way to construct a new String value from a mix of constants, variables, literals, and expressions&quot;. There is one type that runs counter to this definition: Optional. The .none case in particular is used to indicate the absence of a value. Moreover, its inclusion in interpolation segments leads to the dreaded &quot;nil&quot; in output that is often fed to UI elements. Even barring that, interpolating a non-nil optional value yields &quot;Optional(&quot;value&quot;)&quot;, a result that is not useful even in logged output.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Given that the Optional type is never fit for display to the end user, and can often be a surprising find in the console, we propose that requesting an Optional&#39;s debug description be an explicit act. This proposal now requires a warning when using an expression of Optional type within a string interpolation segment.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Proposed solution<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The user will be warned after attempting to use an expression with type Optional&lt;T&gt; in a string interpolation segment. They will then be offered a fixit suggesting they explicitly request the debugDescription of the Optional value instead.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Detailed design<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Semantic analysis currently does not do much but guarantee the well-formedness of expressions in interpolation segments. These are then fed directly to String.init(stringInterpolationSegment:) and are run through the runtime reflection system to generate a description. Semantic analysis will be tweaked to inspect the result of solving an interpolation segment for an Optional and will offer a fixit in that case.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Impact on existing code<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As this is a warning, code written before this proposal will continue to compile and run with the same semantics as before. Authors of code that makes use of this unsafe pattern will be offered a migration path to the safer, more explicit form.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Alternatives considered<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A fixit that suggests a default value be inserted would be entirely appropriate (following the style of the fixit introduced in SE-0140).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Forbidding this pattern by hard error would make this proposal a breaking change that is out of scope for this stage of Swift&#39;s development.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A fixit that introduces a force-unwrapping would technically work as well, however it would be fixing a dangerous operation with yet another dangerous operation.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Sent from my iPad<br></p><p>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6451ee8093c9cedc94f6c813b4dde2c5?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal draft] Disallow Optionals in String Interpolation Segments</strong> from <string>Kevin Ballard</string> &lt;kevin at sb.org&gt;<p>October  3, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>On Mon, Oct 3, 2016, at 10:52 AM, Harlan Haskins via swift-evolution wrote:<br>&gt; Swift developers frequently use string interpolation as a convenient,<br>&gt; concise syntax for interweaving variable values with strings.

This combined with the warning for naively interpolating an Optional would be a good solution, because now when I see the warning I can trivially solve it with `?? &quot;nil”`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If you can suppress the warning with `as T?` (where T? is the type of the thing being warned on), you wouldn’t need a form that specifically printed “nil”, correct?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; How many times do I need to repeat myself? I&#39;m looking for a solution to the problem where printing Optionals sanely (e.g. no &quot;Optional(…)&quot; wrapper for .some values) is a PITA right now. Getting rid of the warning does not solve this problem. This is why I like Nate Cook&#39;s idea to enable `?? &quot;nil&quot;` in string interpolations, because it does solve my problem. And with this tool, now the warning on printing Optionals becomes useful because it tells me where to add `?? &quot;nil&quot;`. Getting rid of the warning without the ability to add `?? &quot;nil&quot;` is not helpful to me, because I don&#39;t want to print &quot;Optional(…)&quot;.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; A string interpolation segment can accept any type, so &#39;x ?? &quot;nil&quot;&#39; arguably ought to be able to work by joining both sides of the ?? to &#39;Any&#39;, as if you&#39;d written `(x as Any?) ?? (&quot;nil&quot; as Any)`. IIRC we have some artificial limitations on deducing `Any`, since it can obviously be problematic to have things like array literals automatically fall into [Any] because you accidentally mixed types, but string interpolations are loosely-typed by design. I wonder if there&#39;s anything we could do to admit it in this case.<br></p><p>We generally don&#39;t consider existential types as a meet of two non-existential types because (1) finding the most-precise common existential type involves enumerating all the known conformances of each type, which is problematic for a number of reasons, and (2) it can be done for two completely arbitrary types because of Any, but we don&#39;t want things like (flag ? &quot;foo&quot; : 123) to type-check without some sort of type annotation.<br></p><p>John.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20161004/16f1346a/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0e8516d3703e35b7df26986815b23e7a?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal draft] Disallow Optionals in String Interpolation Segments</strong> from <string>Robert Widmann</string> &lt;devteam.codafi at gmail.com&gt;<p>October  4, 2016 at 02:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>It&#39;s an interesting idea that needs to be written down in a separate proposal and is tangentially related to the problem we are trying to solve here and now.

We specifically mention that we didn’t spring for a hard error because that would make this a source-breaking proposal and we realize that it is useful to be able to quickly print an optional to test something.  But at the end of the day you should think about the representation of data flowing through your program and be explicit about whether you want the debug interpretation of an optional value or whether you intended - as we believe is true of the majority of cases - to provide a default non-optional value.<br></p><p>&gt; On Oct 3, 2016, at 9:54 PM, Kevin Ballard &lt;kevin at sb.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Mon, Oct 3, 2016, at 06:49 PM, Robert Widmann wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Oct 3, 2016, at 8:49 PM, Kevin Ballard via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I assume you meant that as a reply to me?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem is twofold:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Printing the value without adornment, or &quot;nil&quot; for nil, is a very common thing to want to do and we shouldn&#39;t have to write code like `\(x.map(String.init(describing:)) ?? &quot;nil&quot;)` to accomplish it.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; My point is before you were unable to do this without the ‘uglyness’ presented here anyway [you would have gotten “Optional(“value”)”], so I don’t see the point of raising this concern.  If you want the old behavior, just ask for it with an explicit cast or `.debugDescription`.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This proposal was done because the current behavior of Optionals in string interpolation isn&#39;t very useful for most people.
