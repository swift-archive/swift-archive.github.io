Most of the times I <br>&gt; used it in ifs, fors and switches I ended up thinking it hardened <br>&gt; readability of my code (perhaps because of placement, but I do not <br>&gt; think alternatives made it more readable) and so it was my decision to <br>&gt; stop using where whenever possible in my code. Since Erica&#39;s <br>&gt; performance test pointed out using guard is nearly as fast as using <br>&gt; where and the core team is removing wheres from ifs, I think the ones <br>&gt; in fors could go next.<br></p><p>Interestingly, I find where clauses in `for` to be a useful tool to <br>*improve* readibility. To me, it flows much better to write &amp; read this:<br></p><p>    for (start, duration) in days where calendar.isDateInWeekend(start) {<br>        ...<br>    }<br></p><p>rather than this:<br></p><p>	for (start, duration) in days {<br>        guard calendar.isDateInWeekend(start) else { continue }<br>        ...<br>    }<br></p><p>or this:<br></p><p>	for (start, duration) in days.filter({ calendar.isDateInWeekend($0.0) }) {<br>		...<br>	}<br></p><p>Of these three, I&#39;d argue the first is the easiest to understand for a <br>person who&#39;s never seen Swift code before. (Admittedly I doubt that&#39;s <br>something languages should be optimized for, though.) The extra <br>punctuation and the use of $0 instead of the loop&#39;s bindings makes the <br>third approach seem especially noisy &amp; scary.<br></p><p>Obviously, editorial tools like this aren&#39;t essential, and I could <br>easily adapt to live without such syntactic sugar. But I do not like <br>the idea of systematically ridding the language of such charming <br>constructs when there is no technical reason to do so. SE-0099 fixed a <br>technical problem with the syntax of a shorthand construct, without <br>removing it from the language. It did not bring back Swift 1&#39;s `if` <br>pyramids.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, Erica is absolutely right about `switch`: while `where` <br>clauses are arguably non-essential in `for` loops, `switch` statements <br>would lose a great deal of their expressive power without them. For <br>example, in the following snippet (taken from a lexer in SwiftPM), all <br>cases are logically at the same level. I think it&#39;s a win that Swift <br>allows them to be expressed as such, and I&#39;d strongly object to a <br>proposal that removed this capability.<br></p><p>    switch c {<br>    case UInt8(ascii: &quot;\n&quot;): ...<br>    case UInt8(ascii: &quot;#&quot;): ...<br>    case let c where c.isSpace(): ...<br>    case UInt8(ascii: &quot;\&quot;&quot;): ...<br>    case let c where c.isNumberInitialChar(): ...<br>    case let c where c.isIdentifierChar(): ...<br>    case UInt8(ascii: &quot;,&quot;): ...<br>    case UInt8(ascii: &quot;=&quot;): ...<br>    case UInt8(ascii: &quot;[&quot;): ...<br>    case UInt8(ascii: &quot;]&quot;): ...<br>    case UInt8(ascii: &quot;.&quot;): ...<br>    default: ...<br>    }<br></p><p>Obviously, we could rewrite this to use a single `if` ladder, but I <br>think most would not find that an improvement.<br></p><p>(The same argument applies to `catch` statements, although with less force.)<br></p><p>As long as `where` is kept in `switch` and `catch`, and as long the <br>grammar is unambiguous, I think there is little point to removing where <br>clauses from `for`. To improve consistency, I&#39;d not mind if SE-0099 <br>kept `where` as an alternative way to spell `,` in `if` statements, too.<br></p><p>-- <br>Károly<br>@lorentey<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
