Equally, as far<br>as I recall, it hasn&#39;t been presented for review yet. It&#39;s neither accepted<br>nor rejected. How its type-based access nature works with Swift&#39;s<br>scope-based access system will be an interesting topic. Perhaps now&#39;s a<br>good time to start it.<br>Second: however ugly you find &#39;fileprivate&#39;, you understood what it meant.<br>Not knowing which of &#39;local&#39; and &#39;private&#39; was implicitly more private<br>drove a lot of that discussion; that&#39;s why &#39;fileprivate&#39; won. It&#39;s also a<br>relative term - for example, since it would be pointless to declare a<br>protocol as &#39;local&#39; in your hierarchy (since it would then be impossible<br>for another type to conform to it), the protocol would be declared as<br>&#39;private&#39; but would have &#39;fileprivate&#39; visibility, which means you wouldn&#39;t<br>see &#39;fileprivate&#39; perhaps as often as you&#39;re concerned about.<br></p><p>On Sun, May 8, 2016 at 9:13 PM, Vanderlei Martinelli via swift-evolution &lt;<br>swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Hello.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I had a health problem and recently I needed a surgery because of it.
