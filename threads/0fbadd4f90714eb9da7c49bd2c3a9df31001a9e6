The 75% failure chance and 25%<br>success chance are strictly from clean builds. Once a build fails or<br>succeeds, it will continue to do so 100% of the time until a clean. (All of<br>this is assuming no source changes.) I have only experienced this one mode<br>of failure, as far as I can tell, and when builds succeed, the framework is<br>generated and code that uses it builds and runs as expected.<br></p><p>I&#39;ve opened a bug at bugreporter.apple.com with ID 25511119 and clearer<br>information.<br></p><p>By the way - I didn&#39;t mention it in the ticket because I&#39;m not confident it<br>has anything to do with this issue - but when building previous iterations<br>of this code with previous versions of Xcode that used Swift 2.1, I saw<br>reliable compilation failures in which the order of generic type<br>constraints&#39; members mattered. That is, given the following two protocols:<br></p><p>protocol Foo { typealias Bar }<br>protocol Baz { typealias Buzz }<br></p><p>This would work:<br>struct MyGoodStruct&lt;T: protocol&lt;Baz, Foo&gt; where T.Bar == T.Buzz, T.Bar:<br>IntegerType&gt; {}<br></p><p>And this would not:<br>struct MyBadStruct&lt;T: protocol&lt;Baz, Foo&gt; where T.Buzz == T.Bar, T.Bar:<br>IntegerType&gt; {}<br></p><p>As far as I could tell, this had been fixed in Swift 2.2. I bring this up<br>only because these new linking failures seem to be related to<br>ostrichframework&#39;s Instruction protocol and its implementors.<br></p><p>Thanks again,<br>Ryan<br></p><p>On Sat, Apr 2, 2016 at 9:41 AM, Daniel Dunbar &lt;daniel_dunbar at apple.com&gt;<br>wrote:<br></p><p>&gt; Are you saying that it fails about 75% of the time even when building from<br>&gt; clean, or it fails overall 75% of the time and you have to build from clean<br>&gt; to fix?
