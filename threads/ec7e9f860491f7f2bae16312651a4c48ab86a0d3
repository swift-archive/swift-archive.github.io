However,<br>&gt; an interpreter seemed like the easier choice.)<br>&gt; <br></p><p>Sorry I missed this yesterday.  My normal gmail account is missing from the lists, so my last answer was made without seeing this first.<br></p><p>The Swift REPL works by injecting code into a separate Swift process.  The code is JIT-ed and then run in the separate process by way of LLDB’s highly-specialized code used to control other processes (as one would expect to find in a debugger).  It would be challenging to adapt that code as is to run in the same process (as it sounds like you want, for purposes of app customization along the lines of Python/Maya, elisp/Emacs, etc.)  However, it certainly would act as a template on how to do it.  I don’t think you’d want to try to build the app incorporating LLDB, because LLDB brings with it a whole lot of functionality that is likely not useful unless your app is a debugger.<br></p><p>The places to start looking would be any of the files with *Expression* to get a sense of how our expression engine works.  The Swift specific ones will set up a context to compile, JIT and run code.  The run part is what you would likely need to change, as instead of sending code over to another process, usurping a thread, and sending results back, your code will instead want to arrange to run the newly JIT-ed code in the local process.<br></p><p>I don’t think interpreting will be easier if you plan to base your code on what you find in LLDB.  The JIT is all there, but I don’t think there is any existing interpreter code (Sean - please correct me if I’m wrong here).  Unless that’s incorrect, I think you’d find that you need to write more code to handle interpreting rather than JIT-ing it.<br></p><p>Hope that helps!<br></p><p>-Todd<br></p><p>&gt; Perry<br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Perry E.

Just one more question: For any project, how is a C to Swift function binding created? I&#39;d like to know how to import C functions to Swift. Once I can do this successfully, I&#39;ll be all set. <br></p><p>That&#39;s a question that is more appropriate for swift-users.  You want the place where some compiler folks hang out...<br></p><p>Jim<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; Sent from Outlook<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Sun, Dec 6, 2015 at 10:39 PM -0800, &quot;Todd Fiala&quot; &lt;todd.fiala at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hi Gage,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The REPL does let you import Swift modules.  If you wanted to make or find a GTK binding, load it into the REPL, and drive that via the REPL, you certainly could do that.  Using the REPL to do this would allow you to explore the binding at runtime, as many REPL-based languages afford.  Is that the kind of thing you&#39;re after?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The last comment makes me think you may be asking more about a graphical REPL, though.  Xcode has Playgrounds, but that doesn&#39;t exist in Open Source Swift.  I don&#39;t see what would stop somebody from trying to write something similar against GTK or any other GUI library.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hope that helps!<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Todd<br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Sun, Dec 6, 2015 at 6:12 PM, Gage Morgan &lt;gagemorgan at outlook.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt; The Swift-specific parts (i.e. any files not in the llvm.org LLDB source base) are &gt; available according to the license as specified at swift.org.

I meant &quot;Has Apple stated possible uses for REPL other than from the CLI-only interface?&quot; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m looking to develop GUIs with it, but am unsure how. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks,<br>&gt; --MGage--<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Sent from Outlook<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _____________________________<br>&gt; From: Todd Fiala via swift-lldb-dev &lt;swift-lldb-dev at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; Sent: Saturday, December 5, 2015 7:33 PM<br>&gt; Subject: [swift-lldb-dev] REPL questions<br>&gt; To: &lt;swift-lldb-dev at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hi all,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks for the questions on the REPL.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; With respect to incorporating a REPL into another program, the text-based Swift REPL is available in and implemented via LLDB.  As Swift LLDB is implemented on top of LLDB, there are two projects involved with regards to the source.  The source code for the core of LLDB (as available via llvm.org) is available according to the terms of the license as spelled out at llvm.org.  The Swift-specific parts (i.e. any files not in the llvm.org LLDB source base) are available according to the license as specified at swift.org.  I would direct you to those licenses to see if they are compatible with your desired usage.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; There are at least a few apps that incorporate LLDB into their IDEs, either via the SB API (the LLDB C++-based API), via the GDB Remote protocol, and via the GDB mi protocol (via lldb-mi).  It is definitely possible to go the route of setting up an app that communicates with LLDB to get a REPL experience that way.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;ll be able to comment more directly on questions this upcoming week.<br>&gt; --  <br>&gt; -Todd<br>&gt;  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; -Todd<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-lldb-dev mailing list<br>&gt; swift-lldb-dev at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-lldb-dev<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
