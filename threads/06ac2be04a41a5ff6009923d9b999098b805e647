And of course because this is a coercion, it produces a temporary, and you can&#39;t use temporaries with inout parameters, so that preserves the invariance of arrays passed as inout parameters such as mutating methods (although if you could pass a temporary it would still be safe because it would write back to that temporary instead of the original array; this would be very confusing though which is why it&#39;s disallowed).<br>&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt; -Kevin Ballard<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151231/5b5ab499/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6451ee8093c9cedc94f6c813b4dde2c5?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Proposal] Protocols on Steroids</strong> from <string>Kevin Ballard</string> &lt;kevin at sb.org&gt;<p>December 31, 2015 at 06:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Skimming it again, here&#39;s some brief commentary on your other suggestions:<br></p><p>On Wed, Dec 30, 2015, at 02:50 PM, Howard Lovatt via swift-evolution wrote:<br>&gt;  1.

Allow covariant return types including for generic types<br></p><p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by this. The return type of a function is<br>already covariant. As for generics, I&#39;m not sure how the compiler is<br>supposed to know whether any other type U is a subtype of a generic type<br>T. In theory, we could modify Swift to allow you to say something like<br></p><p>func foo&lt;T: AnyObject, U: T&gt;(_: T.Type, _ x: U) -&gt; T {    return x }<br></p><p>(right now this fails on the `U: T` because it doesn&#39;t know that T is a<br>class type despite the previous bound of `T: AnyObject`)<br></p><p>But I can&#39;t think of where this would actually be useful in practice to<br>do (which may be why Swift doesn&#39;t bother to support it).<br></p><p>&gt;  1. Treat Self as a shorthand for the type name; in particular as<br>&gt;     though there was an extra genetic type, `Type&lt;Self: Type&gt;` and<br>&gt;     everywhere `Self` appeared in the body the compiler substitutes<br>&gt;     `Type`<br></p><p>I suspect this has been proposed before; I know I filed a radar for this<br>a long time ago. Although just to be clear, what I&#39;m thinking of is<br>simply the ability to use the token `Self` anywhere inside a type<br>definition as a convenient way to refer to the enclosing type, and not<br>actually changing anything about generics or type parameters.<br></p><p>&gt;  1. Allow `GenericTypeName.dynamicType` to return the metatype of a<br>&gt;     generic type<br></p><p>You can already say `T.self.dynamicType` to get the metatype.<br></p><p>&gt;  1. Treat typealias as introducing a generic type parameter that is<br>&gt;     not part of the type&#39;s type signature (or whatever it is<br>&gt;     renamed to)<br></p><p>I have no idea what you mean by this. How can you have a type parameter<br>that&#39;s not part of the type parameters list?<br></p><p>&gt;  1. Allow implementations in protocols as well as in extensions to<br>&gt;     protocols (I think this is on the cards already)<br></p><p>This sounds not-unreasonable. Has it been proposed before?<br></p><p>&gt;  1. Allow default stored properties and default inits in protocol, see<br>&gt;     `Holder` example below<br></p><p>Your example below implies the addition of struct inheritance, which<br>isn&#39;t really something we can support. Inheritance implies a subtyping<br>relationship, but you cannot have some struct Foo be a subtype of some<br>other struct Bar if for no other reason than the fact that structs are<br>value types and so you cannot possibly substitute a value of type Foo in<br>any code that expects a Bar as it would be the wrong size. You could add<br>implicit coercions that _slice_ the value (similar to C++), but that&#39;s a<br>pretty nasty route to go down. Note that your example already violates<br>this; you can&#39;t call `printout(holder)` because a Holder&lt;Int&gt; is not the<br>same size as as Holder&lt;Any&gt;. Besides, you can already define that<br>function pretty easily with generics as `func printout&lt;T&gt;(value:<br>Holder&lt;T&gt;)`. I feel like all you&#39;re really trying to accomplish here is<br>the removal of generics from functions (since this looks awfully similar<br>to what you&#39;d get with covariant mutable Arrays).<br></p><p>I suspect that what you really want is just a way to define common<br>behavior that&#39;s included in other structs, which is basically protocols<br>except you want to add stored properties too. So in a sense what you<br>really want is just a way to &quot;embed&quot; one struct in another (a stored<br>property containing a struct is a form of embedding, but I&#39;m talking<br>here about embedding all its members directly without going through a<br>stored property). This is not a true subtyping relationship (see<br>previous paragraph) but accomplishes what you want.<br></p><p>If you want to propose such a thing, I&#39;d suggest maybe defining it like<br></p><p>struct HolderInt: embeds DefaultHolder&lt;Int&gt; {    // ... }<br></p><p>to make it clear that this isn&#39;t a subtyping thing (you could make<br>&quot;embeds&quot; into a member, but that becomes a little confusing then when<br>you realize that the new struct acquires all of the embedded structs<br>methods/properties).<br></p><p>That said, a fair amount of thought would have to go into doing this and<br>making sure it&#39;s compatible with any future changes that we want to make<br>to the language (it&#39;s definitely worth a proposal all on its own if you<br>really want to do it).<br></p><p>Of course, in the end your original suggestion of having a protocol with<br>stored properties still doesn&#39;t work, because it would be impossible to<br>declare protocol conformance for a type in an extension (which is a<br>pretty serious limitation). And I&#39;m not really sure what benefit you<br>have with this over the current approach of simply having to declare the<br>stored property in the actual struct.<br></p><p>&gt;  1. Disallow overload of a function with a generically typed argument<br>&gt;     with a function whose argument is derived from the generic type,<br>&gt;     must be an override.<br></p><p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by this. Can you elaborate? When you say<br>&quot;derived from the generic type&quot;, it makes me think you&#39;re talking about<br>something like<br></p><p>class Foo {    func foo&lt;T: SequenceType&gt;(x: T) }<br></p><p>class Bar : Foo {    func foo&lt;T: SequenceType&gt;(x: T.Generator) }<br></p><p>But I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;d want that second function to be marked<br>as an override; it&#39;s clearly _not_ an override, as it doesn&#39;t have the<br>same type! Note that all overridden functions can call super.func(), but<br>if you required the &quot;override&quot; keyword here you clearly can&#39;t call<br>super.foo() as the &quot;overridden&quot; function has a different type signature.<br></p><p>&gt;  1. `Equatable` and co would not be a special type, could have arrays<br>&gt;     of `Equatable`s<br></p><p>It&#39;s not a special type already, it&#39;s just a protocol. And as far as I<br>can tell, nothing that you&#39;ve described would allow you to to have an<br>array of type `[Equatable]`. I suspect you&#39;re thinking that protocol<br>type parameters + typealiases somehow being implicit type parameters<br>would do this, except the type `[Equatable]` still doesn&#39;t declare the<br>type. Or with the typealias thing did you actually intend to have<br>`Equatable` look something like `Equatable&lt;Self=T&gt;`, thus allowing you<br>to say `[Equatable&lt;Self=Int&gt;]`? But that doesn&#39;t actually work, because<br>if you know that Self is an Int, then you&#39;d just say `[Int]` instead.<br></p><p>An argument can be made for allowing one to specify typealiases on<br>existential protocol values, e.g. `GeneratorType&lt;Element=Int&gt;` (although<br>that would get pretty unwieldy when you try to figure out how to specify<br>a SequenceType or a CollectionType), but there&#39;s no sense in attempting<br>to do that for Self, because if you set Self=T then you should just use<br>a T directly instead of an existential protocol value.<br></p><p>&gt;  1. No need for `AnyXXX` types, the protocol does this directly<br></p><p>No it doesn&#39;t. Barring the above-mentioned issues with specifying<br>typealiases on existential protocol values, types like AnySequence also<br>erase a lot of the specifics of the typealias. Even with your suggested<br>changes, there&#39;d be no way to say &quot;SequenceType&lt;Element=Int&gt;&quot; because<br>that leaves the Generator and SubSequence types undefined, which means<br>you can&#39;t actually do much at all with the existential protocol value.<br>But AnySequence only has a parameter for the element type, the details<br>of the generator and subsequence are erased.<br></p><p>&gt;  1. No need for `CollectionType` and `Array`, `Array` would become a<br>&gt;     `protocol` and a `struct`<br></p><p>What? That doesn&#39;t make any sense. Even with your struct inheritance<br>idea, Array can&#39;t possibly be the &quot;base&quot; for all collections. If you<br>want a collection with the stored properties and behavior of Array, you<br>just use an Array! The whole point of using other collections is because<br>you want different behavior.<br></p><p>-Kevin Ballard<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151231/5abe474d/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
