In this case, you seem to be asking for a refactoring engine that would be driven by source annotations, which sounds basically pointless except perhaps as a vehicle for extremely lazy research papers.<br></p><p>I think a refactoring engine would be very welcome in the Swift repository.  However, the technical design of its interface is a detail that should be decided according to the needs of its implementers and users rather than by random people making comments on mailing lists.  If you are interested in contributing to that effort, that’s great, but you will need to write some code.  Also, that discussion should occur on the development lists rather than the evolution list, since it’s fundamentally a question of tools implementation rather than language design.<br></p><p>John.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Jacob<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Tue, Dec 29, 2015 at 10:07 AM, Amir Michail via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; Source to source transformations are part of a developer’s job, don’t need a GUI, and can be done more easily and accurately by the Swift compiler.
