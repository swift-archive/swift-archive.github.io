I’m here to propose predefining a macro __swift__ when C code is compiled with Swift. We’ve gotten a few requests for it in the past and haven’t done it so that people don’t write header files that arbitrarily restrict features when used from Swift, or check for &quot;Swift&quot; when they really should be checking for modules support, or Objective-C mode, or nullability support. (Or worse, they guard code under __swift__ and then don’t ever test it, leading to failures to import the module from Swift.)<br></p><p>However, with Swift 3, it’s now become important for Objective-C authors to be able to control how their APIs look in modern Swift 3 without disrupting existing clients on Swift 2.3. (Or just because Swift 3 style looks out-of-place in Swift 2.3.) The most obvious way to do this would be to define a macro that has the Swift version in it. For Swift version X.Y.Z, we could use something like<br></p><p>-D__swift__=XYYZZ<br></p><p>e.g.<br></p><p>-D__swift__=30001<br></p><p>for Swift 3.0.1.<br></p><p>This is option (1). Option (2) would be to define __swift__ as a predicate that took version numbers:<br></p><p>-D__swift__(MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH)=(MAJOR * 10000 + MINOR * 100 + PATCH &lt;= XYYZZ)<br>-D__swift__(MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH)=(MAJOR * 10000 + MINOR * 100 + PATCH &lt;= 30001)<br></p><p>For completeness’ sake, option (3) would be to define a single macro __SWIFT3__, defined to 1. Clients can test for the presence or absence of this macro. I don’t like this option because (a) Swift 4 will also need to define __SWIFT3__, because it shouldn’t have the “old” behavior, and (b) we might very well want something like this again in the future; will we also define __SWIFT4__?<br></p><p>(Why __swift__ and not __SWIFT__? By analogy with __cplusplus [sic] and __clang__, although not __STDC__ or <br>__STDC_VERSION__. I don’t actually have a strong opinion here.)<br></p><p>Thoughts?<br>Jordan<br></p><p>P.S.
