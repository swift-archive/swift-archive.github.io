Being a<br>&gt; non-mutating method it should clearly be e.g. droppingFirst()<br>&gt; according to the API Naming Guidelines.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Like many `Sequence` and `Collection` operations, `dropFirst()` is a<br>&gt; result of the &quot;term of art&quot; exception, which is implied by the &quot;Use<br>&gt; Terminology Well&quot; section of the API Guidelines:<br>&gt; &lt;https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/#use-terminology-well&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Many languages use `dropWhatever` or `drop_whatever` for operations<br>&gt; which return some sort of list with some of its leading or trailing<br>&gt; elements removed. For instance:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; * Ruby (which I happen to have in Dash) has `drop(n)` and `drop_while` methods.<br>&gt; * Haskell has `drop n`, `dropWhile`, and `dropWhileEnd` functions.<br>&gt; * Scala has a `drop(n)` method.<br>&gt; * R has a `dropFirst` function.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The standard library has chosen to break its usual patterns in order to maintain consistency with languages like these.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Personally, I believe the term of art exception has been misapplied in<br>&gt; this area of the language; the precedents are not very strong, and the<br>&gt; resulting APIs form a patchwork of inconsistent names rather than a<br>&gt; coherent family. The term of art exception increases the clarity of<br>&gt; calls like `map` and `filter` where the names are truly universal, but<br>&gt; it impedes the clarity of the whole family of<br>&gt; `first`/`prefix`/`suffix`/`last` calls, and the names should be<br>&gt; revisited and rationalized. But that hasn&#39;t happened yet.<br></p><p>I agree that we need to revisit this area. Even filter can potentially<br>be improved upon.  The polarity of its closure is far from obvious even<br>if you know the terms of art.<br></p><p>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
