That parameter should have a default value which just traps.  That way the default behavior is to trap when a key is repeated, but it can still be overridden with a more appropriate behavior for the situation (e.g. keeping the first value, keeping the last, averaging them, etc…)<br></p><p>That said, I would still also like to see the functionality of mapValues (whatever it ends up being called) in the standard library.  It easily applies to 80-90% of my use cases, and allowing re-mapping of keys adds a lot of complexity which must be carefully considered (there is a lot more which can go wrong).  As swift is a practical language, it would be nice to have a quick and foolproof way to do this common task.<br></p><p>Thanks,<br>Jon<br></p><p><br>&gt; on Tue Apr 12 2016, Jonathan Hull &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; I would really like to see something like the following added to the standard<br>&gt; &gt; library:<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; extension Dictionary {<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; func mapValues&lt;U&gt;(transform:(Key,Value)-&gt;U)-&gt;[Key:U] {<br>&gt; &gt; var output:[Key:U] = [:]<br>&gt; &gt; for (k,v) in self {<br>&gt; &gt; output[k] = transform(k,v)<br>&gt; &gt; }<br>&gt; &gt; return output<br>&gt; &gt; }<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; }<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; It comes up enough that I have had to add it to pretty much every one of my<br>&gt; &gt; projects. I also don’t feel comfortable adding it to my frameworks, since I<br>&gt; &gt; figure a lot of people are also adding something like this to their projects,<br>&gt; &gt; and I don’t want to cause a conflict with their version. Prime candidate for the<br>&gt; &gt; standard library.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I like calling it ‘mapValues&#39; as opposed to providing an override for map, since<br>&gt; &gt; it makes the specific behavior more clear. I would expect ‘map&#39; to possibly map<br>&gt; &gt; the keys as well (though there are issues where the new keys overlap). I suppose<br>&gt; &gt; you could just have a bunch of overrides for map if the compiler becomes good<br>&gt; &gt; enough at differentiating return types: (Value)-&gt;(Value), (Key,Value)-&gt;Value,<br>&gt; &gt; (Key, Value)-&gt;(Key,Value)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I agree that we need a way to do this, and was surprised when what I<br>&gt; tried didn&#39;t work.  This should work:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;   Dictionary(d.lazy.map { (k, v) in (k, transform(v)) })<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We should have a proposal that makes the constructor work* if we don&#39;t<br>&gt; already have one.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m inclined against building specialized variants of basic algorithms<br>&gt; into particular collections, though.  Could be talked out of it if the<br>&gt; use-case is strong enough.<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160417/54353e0b/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
