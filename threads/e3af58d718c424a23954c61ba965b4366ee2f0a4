I strongly agains it.<br></p><p>But the proposal is for &quot;explicit&quot; &quot;with&quot;, where it is clear what <br>method/property belongs to target instance, and which don&#39;t. So most of <br>your notes regarding problems with &quot;with&quot; are not related to &quot;external&quot; <br>with, but to &quot;internal&quot; &quot;with&quot;, that was not even introduced by the proposal.<br></p><p>As for your notes regarding implicit &quot;self.&quot; when you writing code inside <br>class. No, you not always know what exact methods is in class and what is <br>external functions: in case you are extending some class from some library <br>or inherit from such class. And I think we actually have this problem when <br>writing class code : I believe we need &quot;explicit&quot; marker that some <br>method/property belongs to our class. Personally I think &quot;self.&quot; should be <br>necessarily to use in our code.<br></p><p> &gt;Even if we use .bar() instead of just bar() when calling from within.....<br></p><p>It is not about saving the space in code. It is about more readable and (I <br>insist) more stable(with less errors) code.<br></p><p>Let&#39;s get your example with br. Let&#39;s say you have additionally bt <br>instance. Take into account code-completion feature of your editor. Take <br>into account copy-paste errors(when you copy code of br, wants to use for bt).<br></p><p>br = ..<br>br.one = ..<br>br.two = ...<br>br.three = ...<br>some1 = br.four()<br></p><p>bt = ..<br>bt.one = ..<br>bt.two = ...<br>br.three = ...<br>some2 = bt.four()<br></p><p>oops.. &quot;br.three = ...&quot; instead of &quot;bt.three&quot;<br></p><p>but let&#39;s compare :<br></p><p>with br {<br>   .one = ..<br>   .two = ...<br>   .three = ...<br>   some1 = .four()<br>}<br></p><p>with bt {<br>   .one = ..<br>   .two = ...<br>   .three = ...<br>   some2 = .four()<br>}<br></p><p>Much less possibilities for copy-paste errors. Wrong code completion <br>suggestion(by editor) can not produce error. It is explicit and clear, it <br>has much less noise in code. IMO it just better in any ways.<br></p><p><br> &gt; IMHO, saving sourecode-bits is not everything; readable code is<br> &gt; everything.
