With common BigInts, you lose performance.<br>- Crypto is not possible to be implemented securely in pure Swift 2.<br>  The language lacks annotations to prevent compiler optimisations on a fine-grained level.<br>  i.e. timing invariance of comparisons etc is not guaranteed / no control about caching behaviour.<br>  Need to do that in Assembly to be safe against side channel attacks.<br>  Even with Assembly, you may lose to CPU microcode optimisations.

One goal of this effort is to enable operations on mixed integer types, which as you can see is partially completed.  In-place arithmetic (anInt32 += aUInt64) is next.  Another important goal is to make the integer protocols actually useful for writing generic code, instead of what they are today: implementation artifacts used only for code sharing.  As another litmus test of the usefulness of the resulting protocols, the plan is to implement BigInt in terms of the generic operations defined on integers, and make BigInt itself conform to those protocols.<br></p><p>Using GMP would probably result in faster code, and after the protocols have proven themselves adequate for mixed-width/arbitrary-precision integer integer implementation, it might make sense to put a version of the same APIs based on GMP into the standard library.<br></p><p>-Dave<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151214/3c8b27b2/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
