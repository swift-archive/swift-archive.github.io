Prior to this, using NSError, I could just look at the relevant properties of the error if I needed to see what type it was. Network errors had different codes from CloudKit errors, POSIX errors were underlying FileManager errors. A bit complex due to the undocumented nature of so many of these errors, but I could ignore any aspect of the error I didn’t care about. Now, however, it seems I must always care about what types of errors come out of various methods, as I’ll need to cast to the appropriate types to get useful information. For example, how would you handle the CloudKit errors I mentioned before? It seems to me like I would need to, at the point where I need to extract useful information, do a switch on various casts. First, try casting to CKError, then to CocoaError (?), and then likely produce a fatalError if there’s an unexpected type. Or is Error guaranteed to always cast to something useful? I’ve read the proposal a few times now and it looks like a lot of casting is going to be required, I’m mostly curious about the recommended patterns, especially for asynchronous calls that don’t go through throw/catch. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Jon<br></p><p><br>&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 5:36 PM, Douglas Gregor &lt;dgregor at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 2:19 PM, Jon Shier &lt;jon at jonshier.com &lt;mailto:jon at jonshier.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	Thanks Doug. I missed the rename, as earlier points still referred to ErrorProtocol. In regards to the CloudKit errors, I appreciate the strongly typed CKError, but why not have the methods return that type directly?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Generally speaking, Cocoa only uses NSError—not specific subclasses or NSError or other error types—because errors can occur at many different places in the stack and be propagated up. A CloudKit operation could fail because of some problem detected in a different error domain—say, the general Cocoa error domain or URLError domain—and that non-CloudKit error would get passed through immediately. So, if you were assuming that every error you get here had to be in the CloudKit error domain, I believe your code was already incorrect. It is *possible* that CloudKit translates/wraps all other errors, but that would be odd for a Cocoa framework.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Every usage of these methods is going to require such a cast, so why require it in the first place? I don’t understand what advantage erasing the strongly type error that was just created has when the developer will just have to bring it right back. Or is this just a first implementation?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; There was never a strongly-typed error, and in most Cocoa cases there shouldn’t be one because NSError covers all error domains, by design.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	- Doug<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Jon<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 4:20 PM, Douglas Gregor &lt;dgregor at apple.com &lt;mailto:dgregor at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 10:30 AM, Jon Shier via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	I’m not sure where to put such feedback, but the ErrorProtocol to Error rename that accompanied the implementation of this proposal is very, very painful. It completely eliminates the very useful ability to embed an associated Error type inside other types, as those types now conflict with the protocol. Also, was this rename accompanied by an evolution proposal? It seems like the change was just made when this proposal was implemented.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The rename was part of the proposal, in bullet #5 of the proposed solution (which, amusing, pastes as bullet #1 below):<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Rename ErrorProtocol to Error: once we&#39;ve completed the bridging story, Error becomes the primary way to work with error types in Swift, and the value type to which NSError is bridged:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; func handleError(_ error: Error, userInteractionPermitted: Bool)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	Also, the adoption of this proposal by the Cocoa(Touch) frameworks as seen in Xcode 8 beta 4 has made asynchronous error handling quite a bit more arduous. For example, the CKDatabase method fetch(withRecordID recordID: CKRecordID, completionHandler: (CKRecord?, Error?) -&gt; Void) returns an `Error` now, meaning I have to cast to the specific `CKError` type to get useful information out of it. Is this just an unfortunate first effort that will be fixed, or is this the expected form of these sorts of APIs after this proposal?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Prior to this proposal, you would have had to check the domain against CKErrorDomain anyway to determine whether you’re looking at a CloudKit error (vs. some other error that is passing through CloudKit), so error bridging shouldn’t actually be adding any work here—although it might be making explicit work that was already done or should have been done. Once you have casted to CKError, you now have typed accessors for information in the error:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; extension CKError {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   /// Retrieve partial error results associated by item ID.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   public var partialErrorsByItemID: [NSObject : Error]? {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     return userInfo[CKPartialErrorsByItemIDKey] as?

There is a one-to-one correspondence between domains and the new error types. For example, NSCocoaErrorDomain is represented by CocoaError, NSURLErrorDomain is URLError, etc.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; So previously you might have code that looks like<br>&gt; <br>&gt; func handleError(error: NSError) {<br>&gt;     switch error.domain {<br>&gt;     case NSCocoaErrorDomain where error.code == NSFileNoSuchFileError:<br>&gt;         let path = error.userInfo[NSFilePathErrorKey] as? String<br>&gt;         // handle error for path<br>&gt;     case NSURLErrorDomain where error.code == NSURLErrorTimedOut:<br>&gt;         let url = error.userInfo[NSURLErrorKey] as?

Prior to this, using NSError, I could just look at the relevant properties of the error if I needed to see what type it was. Network errors had different codes from CloudKit errors, POSIX errors were underlying FileManager errors. A bit complex due to the undocumented nature of so many of these errors, but I could ignore any aspect of the error I didn’t care about. Now, however, it seems I must always care about what types of errors come out of various methods, as I’ll need to cast to the appropriate types to get useful information. For example, how would you handle the CloudKit errors I mentioned before? It seems to me like I would need to, at the point where I need to extract useful information, do a switch on various casts. First, try casting to CKError, then to CocoaError (?), and then likely produce a fatalError if there’s an unexpected type. Or is Error guaranteed to always cast to something useful? I’ve read the proposal a few times now and it looks like a lot of casting is going to be required, I’m mostly curious about the recommended patterns, especially for asynchronous calls that don’t go through throw/catch. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Jon<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 5:36 PM, Douglas Gregor &lt;dgregor at apple.com &lt;mailto:dgregor at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 2:19 PM, Jon Shier &lt;jon at jonshier.com &lt;mailto:jon at jonshier.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks Doug. I missed the rename, as earlier points still referred to ErrorProtocol. In regards to the CloudKit errors, I appreciate the strongly typed CKError, but why not have the methods return that type directly?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Generally speaking, Cocoa only uses NSError—not specific subclasses or NSError or other error types—because errors can occur at many different places in the stack and be propagated up. A CloudKit operation could fail because of some problem detected in a different error domain—say, the general Cocoa error domain or URLError domain—and that non-CloudKit error would get passed through immediately. So, if you were assuming that every error you get here had to be in the CloudKit error domain, I believe your code was already incorrect. It is *possible* that CloudKit translates/wraps all other errors, but that would be odd for a Cocoa framework.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Every usage of these methods is going to require such a cast, so why require it in the first place? I don’t understand what advantage erasing the strongly type error that was just created has when the developer will just have to bring it right back. Or is this just a first implementation?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; There was never a strongly-typed error, and in most Cocoa cases there shouldn’t be one because NSError covers all error domains, by design.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; - Doug<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jon<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 4:20 PM, Douglas Gregor &lt;dgregor at apple.com &lt;mailto:dgregor at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 10:30 AM, Jon Shier via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I’m not sure where to put such feedback, but the ErrorProtocol to Error rename that accompanied the implementation of this proposal is very, very painful. It completely eliminates the very useful ability to embed an associated Error type inside other types, as those types now conflict with the protocol. Also, was this rename accompanied by an evolution proposal? It seems like the change was just made when this proposal was implemented.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The rename was part of the proposal, in bullet #5 of the proposed solution (which, amusing, pastes as bullet #1 below):<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rename ErrorProtocol to Error: once we&#39;ve completed the bridging story, Error becomes the primary way to work with error types in Swift, and the value type to which NSError is bridged:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; func handleError(_ error: Error, userInteractionPermitted: Bool)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, the adoption of this proposal by the Cocoa(Touch) frameworks as seen in Xcode 8 beta 4 has made asynchronous error handling quite a bit more arduous. For example, the CKDatabase method fetch(withRecordID recordID: CKRecordID, completionHandler: (CKRecord?, Error?) -&gt; Void) returns an `Error` now, meaning I have to cast to the specific `CKError` type to get useful information out of it. Is this just an unfortunate first effort that will be fixed, or is this the expected form of these sorts of APIs after this proposal?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Prior to this proposal, you would have had to check the domain against CKErrorDomain anyway to determine whether you’re looking at a CloudKit error (vs. some other error that is passing through CloudKit), so error bridging shouldn’t actually be adding any work here—although it might be making explicit work that was already done or should have been done. Once you have casted to CKError, you now have typed accessors for information in the error:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extension CKError {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   /// Retrieve partial error results associated by item ID.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   public var partialErrorsByItemID: [NSObject : Error]? {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     return userInfo[CKPartialErrorsByItemIDKey] as?

There is a one-to-one correspondence between domains and the<br>&gt;&gt; new error types. For example, NSCocoaErrorDomain is represented by<br>&gt;&gt; CocoaError, NSURLErrorDomain is URLError, etc.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; So previously you might have code that looks like<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; func handleError(error: NSError) {<br>&gt;&gt;     switch error.domain {<br>&gt;&gt;     case NSCocoaErrorDomain where error.code ==<br>&gt;&gt;     NSFileNoSuchFileError:<br>&gt;&gt;         let path = error.userInfo[NSFilePathErrorKey] as?

Prior to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; this, using NSError, I could just look at the relevant properties of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; the error if I needed to see what type it was. Network errors had<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; different codes from CloudKit errors, POSIX errors were underlying<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; FileManager errors. A bit complex due to the undocumented nature of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; so many of these errors, but I could ignore any aspect of the error<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn’t care about. Now, however, it seems I must always care about<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; what types of errors come out of various methods, as I’ll need to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; cast to the appropriate types to get useful information. For<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; example, how would you handle the CloudKit errors I mentioned<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; before? It seems to me like I would need to, at the point where I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; need to extract useful information, do a switch on various casts.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; First, try casting to CKError, then to CocoaError (?), and then<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; likely produce a fatalError if there’s an unexpected type. Or is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Error guaranteed to always cast to something useful? I’ve read the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; proposal a few times now and it looks like a lot of casting is going<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; to be required, I’m mostly curious about the recommended patterns,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; especially for asynchronous calls that don’t go through throw/catch.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Jon<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 5:36 PM, Douglas Gregor &lt;dgregor at apple.com&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 2:19 PM, Jon Shier &lt;jon at jonshier.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks Doug. I missed the rename, as earlier points still referred<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to ErrorProtocol. In regards to the CloudKit errors, I appreciate<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the strongly typed CKError, but why not have the methods return<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that type directly?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Generally speaking, Cocoa only uses NSError—not specific subclasses<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or NSError or other error types—because errors can occur at many<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different places in the stack and be propagated up. A CloudKit<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; operation could fail because of some problem detected in a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; different error domain—say, the general Cocoa error domain or<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; URLError domain—and that non-CloudKit error would get passed<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; through immediately. So, if you were assuming that every error you<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get here had to be in the CloudKit error domain, I believe your<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; code was already incorrect. It is *possible* that CloudKit<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; translates/wraps all other errors, but that would be odd for a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cocoa framework.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Every usage of these methods is going to require such a cast, so<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; why require it in the first place? I don’t understand what<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; advantage erasing the strongly type error that was just created<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has when the developer will just have to bring it right back. Or<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is this just a first implementation?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There was never a strongly-typed error, and in most Cocoa cases<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there shouldn’t be one because NSError covers all error domains, by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; design.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Doug<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jon<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 4:20 PM, Douglas Gregor &lt;dgregor at apple.com&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 10:30 AM, Jon Shier via swift-evolution &lt;swift-<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I’m not sure where to put such feedback, but the ErrorProtocol<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to Error rename that accompanied the implementation of this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; proposal is very, very painful. It completely eliminates the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very useful ability to embed an associated Error type inside<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other types, as those types now conflict with the protocol.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, was this rename accompanied by an evolution proposal? It<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seems like the change was just made when this proposal was<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; implemented.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The rename was part of the proposal, in bullet #5 of the proposed<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solution (which, amusing, pastes as bullet #1 below):<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  1. Rename ErrorProtocol to Error: once we&#39;ve completed the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     bridging story, Error becomes the primary way to work with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     error types in Swift, and the value type to which NSError is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     bridged:<br></p><p><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; func handleError(_ error: Error, userInteractionPermitted: Bool)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, the adoption of this proposal by the Cocoa(Touch)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; frameworks as seen in Xcode 8 beta 4 has made asynchronous error<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; handling quite a bit more arduous. For example, the CKDatabase<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; method fetch(withRecordID recordID: CKRecordID,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; completionHandler: (CKRecord?, Error?) -&gt; Void) returns an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `Error` now, meaning I have to cast to the specific `CKError`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type to get useful information out of it. Is this just an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unfortunate first effort that will be fixed, or is this the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expected form of these sorts of APIs after this proposal?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Prior to this proposal, you would have had to check the domain<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; against CKErrorDomain anyway to determine whether you’re looking<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at a CloudKit error (vs. some other error that is passing through<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CloudKit), so error bridging shouldn’t actually be adding any<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work here—although it might be making explicit work that was<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; already done or should have been done. Once you have casted to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CKError, you now have typed accessors for information in the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; error:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extension CKError {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   /// Retrieve partial error results associated by item ID.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   public var partialErrorsByItemID: [NSObject : Error]? {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     return userInfo[CKPartialErrorsByItemIDKey] as?

There is a one-to-one correspondence between domains and the new error types. For example, NSCocoaErrorDomain is represented by CocoaError, NSURLErrorDomain is URLError, etc.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; So previously you might have code that looks like<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; func handleError(error: NSError) {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     switch error.domain {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     case NSCocoaErrorDomain where error.code == NSFileNoSuchFileError:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         let path = error.userInfo[NSFilePathErrorKey] as?

Prior to this, using NSError, I could just look at the relevant properties of the error if I needed to see what type it was. Network errors had different codes from CloudKit errors, POSIX errors were underlying FileManager errors. A bit complex due to the undocumented nature of so many of these errors, but I could ignore any aspect of the error I didn’t care about. Now, however, it seems I must always care about what types of errors come out of various methods, as I’ll need to cast to the appropriate types to get useful information. For example, how would you handle the CloudKit errors I mentioned before? It seems to me like I would need to, at the point where I need to extract useful information, do a switch on various casts. First, try casting to CKError, then to CocoaError (?), and then likely produce a fatalError if there’s an unexpected type. Or is Error guaranteed to always cast to something useful? I’ve read the proposal a few times now and it looks like a lot of casting is going to be required, I’m mostly curious about the recommended patterns, especially for asynchronous calls that don’t go through throw/catch. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jon<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 5:36 PM, Douglas Gregor &lt;dgregor at apple.com &lt;mailto:dgregor at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 2:19 PM, Jon Shier &lt;jon at jonshier.com &lt;mailto:jon at jonshier.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks Doug. I missed the rename, as earlier points still referred to ErrorProtocol. In regards to the CloudKit errors, I appreciate the strongly typed CKError, but why not have the methods return that type directly?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Generally speaking, Cocoa only uses NSError—not specific subclasses or NSError or other error types—because errors can occur at many different places in the stack and be propagated up. A CloudKit operation could fail because of some problem detected in a different error domain—say, the general Cocoa error domain or URLError domain—and that non-CloudKit error would get passed through immediately. So, if you were assuming that every error you get here had to be in the CloudKit error domain, I believe your code was already incorrect. It is *possible* that CloudKit translates/wraps all other errors, but that would be odd for a Cocoa framework.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Every usage of these methods is going to require such a cast, so why require it in the first place? I don’t understand what advantage erasing the strongly type error that was just created has when the developer will just have to bring it right back. Or is this just a first implementation?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There was never a strongly-typed error, and in most Cocoa cases there shouldn’t be one because NSError covers all error domains, by design.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Doug<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jon<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 4:20 PM, Douglas Gregor &lt;dgregor at apple.com &lt;mailto:dgregor at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 2, 2016, at 10:30 AM, Jon Shier via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I’m not sure where to put such feedback, but the ErrorProtocol to Error rename that accompanied the implementation of this proposal is very, very painful. It completely eliminates the very useful ability to embed an associated Error type inside other types, as those types now conflict with the protocol. Also, was this rename accompanied by an evolution proposal? It seems like the change was just made when this proposal was implemented.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The rename was part of the proposal, in bullet #5 of the proposed solution (which, amusing, pastes as bullet #1 below):<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rename ErrorProtocol to Error: once we&#39;ve completed the bridging story, Error becomes the primary way to work with error types in Swift, and the value type to which NSError is bridged:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; func handleError(_ error: Error, userInteractionPermitted: Bool)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, the adoption of this proposal by the Cocoa(Touch) frameworks as seen in Xcode 8 beta 4 has made asynchronous error handling quite a bit more arduous. For example, the CKDatabase method fetch(withRecordID recordID: CKRecordID, completionHandler: (CKRecord?, Error?) -&gt; Void) returns an `Error` now, meaning I have to cast to the specific `CKError` type to get useful information out of it. Is this just an unfortunate first effort that will be fixed, or is this the expected form of these sorts of APIs after this proposal?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Prior to this proposal, you would have had to check the domain against CKErrorDomain anyway to determine whether you’re looking at a CloudKit error (vs. some other error that is passing through CloudKit), so error bridging shouldn’t actually be adding any work here—although it might be making explicit work that was already done or should have been done. Once you have casted to CKError, you now have typed accessors for information in the error:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extension CKError {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   /// Retrieve partial error results associated by item ID.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   public var partialErrorsByItemID: [NSObject : Error]? {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     return userInfo[CKPartialErrorsByItemIDKey] as?

However, now I’m looking for some guidance for framework developers. While the proposal laid out the system types would wrap imported Objective-C errors, I don’t see anything for the desired patters for Swift native errors. For instance, in Alamofire we currently either pass through the NSErrors we receive from underlying frameworks or generate our own, usually in our own domain, with unique error codes and such. I can see my way to translating most of these directly to an AFError type that conforms to Error, but some of them require associated values (e.g. the content type validation error needs to know the expected and actual content types). In these cases I’m having a hard time see how these things should be stored, especially when only some cases need this data. Of course, I’m away of the LocalizedError protocol, but that doesn’t seem applicable here, as I’m mostly wondering about storage. Rather than creating types similar to the system error types, perhaps a basic enum based error would work, where only the cases that need it capture values? I’m mostly curious what the anticipated pattern was here.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Jon<br></p><p>&gt; On Aug 6, 2016, at 1:15 AM, Kevin Ballard via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Aug 5, 2016, at 7:36 PM, Erica Sadun &lt;erica at ericasadun.com &lt;mailto:erica at ericasadun.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Aug 5, 2016, at 8:10 PM, Kevin Ballard &lt;kevin at sb.org &lt;mailto:kevin at sb.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 5, 2016, at 5:16 PM, Erica Sadun &lt;erica at ericasadun.com &lt;mailto:erica at ericasadun.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 5, 2016, at 4:19 PM, Douglas Gregor via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 5, 2016, at 12:59 PM, Kevin Ballard via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If all you want to do is get the localized description, then you can just say `(error as NSError).localizedDescription`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just ‘error.localizedDescription’ works now.

However, now I’m looking for some guidance for framework developers. While the proposal laid out the system types would wrap imported Objective-C errors, I don’t see anything for the desired patters for Swift native errors. For instance, in Alamofire we currently either pass through the NSErrors we receive from underlying frameworks or generate our own, usually in our own domain, with unique error codes and such. I can see my way to translating most of these directly to an AFError type that conforms to Error, but some of them require associated values (e.g. the content type validation error needs to know the expected and actual content types). In these cases I’m having a hard time see how these things should be stored, especially when only some cases need this data. Of course, I’m away of the LocalizedError protocol, but that doesn’t seem applicable here, as I’m mostly wondering about storage. Rather than creating types similar to the system error types, perhaps a basic enum based error would work, where only the cases that need it capture values? I’m mostly curious what the anticipated pattern was here.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Jon<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Aug 6, 2016, at 1:15 AM, Kevin Ballard via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 5, 2016, at 7:36 PM, Erica Sadun &lt;erica at ericasadun.com &lt;mailto:erica at ericasadun.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 5, 2016, at 8:10 PM, Kevin Ballard &lt;kevin at sb.org &lt;mailto:kevin at sb.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 5, 2016, at 5:16 PM, Erica Sadun &lt;erica at ericasadun.com &lt;mailto:erica at ericasadun.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 5, 2016, at 4:19 PM, Douglas Gregor via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Aug 5, 2016, at 12:59 PM, Kevin Ballard via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If all you want to do is get the localized description, then you can just say `(error as NSError).localizedDescription`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just ‘error.localizedDescription’ works now.

However, since Alamofire wraps the underlying networking frameworks there’s a need to return the errors returned from them as well, which are now returned as Error. In order to let these errors be returned alongside Alamofire’s errors we’d either have to get rid of the generic error and just use Error or wrap all errors in our error type. So far the least painful method seems to be just getting rid of the generic error and returning Error for everything. That way users will use the same logic they would have had to use anyway and can also provide their own error wrapper if they want.

However, since Alamofire wraps the underlying networking frameworks there’s a need to return the errors returned from them as well, which are now returned as Error. In order to let these errors be returned alongside Alamofire’s errors we’d either have to get rid of the generic error and just use Error or wrap all errors in our error type. So far the least painful method seems to be just getting rid of the generic error and returning Error for everything. That way users will use the same logic they would have had to use anyway and can also provide their own error wrapper if they want.

This isn’t about some other type named Error being usable, but about our doubly generic Result and other types being usable with Error as the generic error type. If we have Result defined as:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; public enum Result&lt;Value, ErrorType: Error&gt; {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     case success(Value)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     case failure(ErrorType)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; then attempting to create the type Result&lt;Whatever, Error&gt; results in the error message I posted. For methods that previously returned Result&lt;Whatever, NSError&gt;, where the NSError is either a system error or an Alamofire one, this is something of a problem. Of course, removing the generic error type fixes this but may have an undesirable usability impact, as making Result double generic was the primary reason behind the quick upgrade between Alamofire 2 and 3. I think it’s less of a problem now, as having to enumerate all of the different expected error types is how user’s are supposed to interact with Error in the first place, but at the time it wasn’t desirable to try and force everything through ErrorProtocol for that reason. Perhaps this is a good compromise, where instead of returning all NSErrors from the framework and allowing consumers to add their own to the mix we’ll just create our own AFError type (whether enum or struct) and then anything coming back will have to be checked for that type in addition to the system types. From my testing it looks like users could still wrap everything coming in by capturing the underlying Error.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Still seems to be working well, unless I’m misunderstanding what you’re trying to do:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; import Foundation<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; enum Result&lt;Value, ErrorType: Error&gt; {<br>&gt;&gt;     case success(Value)<br>&gt;&gt;     case failure(ErrorType)<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; struct MyThing {<br>&gt;&gt;     enum Error: Swift.Error, LocalizedError {<br>&gt;&gt;         case doesNotCompute<br>&gt;&gt;         case imSorryDave<br>&gt;&gt;         case mustSterilize<br>&gt;&gt;         case irrelevant<br>&gt;&gt;         case endOfLine<br>&gt;&gt;         <br>&gt;&gt;         var failureReason: String? {<br>&gt;&gt;             switch self {<br>&gt;&gt;             case .doesNotCompute:<br>&gt;&gt;                 return &quot;Does Not Compute!
