I couldn’t find<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this documented anywhere, but I assume this is because sorting can<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happen in-place and it would be impossible to restore the array to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its original state without giving up performance. Correct me if I’m<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrong.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I’d like to propose that we let sort rethrow anyways, and leave the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; array in an intermediate state (where the elements are in an<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arbitrary order) when an error is thrown. As long as this is<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; properly documented, this shouldn’t lead to any confusion. Best of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all, it would allow sorted to rethrow as well in which there is no<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; room for confusion at all because it doesn’t mutate any of the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; user’s variables.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This sounds reasonable; worst case with in-place sorting is that the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; collection was sorted in one order, and is only partially sorted in a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new one, but the exception and your handling of it should be able to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; account for this.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It will require documentation to be clear that sorting methods should<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take care not to leave anything incomplete if a closure throws; most<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; algorithms should be fine since they usually just test the closure<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then swap two values afterwards (where necessary) so there’s nothing<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really to interrupt, but anything that uses some kind of buffering may<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need to be redesigned to ensure there’s a fallback to ensure no<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elements are ever lost.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ensuring that no elements are ever lost is not a particularly useful<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; goal, and not a constraint to which I would want to hold the standard<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; library.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; --<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Dave<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; --<br>&gt; Dave<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>Marking sort and sorted with rethrows</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>June  7, 2016 at 08:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jun 7, 2016, at 12:07 PM, Tim Vermeulen via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; True, but the cost of being able to restore the original ordering, when<br>&gt;&gt; that restoration may not be needed at all, is prohibitive.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What about simply restoring the elements, in no particular order?

I suppose you&#39;re trying to acknowledge that distinction when you say these cases are &quot;in the same ballpark&quot;, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s really a sustainable objection. There *are* sensible alternatives, like the early-terminating block pattern, to throwing sequences and perhaps even throwing collections:<br></p><p>	try database.withQuery(sql) { rows in<br>		for row in rows {<br>			// If fetching a row fails, this loop terminates early and `withQuery` throws<br>			…<br>		}<br>	}<br></p><p>But throwing operations on stuff-inside-a-collection? That&#39;s just part of the language, and making errors during sorting extraordinarily difficult to handle won&#39;t stop the errors from being possible.<br></p><p>* * *<br></p><p>I actually think there *is* a sensible way to define the behavior of a throwing `sort(_:)`: you treat the comparison as though it returned `false` and continue sorting. If there&#39;s any sort of stability to the errors being thrown by `isOrderedBefore`, this will end up behaving like a sort with unordered elements, much like an array of floating-point types with some NaNs in it.

My point is that<br>&gt; it seems inconsistent with the Swift approach to error-handling, and<br>&gt; that if you want to do these things, you may need to convince someone to<br>&gt; change that approach.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; With a fair bit of work, it might even be possible to allow it to throw *all* of the errors it encountered:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	// This is structured slightly strangely to ensure that, if Error is Never, then MultipleErrors&lt;Never&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	// is an empty enum (since all cases require a Never associated value), and thus (hopefully!) <br>&gt;&gt; 	// is itself a synonym for Never.<br>&gt;&gt; 	enum MultipleErrors&lt;Error: ErrorProtocol&gt;: ErrorProtocol {<br>&gt;&gt; 		case one (Error)<br>&gt;&gt; 		indirect case many (Error, ErrorList&lt;Error&gt;)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 		func appending(_ newError: Error) -&gt; MultipleErrors&lt;Error&gt; {<br>&gt;&gt; 			switch self {<br>&gt;&gt; 			case let .one(oldError):<br>&gt;&gt; 				return .many(oldError, .one(newError))<br>&gt;&gt; 			case let .many(firstError, restErrors):<br>&gt;&gt; 				return .many(firstError, restErrors.appending(newError))<br>&gt;&gt; 			}<br>&gt;&gt; 		}		<br>&gt;&gt; 	}<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	extension&lt;Error: ErrorProtocol&gt; Optional where Wrapped == MultipleErrors&lt;Error&gt; {<br>&gt;&gt; 		func appending(_ newError: Error) -&gt; MultipleErrors&lt;Error&gt;? {<br>&gt;&gt; 			switch self {<br>&gt;&gt; 			case .none:<br>&gt;&gt; 				return .some(.one(newError))<br>&gt;&gt; 			case .some(let errors):<br>&gt;&gt; 				return .some(errors.appending(newError))<br>&gt;&gt; 			}<br>&gt;&gt; 		}<br>&gt;&gt; 	}<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 	mutating func sort&lt;Error: ErrorProtocol&gt;(isOrderedBefore: (Element, Element) throws Error -&gt; Bool) throws MultipleErrors&lt;Error&gt; {<br>&gt;&gt; 		var errors: MultipleErrors&lt;Error&gt;?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 		func isOrderedBeforeWithUnorderedErrors(a: Element, b: Element) -&gt; Bool {<br>&gt;&gt; 			do {<br>&gt;&gt; 				return try isOrderedBefore(a, b)<br>&gt;&gt; 			}<br>&gt;&gt; 			catch {<br>&gt;&gt; 				errors = errors.appending(error)<br>&gt;&gt; 				return false<br>&gt;&gt; 			}<br>&gt;&gt; 		}<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 		// Do the actual sorting here.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; 		if errors = errors { throw errors }<br>&gt;&gt; 	 }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; IMO that would be a collosal waste of resources.  The only interesting<br>&gt; error is the first one.  This is notionally a sort that failed partway<br>&gt; through, and that we had no mechanism for interrupting.  The fact that<br>&gt; you have to continue sorting after that error is just an artifact of<br>&gt; language limitations.  Either we should reaffirm our current (implicit)<br>&gt; declaration that these kinds of use-cases are off the table for Swift<br>&gt; error handling, or the philosophy of Swift error-handling should change<br>&gt; to allow us to support stopping at the right time.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Dave<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160609/d5ea9a43/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d53b7c5f9b5f5557b9082face9b632a0?s=50"></div><header><strong>Marking sort and sorted with rethrows</strong> from <string>Dave Abrahams</string> &lt;dabrahams at apple.com&gt;<p>June  9, 2016 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>on Thu Jun 09 2016, John McCall &lt;rjmccall-AT-apple.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; On Jun 9, 2016, at 9:04 AM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; on Wed Jun 08 2016, Brent Royal-Gordon &lt;brent-AT-architechies.com &lt;http://brent-at-architechies.com/&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sure that these ideas are consistent with the Swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; error-handling philosophy, which IIUC is very consciously designed *not*<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to support things like file- and database-backed Collections.  My<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understanding is that if you have something like that, you&#39;re not<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; supposed to throw errors on failure, but instead find some alternative<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; means of error handling.

It would be simple to change core library protocols to permit operations<br>&gt; to throw, but then every use of an algorithm over those protocols would throw.<br>&gt; This is the sort of problem that we address with &#39;rethrows&#39;, but that&#39;s quite a bit<br>&gt; more complex to apply to protocol conformances because you need to be more<br>&gt; specific about which requirements, exactly, will cause you to rethrow.  <br></p><p>Can you show an example?

IIUC, my original proposal for the<br>“rethrows” keyword would have solved these problems.  My understanding<br>was that it got no traction because solving them was considered an<br>anti-goal.<br></p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose you&#39;re trying to acknowledge that distinction when you say<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; these cases are &quot;in the same ballpark&quot;, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; really a sustainable objection.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Why not?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; There *are* sensible alternatives, like the early-terminating block<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; pattern, to throwing sequences and perhaps even throwing collections:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	try database.withQuery(sql) { rows in<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 		for row in rows {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 			// If fetching a row fails, this loop terminates early and `withQuery` throws<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 			…<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 		}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	}<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; That strategy doesn&#39;t begin to cover the use cases for collections.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Also, how is it supposed to work? You need a way to report a failure to<br>&gt;&gt; fetch the row—a way that doesn&#39;t involve throwing.  Who terminates the<br>&gt;&gt; loop, and how?  How does withQuery detect that the loop exited early?<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; But throwing operations on stuff-inside-a-collection? That&#39;s just part<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; of the language, and making errors during sorting extraordinarily<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult to handle won&#39;t stop the errors from being possible.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; There&#39;s basically no distinction.  If it&#39;s reasonable to have sort with<br>&gt;&gt; a throwing predicate, it&#39;s also reasonable to have a Comparable type<br>&gt;&gt; whose &lt; operator throws, and it&#39;s reasonable to use the sort overload<br>&gt;&gt; that takes no explicit predicate, and now you have a Collection protocol<br>&gt;&gt; method that throws directly, rather than rethrowing.  IIUC from the<br>&gt;&gt; people who designed Swift error handling, if you find yourself doing<br>&gt;&gt; that, you&#39;ve done something wrong.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I actually think there *is* a sensible way to define the behavior of a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; throwing `sort(_:)`: you treat the comparison as though it returned<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; `false` and continue sorting. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If there&#39;s any sort of stability to the errors being thrown by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; `isOrderedBefore`, this will end up behaving like a sort with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; unordered elements, much like an array of floating-point types with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; some NaNs in it. You not be able to rethrow all of the errors<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; encountered during the sort—you&#39;d have to pick the first or last—but a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; representative error would probably cover the use cases here.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; As Dmitri pointed out, that predicate doesn&#39;t satisfy the requirements<br>&gt;&gt; for sorting.  It&#39;s quite possible that a predicate that doesn&#39;t satisfy<br>&gt;&gt; an algorithm&#39;s requirements causes the algorithm to do invalid indexing<br>&gt;&gt; or some other evil nonsense.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; You could implement this with today&#39;s Swift in terms of our existing `sort(_:)`:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	mutating func sort(isOrderedBefore: (Element, Element) throws -&gt; Bool) throws {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 		var lastError: Error?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 		sort {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 			do {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 				return try isOrderedBefore($0, $1)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 			}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 			catch {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 				lastError = error<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 				return false<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 			}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 		}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 		if lastError = lastError { throw lastError }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	}<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Aside from the problems mentioned above, this is extremely inefficient<br>&gt;&gt; if the collection is large and backed a resource that fails slowly, such<br>&gt;&gt; as a network connection with retry and timeout.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think you could currently do one version with `rethrows`,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; because any way you do this, you&#39;ll need to save an error in a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; variable and `throw` it later, which I don&#39;t believe `rethrows` will<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; permit. <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Right.  That&#39;s a problem with the error-handling model.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; However, I saw a suggestion in the bottom type thread that, given both<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; a `throws` keyword that can take an error type and a bottom type to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; represent the error type of a non-throwing function, `rethrows` could<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; essentially be syntactic sugar for a function with a generic error<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; type. This would give us additional flexibility in cases like this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; where `rethrows` doesn&#39;t quite do what we need.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; With the necessary features in place, we could implement a `rethrows`-ish `sort(_:)` like this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	// This declaration has rethrows-like behavior: if `isOrderedBefore`&#39;s error type is `Never`, then <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	// `sort(_:)`&#39;s error type is also `Never`, and there&#39;s no reason to require a `try` on the call to this method.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	mutating func sort&lt;Error: ErrorProtocol&gt;(isOrderedBefore: (Element, Element) throws Error -&gt; Bool) throws Error {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 		var lastError: Error?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 		func isOrderedBeforeWithUnorderedErrors(a: Element, b: Element) -&gt; Bool {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 			do {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 				return try isOrderedBefore(a, b)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 			}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 			catch {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 				lastError = error<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 				return false<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 			}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 		}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 		// Do the actual sorting here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 		if lastError = lastError { throw lastError }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 	 }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; That&#39;s cute, but IIUC the designers of the error handling model<br>&gt;&gt; explicitly did *not* want to thread throwing-ness through generics in<br>&gt;&gt; this way.  This is roughly the same mechanism as would be required to<br>&gt;&gt; accomplish other things I&#39;d like to see, like the<br>&gt;&gt; sorting-throwing-Comparables thing I mentioned above, but that were<br>&gt;&gt; designed out of the model.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; FWIW, it would need to be generalized further, in case there were two<br>&gt;&gt; operations that throw different Error types.  Also, I know some will<br>&gt;&gt; disagree, but IMO you really don&#39;t want to get into a situation where<br>&gt;&gt; people are annotating most throwing functions with the exact Error types<br>&gt;&gt; that can be thrown.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; You need a way to express the type<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;    if (E0, E1, ...

IIUC, my original proposal for the<br>&gt; “rethrows” keyword would have solved these problems.  My understanding<br>&gt; was that it got no traction because solving them was considered an<br>&gt; anti-goal.<br></p><p>Like I said, I think it really depends on how coarse-grained the tracking is allowed to be,<br>and what impact that has on the rest of the language and its evolution.<br></p><p>John.<br></p><p><br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose you&#39;re trying to acknowledge that distinction when you say<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these cases are &quot;in the same ballpark&quot;, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really a sustainable objection.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Why not?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There *are* sensible alternatives, like the early-terminating block<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pattern, to throwing sequences and perhaps even throwing collections:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	try database.withQuery(sql) { rows in<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		for row in rows {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			// If fetching a row fails, this loop terminates early and `withQuery` throws<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			…<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; That strategy doesn&#39;t begin to cover the use cases for collections.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, how is it supposed to work? You need a way to report a failure to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; fetch the row—a way that doesn&#39;t involve throwing.  Who terminates the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; loop, and how?  How does withQuery detect that the loop exited early?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But throwing operations on stuff-inside-a-collection? That&#39;s just part<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the language, and making errors during sorting extraordinarily<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult to handle won&#39;t stop the errors from being possible.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#39;s basically no distinction.  If it&#39;s reasonable to have sort with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; a throwing predicate, it&#39;s also reasonable to have a Comparable type<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; whose &lt; operator throws, and it&#39;s reasonable to use the sort overload<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; that takes no explicit predicate, and now you have a Collection protocol<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; method that throws directly, rather than rethrowing.  IIUC from the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; people who designed Swift error handling, if you find yourself doing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; that, you&#39;ve done something wrong.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I actually think there *is* a sensible way to define the behavior of a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; throwing `sort(_:)`: you treat the comparison as though it returned<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `false` and continue sorting. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If there&#39;s any sort of stability to the errors being thrown by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; `isOrderedBefore`, this will end up behaving like a sort with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unordered elements, much like an array of floating-point types with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some NaNs in it. You not be able to rethrow all of the errors<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; encountered during the sort—you&#39;d have to pick the first or last—but a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; representative error would probably cover the use cases here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; As Dmitri pointed out, that predicate doesn&#39;t satisfy the requirements<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; for sorting.  It&#39;s quite possible that a predicate that doesn&#39;t satisfy<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; an algorithm&#39;s requirements causes the algorithm to do invalid indexing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; or some other evil nonsense.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You could implement this with today&#39;s Swift in terms of our existing `sort(_:)`:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	mutating func sort(isOrderedBefore: (Element, Element) throws -&gt; Bool) throws {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		var lastError: Error?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		sort {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			do {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 				return try isOrderedBefore($0, $1)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			catch {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 				lastError = error<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 				return false<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		if lastError = lastError { throw lastError }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Aside from the problems mentioned above, this is extremely inefficient<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; if the collection is large and backed a resource that fails slowly, such<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; as a network connection with retry and timeout.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think you could currently do one version with `rethrows`,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because any way you do this, you&#39;ll need to save an error in a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; variable and `throw` it later, which I don&#39;t believe `rethrows` will<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; permit. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Right.  That&#39;s a problem with the error-handling model.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, I saw a suggestion in the bottom type thread that, given both<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a `throws` keyword that can take an error type and a bottom type to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; represent the error type of a non-throwing function, `rethrows` could<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; essentially be syntactic sugar for a function with a generic error<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type. This would give us additional flexibility in cases like this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where `rethrows` doesn&#39;t quite do what we need.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With the necessary features in place, we could implement a `rethrows`-ish `sort(_:)` like this:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	// This declaration has rethrows-like behavior: if `isOrderedBefore`&#39;s error type is `Never`, then <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	// `sort(_:)`&#39;s error type is also `Never`, and there&#39;s no reason to require a `try` on the call to this method.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	mutating func sort&lt;Error: ErrorProtocol&gt;(isOrderedBefore: (Element, Element) throws Error -&gt; Bool) throws Error {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		var lastError: Error?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		func isOrderedBeforeWithUnorderedErrors(a: Element, b: Element) -&gt; Bool {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			do {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 				return try isOrderedBefore(a, b)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			catch {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 				lastError = error<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 				return false<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		// Do the actual sorting here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		if lastError = lastError { throw lastError }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	 }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; That&#39;s cute, but IIUC the designers of the error handling model<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; explicitly did *not* want to thread throwing-ness through generics in<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; this way.  This is roughly the same mechanism as would be required to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; accomplish other things I&#39;d like to see, like the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; sorting-throwing-Comparables thing I mentioned above, but that were<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; designed out of the model.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; FWIW, it would need to be generalized further, in case there were two<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; operations that throw different Error types.  Also, I know some will<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; disagree, but IMO you really don&#39;t want to get into a situation where<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; people are annotating most throwing functions with the exact Error types<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; that can be thrown.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; You need a way to express the type<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;   if (E0, E1, ... EN).contains(Bottom) then Bottom else ErrorProtocol<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; where Ei is one of the thrown error types, and for protocol methods that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; are not marked with an explicit throws annotation, that type should be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; synthesized automatically from the error types that can propagate from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; any operations in protocol dependencies... but ah, as I say, IIUC this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; sort of thing was designed out of the model.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; My point isn&#39;t that what you&#39;re trying to do is wrong.  My point is that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; it seems inconsistent with the Swift approach to error-handling, and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; that if you want to do these things, you may need to convince someone to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; change that approach.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With a fair bit of work, it might even be possible to allow it to throw *all* of the errors it encountered:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	// This is structured slightly strangely to ensure that, if Error is Never, then MultipleErrors&lt;Never&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	// is an empty enum (since all cases require a Never associated value), and thus (hopefully!) <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	// is itself a synonym for Never.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	enum MultipleErrors&lt;Error: ErrorProtocol&gt;: ErrorProtocol {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		case one (Error)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		indirect case many (Error, ErrorList&lt;Error&gt;)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		func appending(_ newError: Error) -&gt; MultipleErrors&lt;Error&gt; {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			switch self {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			case let .one(oldError):<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 				return .many(oldError, .one(newError))<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			case let .many(firstError, restErrors):<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 				return .many(firstError, restErrors.appending(newError))<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		}		<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	extension&lt;Error: ErrorProtocol&gt; Optional where Wrapped == MultipleErrors&lt;Error&gt; {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		func appending(_ newError: Error) -&gt; MultipleErrors&lt;Error&gt;? {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			switch self {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			case .none:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 				return .some(.one(newError))<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			case .some(let errors):<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 				return .some(errors.appending(newError))<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	mutating func sort&lt;Error: ErrorProtocol&gt;(isOrderedBefore: (Element, Element) throws Error -&gt; Bool) throws MultipleErrors&lt;Error&gt; {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		var errors: MultipleErrors&lt;Error&gt;?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		func isOrderedBeforeWithUnorderedErrors(a: Element, b: Element) -&gt; Bool {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			do {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 				return try isOrderedBefore(a, b)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			catch {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 				errors = errors.appending(error)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 				return false<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 			}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		// Do the actual sorting here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 		if errors = errors { throw errors }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 	 }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; IMO that would be a collosal waste of resources.  The only interesting<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; error is the first one.  This is notionally a sort that failed partway<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; through, and that we had no mechanism for interrupting.  The fact that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; you have to continue sorting after that error is just an artifact of<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; language limitations.  Either we should reaffirm our current (implicit)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; declaration that these kinds of use-cases are off the table for Swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; error handling, or the philosophy of Swift error-handling should change<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; to allow us to support stopping at the right time.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -- <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Dave<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Dave<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d53b7c5f9b5f5557b9082face9b632a0?s=50"></div><header><strong>Marking sort and sorted with rethrows</strong> from <string>Dave Abrahams</string> &lt;dabrahams at apple.com&gt;<p>June 20, 2016 at 09:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>on Thu Jun 09 2016, John McCall &lt;rjmccall-AT-apple.com&gt; wrote:<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; On Jun 9, 2016, at 12:59 PM, Dave Abrahams &lt;dabrahams at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; on Thu Jun 09 2016, John McCall &lt;rjmccall-AT-apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 9, 2016, at 9:04 AM, Dave Abrahams via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on Wed Jun 08 2016, Brent Royal-Gordon &lt;brent-AT-architechies.com &lt;http://brent-at-architechies.com/&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sure that these ideas are consistent with the Swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; error-handling philosophy, which IIUC is very consciously designed *not*<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to support things like file- and database-backed Collections.

If instances can be backed by a file,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; subscripting needs to be able to throw, and therefore practically every<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; generic function (or protocol extension method) on Collection would also<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; need to be marked as throwing.  When Swift error handling was designed,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it was decided that these cases were out-of-scope.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right.  It would be simple to change core library protocols to permit operations<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to throw, but then every use of an algorithm over those protocols would throw.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is the sort of problem that we address with &#39;rethrows&#39;, but that&#39;s quite a bit<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more complex to apply to protocol conformances because you need to be more<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; specific about which requirements, exactly, will cause you to rethrow.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you show an example?  It seems simple to me: if you&#39;re going to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possibly rethrow you can use any requirements that might throw, and if<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you&#39;re not going to rethrow then you can&#39;t.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Right, but we don&#39;t have a way to talk about whether individual<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; requirements or even conformances might throw.  It&#39;s not obvious that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; something as coarse-grained as &quot;a conformance is non-throwing if every<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; throwing requirement of the protocol and everything it inherits is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; satisfied by a non-throwing function&quot; is actually good enough to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; express the constraints we want to express, <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; In terms of expressivity, it *seems* to me that it would work out.  What<br>&gt;&gt; use-case are you concerned about?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In general, places where we have a &quot;large&quot; protocol and only one cluster of<br>&gt; functionality can throw for a particular conformance.  For example, maybe only<br>&gt; writes to a collection can throw.<br></p><p>I think when there&#39;s a significant difference in capability like that,<br>you tend to end up with a protocol refinement, such as<br>Collection/MutableCollection.  That ought to be enough to handle the<br>issue.<br></p><p>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; especially if we ever want to allow programmers to add additional<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (defaulted) requirements in protocol extensions.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Isn&#39;t that easily handled by limiting such Post-hoc defaulted<br>&gt;&gt; requirements to be nonthrowing or rethrows?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I think the rule would be that they would have to match the throwing-ness of the<br>&gt; primary conformance.  I&#39;m just saying that it would become a restriction on the<br>&gt; expressivity of additional requirements.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; John.<br></p><p>-- <br>Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
