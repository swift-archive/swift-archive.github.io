Type erasure is required to keep return types generic, e.g. rather than map returning an Array it returns an `AnyNextorable&lt;Element&gt;` (see point 5 below).<br>The protocols are not, in general, heirarchical; instead they are small building blocks at the top level that can be fitted together.<br>Protocols are split when a good default implementation cannot be provided, e.g. CountableCollection is seperate because the default of iterating and counting the elements is not a good implimentation of count.<br>Hierarchies are used for convenience, e.g. ArrayCollection is a convenience protocol that extends base protocols.<br>The protocol member&#39;s return generic implementations of protocols, e.g. where you might return an Array instead you return an `AnyNextorable&lt;Element&gt;`. This sidesteps issues with associated types and generics and prevents large type signatures. The downside is that you have comitted to a particular interface and therefore lost covariance. When generics are completed hopefully these return types can be replaced with `Any&lt;... where ...&gt;`, e.g. `Any&lt;Nextorable where Element == Element&gt;`<br>LazyNextable is split out seperately so that the semantics of lazy are articulated in the type system. The design of LazyNextable is also compatible with adding ParallelLazyNextable in the future.<br>The naming of the protocols is one of:<br>Xxxable because it is a main behavioural protocol and its main member is xxx, e.g. Nextorable has a main property nextor.<br>If in the rare case that a protocol extends another protocol then the new property is prepended, e.g. MutableSubstriptable extends Substriptable and the main method added is mutable subscripting.<br>If they don&#39;t have a main member then they are named after what they are used for, e.g. ArrayCollection defines the members of Array like collections. Note name format of XxxCollection.<br>AnyXxxx is a type erased implimentation of Xxx, e.g. AnyLazyNextable is an erased LazyNextable.<br>Xxxee and xxxee is used for the subject of an action, e.g. Rangee is a collection of methods that a type must impliment to be used in a Range.<br>Range has an Int index of 0 to count - 1 and a value of start + index * stride, where start and stride are of type Rangee. Int and Double via extension are made Rangees.<br>Index, used in Subscriptables, can be any type.<br></p><p><br>The main protocols that define what a collection is are:<br></p><p><br>/// Mutable, potentially infinite, and multiply traversable (because nextor is non-mutating) collection.<br>protocol Nextorable {<br>    associatedtype Element<br>    <br>    /// Give a new nextable for iterating through the collection.<br>    /// The collection can be iterated multiple times and therefore each Nextable must contain its own state.<br>    var nextor: AnyNextable&lt;Element&gt;
