Or was it intended that only one or the other be used in that scenario?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don’t think it was carefully considered, although I think it did come up at some point during discussion in the context of compatibility with existing code (i.e. nothing changes for current top-level `private` declarations).  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is in some sense a “coincidence” that they mean the same thing at file scope.  The proposal would have had to introduce a specific prohibition to prevent this situation and it did not do so.  That said, I think this kind of issue falls well within the discretion of the core team to make a call without violating the spirit of the proposal.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are two reasonable options here: <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Allow both `private` and `fileprivate` at file scope despite the fact that they have the same meaning.  This is more consistent in the sense that we are not introducing a special case that arbitrarily prohibits an otherwise valid access modifier.  It also means that nothing needs to change for top level `private` declarations in existing code.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Prohibit `private` at file scope.  Given that it appears as if the behavior of `private` at file scope may not be intuitive and is equivalent to `fileprivate` it might be reasonable to just disallow it.  This would result in more consistent *code* (even if there needs to be a special case in the language).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don’t have a strong opinion on which option we choose.  But I do feel strongly that the semantics of `private` need to properly respect the scope in which the keyword is written and into which the associated declaration is introduced (rather than the scope *inside* the declaration it is attached to).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Right, I think both would be OK. More radically, we might want to re-evaluate the continued utility of a `fileprivate` scope. It seems the use cases for such a scope not adequately served by either `internal` or the new `private` would be exceedingly rare.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I disagree with that.  `fileprivate` is indispensable when you need it.  There are times when you want to keep visibility limited to the current file but the new `private` is too restrictive (for example, you need to access a member of one type in a closely related extension of a different type that lives in the same file).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Sure. This was more of a thought for the future. As we move towards fully embracing a scope-based model for organizing code, modules will no longer need to be strictly &quot;single units of code distribution,&quot; and a move towards supporting submodules<br></p><p>Would be interesting to hear the core team on the topic of sub modules, considering how deep the implications would run to open that door (potential compatibility breaking change to the structure of the dylibs).

That, IMO, would be a logical endpoint of moving from file-based access to scope-based access.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Matthew<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -- <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Adrian Zubarev<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sent with Airmail<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Am 15.

Private for this declaration is at the file scope.  The `bar` member has no access modifier so it has the same visibility as the struct itself, which is file scope.  This will also be true of the implicitly synthesized memberwise initializer.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it is also private.  It does not inherit its parent scope because, following the letter of the proposal, that symbol will only be visible within the current declaration.  We cannot arbitrarily break access control rules because it is convenient in one special case. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This means that it is possible to initialize `foo` with a newly constructed instance of `Foo` and to modify the `bar` member anywhere else in the same file.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bar is not visible here.  If it were you could break access control rules.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If `bar` was also declared `private` this would not be possible as its visibility would be restricted to the surrounding scope of the initial declaration of `Foo`.  This means `Foo` would need to provide an explicit initializer or factory method with `fileprivate` visibility in order to be usable.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bar is private.  Declarations within Foo cannot decide to raise that access level to make themselves more visible.  If this should be the case, the proposal must be amended as much.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Members with no explicit access modifier should have the same *visibility* as their containing type (with a maximum implicit visibility of internal), not the same *modifier* as their containing type.  The only case where there is a distinction is the new `private` visibility.  Maybe that is what is causing the confusion?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is not what the proposal says.  The proposal says it is invisible outside the current decl, which is the containing structure here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The access modifier is applied to `Foo`, not `bar`.  `Foo` is visible in the scope of the “current declaration” (this is badly worded - it should say current scope, which is the file).  Because `Foo` has a visibility lower than `internal` the default visibility of its members match the visibility of `Foo`, which again is the current scope: the file.  The detailed design section of the proposal is sparse, but it correctly uses the phrase &quot;visible only within that lexical scope” rather than the less precise (in the case of top-level code) “current declaration”.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn’t write the proposal but I was very heavily involved in the discussions and IIRC I provided the original suggestion for introducing a scoped access modifier.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If my example was the following:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; private struct Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   private var bar: Int<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then what you are saying would be correct.  However, The example I showed did not provide an access modifier for `bar`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot just apply the same *access modifier* to members of the type that do not contain an access modifier.  You have to apply the same *visibility* (limited to internal).  When a type is marked as `private` in the lexical scope of the file, its unmodified members will be visible in the same lexical scope as the type itself (which is the file in the current example).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Matthew<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Does this help?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Matthew<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ~Robert Widmann<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2016/06/15 11:36、Matthew Johnson &lt;matthew at anandabits.com &lt;mailto:matthew at anandabits.com&gt;&gt; のメッセージ:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The scope for a top-level declaration is the file itself.

The motivation behind the fileprivate/private distinction is, as you say in the proposal &quot;[a] reliable way to hide implementation details...&quot;.  Why would you want any members you&#39;re trying to hide to be visible in any scope other than the one you create with the decl (which is, without a doubt, also a lexical scope)?  It is analogous with other access control levels: a public outer decl implies public inner members just as a fileprivate one implies fileprivate inner members.  Is it not antithetical to being able to hide things if they remain visible despite the outer decl declaring itself supposedly being sealed?  In your examples, you declare private members that you do not wish to leak into top level scope because they are, after all, supposedly hidden.  Should the same semantics you have given not also apply to private decls no matter where they lie? <br></p><p>Should this compile:<br></p><p>private struct Outer {<br>    let inner = Inner()<br>}<br></p><p>Outer().inner<br></p><p>If this shouldn&#39;t:<br></p><p>struct Outer {<br>    private let inner = Inner()<br>}<br></p><p>extension Outer {<br>    var inner2 : Inner { return self.inner }<br>}<br></p><p>Visibility being a function of scope, lexical or otherwise, seems too coarse a metric for access control in general without further clarification of what the definition of &quot;hidden&quot; is.<br></p><p>~Robert Widmann<br></p><p>2016/06/15 12:38、Matthew Johnson &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt; のメッセージ:<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jun 15, 2016, at 2:29 PM, Robert Widmann &lt;devteam.codafi at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The meaning of private according to the proposal is not scope-dependent, it is decl-dependent.

Private for this declaration is at the file scope.  The `bar` member has no access modifier so it has the same visibility as the struct itself, which is file scope.  This will also be true of the implicitly synthesized memberwise initializer.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it is also private.  It does not inherit its parent scope because, following the letter of the proposal, that symbol will only be visible within the current declaration.  We cannot arbitrarily break access control rules because it is convenient in one special case. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This means that it is possible to initialize `foo` with a newly constructed instance of `Foo` and to modify the `bar` member anywhere else in the same file.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bar is not visible here.

This means `Foo` would need to provide an explicit initializer or factory method with `fileprivate` visibility in order to be usable.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bar is private.  Declarations within Foo cannot decide to raise that access level to make themselves more visible.  If this should be the case, the proposal must be amended as much.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Members with no explicit access modifier should have the same *visibility* as their containing type (with a maximum implicit visibility of internal), not the same *modifier* as their containing type.

Maybe that is what is causing the confusion?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is not what the proposal says.  The proposal says it is invisible outside the current decl, which is the containing structure here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The access modifier is applied to `Foo`, not `bar`.  `Foo` is visible in the scope of the “current declaration” (this is badly worded - it should say current scope, which is the file).  Because `Foo` has a visibility lower than `internal` the default visibility of its members match the visibility of `Foo`, which again is the current scope: the file.  The detailed design section of the proposal is sparse, but it correctly uses the phrase &quot;visible only within that lexical scope” rather than the less precise (in the case of top-level code) “current declaration”.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn’t write the proposal but I was very heavily involved in the discussions and IIRC I provided the original suggestion for introducing a scoped access modifier.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If my example was the following:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; private struct Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   private var bar: Int<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then what you are saying would be correct.  However, The example I showed did not provide an access modifier for `bar`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot just apply the same *access modifier* to members of the type that do not contain an access modifier.  You have to apply the same *visibility* (limited to internal).  When a type is marked as `private` in the lexical scope of the file, its unmodified members will be visible in the same lexical scope as the type itself (which is the file in the current example).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Matthew<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Does this help?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Matthew<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ~Robert Widmann<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2016/06/15 11:36、Matthew Johnson &lt;matthew at anandabits.com &lt;mailto:matthew at anandabits.com&gt;&gt; のメッセージ:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The scope for a top-level declaration is the file itself.

Why would you want any members you&#39;re trying to hide to be visible in any scope other than the one you create with the decl (which is, without a doubt, also a lexical scope)?  It is analogous with other access control levels: a public outer decl implies public inner members just as a fileprivate one implies fileprivate inner members.  Is it not antithetical to being able to hide things if they remain visible despite the outer decl declaring itself supposedly being sealed?

If no modifier is provided for `x` it receives the same visibility as its containing type (up to `internal`).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Consider another example:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; struct Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     private struct Bar {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         var x : String = “”<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In this example we *cannot* mark `x` as `fileprivate` because that *would* raise the visibility of `x` beyond that of `Bar`.  `Bar` is only visible inside `Foo`, not at file scope.  This means that `x` also has visibility throughout the lexical scope of `Foo`, but not outside of it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Matthew<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ~Robert Widmann<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2016/06/15 12:14、Matthew Johnson &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt; のメッセージ:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 15, 2016, at 2:04 PM, Robert Widmann &lt;devteam.codafi at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2016/06/15 11:47、Matthew Johnson &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt; のメッセージ:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 15, 2016, at 1:37 PM, Robert Widmann &lt;devteam.codafi at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The scope of the *declaration* is not the issue.

Private for this declaration is at the file scope.  The `bar` member has no access modifier so it has the same visibility as the struct itself, which is file scope.  This will also be true of the implicitly synthesized memberwise initializer.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it is also private.  It does not inherit its parent scope because, following the letter of the proposal, that symbol will only be visible within the current declaration.

This means `Foo` would need to provide an explicit initializer or factory method with `fileprivate` visibility in order to be usable.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bar is private.

Maybe that is what is causing the confusion?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is not what the proposal says.  The proposal says it is invisible outside the current decl, which is the containing structure here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The access modifier is applied to `Foo`, not `bar`.  `Foo` is visible in the scope of the “current declaration” (this is badly worded - it should say current scope, which is the file).  Because `Foo` has a visibility lower than `internal` the default visibility of its members match the visibility of `Foo`, which again is the current scope: the file.  The detailed design section of the proposal is sparse, but it correctly uses the phrase &quot;visible only within that lexical scope” rather than the less precise (in the case of top-level code) “current declaration”.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn’t write the proposal but I was very heavily involved in the discussions and IIRC I provided the original suggestion for introducing a scoped access modifier.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If my example was the following:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; private struct Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   private var bar: Int<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then what you are saying would be correct.

You have to apply the same *visibility* (limited to internal).  When a type is marked as `private` in the lexical scope of the file, its unmodified members will be visible in the same lexical scope as the type itself (which is the file in the current example).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Matthew<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Does this help?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Matthew<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ~Robert Widmann<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2016/06/15 11:36、Matthew Johnson &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt; のメッセージ:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The scope for a top-level declaration is the file itself.

The motivation behind the fileprivate/private distinction is, as you say in the proposal &quot;[a] reliable way to hide implementation details...&quot;.  Why would you want any members you&#39;re trying to hide to be visible in any scope other than the one you create with the decl (which is, without a doubt, also a lexical scope)?  It is analogous with other access control levels: a public outer decl implies public inner members just as a fileprivate one implies fileprivate inner members.  Is it not antithetical to being able to hide things if they remain visible despite the outer decl declaring itself supposedly being sealed?  In your examples, you declare private members that you do not wish to leak into top level scope because they are, after all, supposedly hidden.  Should the same semantics you have given not also apply to private decls no matter where they lie? <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry, missed the example in my last reply.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Should this compile:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; private struct Outer {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     let inner = Inner()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Outer().inner<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Aside from the fact that you can&#39;t write a standalone statement at the top level of a file and it isn&#39;t clear what &#39;Inner&#39; is, yes.

Private for this declaration is at the file scope.  The `bar` member has no access modifier so it has the same visibility as the struct itself, which is file scope.  This will also be true of the implicitly synthesized memberwise initializer.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it is also private.  It does not inherit its parent scope because, following the letter of the proposal, that symbol will only be visible within the current declaration.  We cannot arbitrarily break access control rules because it is convenient in one special case. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This means that it is possible to initialize `foo` with a newly constructed instance of `Foo` and to modify the `bar` member anywhere else in the same file.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bar is not visible here.  If it were you could break access control rules.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If `bar` was also declared `private` this would not be possible as its visibility would be restricted to the surrounding scope of the initial declaration of `Foo`.  This means `Foo` would need to provide an explicit initializer or factory method with `fileprivate` visibility in order to be usable.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bar is private.  Declarations within Foo cannot decide to raise that access level to make themselves more visible.  If this should be the case, the proposal must be amended as much.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Members with no explicit access modifier should have the same *visibility* as their containing type (with a maximum implicit visibility of internal), not the same *modifier* as their containing type.  The only case where there is a distinction is the new `private` visibility.  Maybe that is what is causing the confusion?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is not what the proposal says.  The proposal says it is invisible outside the current decl, which is the containing structure here.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The access modifier is applied to `Foo`, not `bar`.  `Foo` is visible in the scope of the “current declaration” (this is badly worded - it should say current scope, which is the file).  Because `Foo` has a visibility lower than `internal` the default visibility of its members match the visibility of `Foo`, which again is the current scope: the file.  The detailed design section of the proposal is sparse, but it correctly uses the phrase &quot;visible only within that lexical scope” rather than the less precise (in the case of top-level code) “current declaration”.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn’t write the proposal but I was very heavily involved in the discussions and IIRC I provided the original suggestion for introducing a scoped access modifier.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If my example was the following:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; private struct Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   private var bar: Int<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then what you are saying would be correct.  However, The example I showed did not provide an access modifier for `bar`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot just apply the same *access modifier* to members of the type that do not contain an access modifier.  You have to apply the same *visibility* (limited to internal).  When a type is marked as `private` in the lexical scope of the file, its unmodified members will be visible in the same lexical scope as the type itself (which is the file in the current example).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Matthew<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Does this help?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -Matthew<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ~Robert Widmann<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2016/06/15 11:36、Matthew Johnson &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt; のメッセージ:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The scope for a top-level declaration is the file itself.

Under the implementation outlined there, any top-level structure, class, or enum declared private cannot possibly be instantiated and so cannot be used in any way.  Because of this, private top-level declarations are more often than not blown away entirely by the compiler for being unused.

They are internal.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jun 15, 2016, at 10:49 PM, Robert Widmann &lt;devteam.codafi at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Also consider what would happen if we did allow access control to escalate here: Suppose that code did not emit a diagnostic, then the member is still private because you cannot reference the class outside of file scope.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Which is… exactly what we want.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; You see, even if we did escalate access control for unannotated members, even if we did that (which we don&#39;t) you wouldn&#39;t even be able to reap the benefits.  It makes no sense.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; A good way to think of it is in terms of what permissions are *removed* by the access modifiers, rather than *added*. Then, everything makes perfect sense:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Public removes nothing.<br>&gt; Internal removes access outside a module.<br>&gt; Fileprivate removes access outside a file.<br>&gt; Private removes access outside a declaration.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you have an internal property within a public type, the “public” modifier removes nothing, and the “internal” modifier then removes access from outside that module. The result is access from only within the module.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you have an internal property within an internal type, the “internal” modifier on the type removes access from outside the module, and then the “internal” modifier on the property would remove access from outside the module, except that such access is already removed. Result is access from only within the module.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; With an internal property inside a private type within another type, the “private” modifier on the type removes access from outside its parent type, and the “internal” modifier removes access from outside the module―but since no entities outside the type’s parent type currently have access, and since the parent type is in the current module anyway, this once again has no effect. Result is that the property is only accessible from inside its parent type.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; With an internal property inside a private type that’s at the top of the file’s scope, the “private” modifier on the type removes access from outside the file, and the “internal” modifier removes access from outside the module―but since no entities outside the file currently have access, and since the file is in the current module, this once again has no effect. Result is that the property is only accessible from inside the current file.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; And etc.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Charles<br>&gt; <br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160615/fc47a2fb/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Discussion] A Problem With SE-0025?</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>June 16, 2016 at 12:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Charles we&#39;ve diverged from the actual issue at hand to nitpick my English.

With the core team tied up at WWDC, you may want to temporarily forbid the use of `private` on a type and revisit the matter when people are less busy; if necessary, we could even ship Swift 3 that way. Or you may want to consider making a guess as to a good implementation model to apply. Two suggestions for alternate implementation models:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a. Introduce a `parent` access level, meaning &quot;visible in scopes within this file where the parent is visible&quot;, which is between `fileprivate` and `private`. Just as `internal` is the maximum inherited access level, `parent` is the minimum, so the members of a `private` type would inherit `parent` visibility. `parent` might be an entirely compiler-internal concept, with no utterable access control keyword.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thinking about this more, I notice that `fileprivate` as currently defined doesn&#39;t actually make any sense to say inside a `private` type: if your parent type has less-than-file-wide visibility, nothing in the file that&#39;s outside its scope can see you anyway. Therefore, we could redefine `fileprivate` thusly:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. A member with `fileprivate` visibility is visible within the scope in which the nearest containing `private` type is visible.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. If there are no containing `private` types, it is visible within the file containing it.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Just as the members of a `public` type are `internal`, so the members of a `private` type are `fileprivate`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This kind of suggests that we ought to rename `fileprivate` to something that, y&#39;know, doesn&#39;t say &quot;file&quot; in it. However, I can scarcely imagine the results of a round of bikeshedding without parental supervision from the core team, so I don&#39;t dare make any suggestions.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am not convinced this is necessary.  If there *is* a containing &#39;private&#39; scope you can just leave the member unannotated to get this behavior.  If there isn&#39;t you can use &#39;fileprivate&#39; as it is already defined.  Why is that not sufficient?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you really want a second, more nuanced and complex scope-dependent access control mechanism I think you&#39;ll need to submit a proposal for it.

You may have gleaned that from the spirit of this proposal, but its letter says nothing of the sort.  Access and visibility are one and the same in the compiler.  We use access to determine (for lack of a better word) the &quot;lookup-ability&quot; of a symbol (hence its visibility) during Sema.  To divorce or tie the two any further is not specified and should have been originally.  If you honestly believe that we should break containment because that is the right thing to do then I need the proposal to match that belief.  Otherwise, the implementation I have is subject to the issue in root.<br></p><p>If you read the very example given in that proposal, you will see that the author intended private members to be scoped by their containing declaration.  There is precisely zero mention of top-level semantics.

As it is, you can&#39;t just drop the visibility of a type without fixing all of its members.<br></p><p>It is just a warning already, but I think it’s a useful one: &quot;you marked this thing public but the type isn’t, did you make a mistake?” Even with what little coding I get to do in Swift I’ve hit this, though usually the mistake is “I meant to mark the type public too.”<br></p><p>Jordan<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160623/ab20d8da/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4fe988326eed161b989d0c5521cb105?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Discussion] A Problem With SE-0025?</strong> from <string>Jordan Rose</string> &lt;jordan_rose at apple.com&gt;<p>June 27, 2016 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>Robert and I wrote up the changes in the form of an amendment to SE-0025: https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/383 &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/383&gt;.

I came out of the experiment more disappointed than I thought. Here are several reasons:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) The new rules make `private` more prominent compared to `fileprivate` (the latter has a somewhat worse name). But at the same time, the Swift community has developed a style of coding where a type is defined through a set of extensions. To hide members from other types, but have access to them inside the type extensions, we have often used `private` and placed the type and its extensions in the same file. Because `private` is scoped, we are forced into using `fileprivate` pervasively (which is uglier), using `internal` instead (which is less safe) or moving the extension code into the type&#39;s scope (which is against the way Swift code is being written today). All of these options look worse to be than before SE-0025.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If I understand SE-0025 (even with the amendment) you can still spell the access modifier to types as &#39;private&#39; and get the same characteristics as the pre-SE-0025 meaning or private, so I&#39;m not sure I understand the concern here. However (continued below)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) The new amended rules look complicated to me. I think they have the risk of being confusing in practice, but we’ll have to see.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I definitely agree that the amended rules look complicated. It seems to me that the amended set of rules is favoring simplifying the implementation over simplifying the mental model.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; My impression of what SE-0025 decided was that &#39;private&#39; meant private to the enclosing scope. If the access modifying &#39;private&#39; was applied to a type at the file scope, then it was synonymous with fileprivate and the default access of members of that type should be fileprivate.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If a inner type was declared private, than the default access of members of that inner type should be private to the Outer type, not fileprivate. There is currently no way of expressing this access explicitly, but it does not seem like an especially useful thing to need to spell.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Said in code, my impression of SE-0025 is that <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; private class Outer { // exactly equivalent to fileprivate<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     var myVar = 0 // default: fileprivate<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     private class Inner { // private to Outer<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         var hiddenVar = 0 // default: private to Outer<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         private var reallyHiddenVar = 0 // default private to Inner<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; This is definitely one of the considered alternatives. Both Brent and I didn’t like the idea of an access level that you couldn’t actually spell, and even if we got past that, we’d still need a way to refer to it in documentation and diagnostics.

But a lightbulb went off reading the amendment, specifically this parenthetical statement:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; &quot;(The members [defaulting to fileprivate inside a private type] still cannot be accessed outside the enclosing lexical scope because the type itself is still private, i.e. outside code will never encounter a value of that type.)&quot;<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Given that this is the case, wouldn&#39;t the same problem be entirely obviated by the following change to the formal rules:<br>&gt;&gt; The default level of access control within any type (public, internal, fileprivate, or private) is `internal`.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; In the case of fileprivate or private types, the `internal` members still cannot be accessed where the containing type cannot be accessed.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That does seem simpler at first, but it doesn’t remove any of the later, more complicated rules about minimum access, and when you can use a less accessible type in a (formally but not in practice) more-accessible declaration.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Your second rule as written is straight-up ungrammatical, so I can&#39;t say if it makes any sense or becomes any more or less complicated (&quot;a member...may have `private` type&quot;--huh?).<br></p><p>It’s…compiler-grammar?

I came out of the experiment more<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; disappointed than I thought. Here are several reasons:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) The new rules make `private` more prominent compared to `fileprivate`<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (the latter has a somewhat worse name). But at the same time, the Swift<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; community has developed a style of coding where a type is defined through a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; set of extensions. To hide members from other types, but have access to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; them inside the type extensions, we have often used `private` and placed<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; the type and its extensions in the same file. Because `private` is scoped,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; we are forced into using `fileprivate` pervasively (which is uglier), using<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; `internal` instead (which is less safe) or moving the extension code into<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; the type&#39;s scope (which is against the way Swift code is being written<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; today). All of these options look worse to be than before SE-0025.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If I understand SE-0025 (even with the amendment) you can still spell<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; the access modifier to types as &#39;private&#39; and get the same characteristics<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; as the pre-SE-0025 meaning or private, so I&#39;m not sure I understand the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; concern here. However (continued below)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) The new amended rules look complicated to me. I think they have the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; risk of being confusing in practice, but we’ll have to see.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I definitely agree that the amended rules look complicated. It seems to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; me that the amended set of rules is favoring simplifying the implementation<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; over simplifying the mental model.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; My impression of what SE-0025 decided was that &#39;private&#39; meant private<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; to the enclosing scope. If the access modifying &#39;private&#39; was applied to a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; type at the file scope, then it was synonymous with fileprivate and the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; default access of members of that type should be fileprivate.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If a inner type was declared private, than the default access of members<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; of that inner type should be private to the Outer type, not fileprivate.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; There is currently no way of expressing this access explicitly, but it does<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; not seem like an especially useful thing to need to spell.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Said in code, my impression of SE-0025 is that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; private class Outer { // exactly equivalent to fileprivate<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     var myVar = 0 // default: fileprivate<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     private class Inner { // private to Outer<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         var hiddenVar = 0 // default: private to Outer<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;         private var reallyHiddenVar = 0 // default private to Inner<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This is definitely one of the considered alternatives. Both Brent and I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; didn’t like the idea of an access level that you couldn’t actually spell,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; and even if we got past that, we’d still need a way to refer to it in<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; documentation and diagnostics. I would count that as a larger change than<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; just allowing ‘fileprivate’ in places that previously would have been<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; called redundant.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I&#39;m late to the party here, but I share the feeling that perhaps the<br>&gt;&gt; amendment introduces a complicated mental model. But a lightbulb went off<br>&gt;&gt; reading the amendment, specifically this parenthetical statement:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &quot;(The members [defaulting to fileprivate inside a private type] still<br>&gt;&gt; cannot be accessed outside the enclosing lexical scope because the type<br>&gt;&gt; itself is still private, i.e. outside code will never encounter a value of<br>&gt;&gt; that type.)&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Given that this is the case, wouldn&#39;t the same problem be entirely<br>&gt;&gt; obviated by the following change to the formal rules:<br>&gt;&gt; The default level of access control within any type (public, internal,<br>&gt;&gt; fileprivate, or private) is `internal`.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; In the case of fileprivate or private types, the `internal` members still<br>&gt;&gt; cannot be accessed where the containing type cannot be accessed.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; That does seem simpler at first, but it doesn’t remove any of the later,<br>&gt;&gt; more complicated rules about *minimum* access, and when you can use a<br>&gt;&gt; less accessible type in a (formally but not in practice) more-accessible<br>&gt;&gt; declaration.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Your second rule as written is straight-up ungrammatical, so I can&#39;t say<br>&gt; if it makes any sense or becomes any more or less complicated (&quot;a<br>&gt; member...may have `private` type&quot;--huh?).<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It’s…compiler-grammar? We say something “has pointer type” fairly often<br>&gt; within the compiler group. I’ll change it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; “A method, initializer, subscript, property, or typealias<br>&gt; with `fileprivate` access may have a type that references `private`<br>&gt; declarations if (1) the declaration with `fileprivate` access is a member<br>&gt; of a private type, and (2) all referenced `private` declarations are<br>&gt; defined within an enclosing lexical scope. That is, it is legal for<br>&gt; a `fileprivate` member within a `private` type to have a type that is<br>&gt; formally `private` if it would be legal for a `private` declaration in the<br>&gt; parent scope to have that type.”<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Is this clear, or still senseless?<br>&gt;<br></p><p>That&#39;s very clear now.<br></p><p>Independent of the issue of the written text, though, the idea you are<br>expressing is very complicated and a special case for a generalizable<br>principle. That is, if you loosen the requirement so that a method, etc.,<br>can have an access level formally broader than that of its containing type<br>(in your example below, `Inner`), it should still be permissible for that<br>method to make use of a type with more restrictive access if that<br>restrictive access is at least as broad as that of the containing type.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt; This rule is intended to allow this case:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; struct Outer {<br>&gt;   private typealias Value = Int<br>&gt;   private struct Inner {<br>&gt;     /*fileprivate*/ var value: Value<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; while disallowing this case:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; struct Outer {<br>&gt;   private struct Inner {<br>&gt;     private typealias Value = Int<br>&gt;     fileprivate var value: Value = 0<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Do you think that should appear in the proposal text?<br>&gt;<br></p><p>I think that would help.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The rule about minimum access is needlessly complicated: `private` can<br>&gt; never satisfy a protocol requirement or be used for a required initializer<br>&gt; because of the very fact that it is private. We needn&#39;t say that<br>&gt; `fileprivate` is the minimum access required since there&#39;s nothing about<br>&gt; `fileprivate` that makes it the minimum. Thought experiment: if another<br>&gt; access level were to be introduced between `private` and `fileprivate`,<br>&gt; that could become the minimum access required. However, no matter what, it<br>&gt; is inherent to the SE-0025 definition of `private` that it can never<br>&gt; satisfy a requirement.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I admit that I don’t think most people understand what the rules are for<br>&gt; minimum access to satisfy a requirement: the minimum of the type’s access<br>&gt; and the protocol’s access. But maybe it’s good enough to say “A private<br>&gt; member may never satisfy a protocol requirement. Required initializers may<br>&gt; not be private.” and not give further justification; the previous changes<br>&gt; already allow that. (I already ducked out of justification by saying “to<br>&gt; satisfy the spirit of existing requirements”, so this wouldn’t really be<br>&gt; any worse.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The rule about members inside extensions with access modifiers is<br>&gt; consistent with existing rules and doesn&#39;t need to be called out. That<br>&gt; said, does a `private extension` make sense at all?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I was inclined to write it explicitly after Adrian Z’s proposal to change<br>&gt; the behavior of extensions, which implied to me that the current behavior<br>&gt; was non-obvious. Since extensions just set the default access level, I<br>&gt; could see *someone* doing this to enforce that access to all of their<br>&gt; non-helper API was called out explicitly. I’m not a fan, but it doesn’t<br>&gt; seem to hurt anything.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>It raises a question. Is `foo` inside `private extension { func foo... }`<br>supposed to be exactly the same as that inside `extension { private func<br>foo... }` (i.e. not visible outside the extension)? That seems useless and<br>counterintuitive. However, if not, then `private extension { func foo... }`<br>is equivalent to `fileprivate extension { func foo... }`, which is both<br>confusing and redundant.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Once those are in place, it seems better to use fileprivate, as the next<br>&gt;&gt; level up, so that we can still warn about mistaken uses of ‘internal’, and<br>&gt;&gt; so that we don’t have to special-case code later on in the pipeline that<br>&gt;&gt; uses visibility to optimize.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Mistaken explicit use of `internal` can still be warned on. In your<br>&gt; proposal, `fileprivate` inside `private` still leaves room for optimization<br>&gt; that would require special-casing, no? In my proposed formulation,<br>&gt; `internal` simply takes on the practical meaning of &quot;as visible to the<br>&gt; module as can be given what it&#39;s contained in&quot;, which seems like a<br>&gt; principled take that could be optimized without regarding it as<br>&gt; &quot;special-casing”.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I don’t think there are any cases of ‘fileprivate&#39; that can meaningfully<br>&gt; be “optimized” down to ‘private’. Just because no one’s using something<br>&gt; outside of the type *now* doesn’t mean it isn’t used at all. Maybe it’s<br>&gt; being used on the other side of a #if branch.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>Sorry, that&#39;s not what I meant. And since I don&#39;t have the best words, it<br>may take me a while to express my point.<br></p><p><br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; (Alternately, I don’t think that’s the part of the mental model people<br>&gt;&gt; are having trouble with.)<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Maybe it&#39;s just me, but that&#39;s the first part of the mental model that&#39;s<br>&gt; exploding my mind.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hm. I really didn’t expect this—to me, it’s just “fileprivate is allowed<br>&gt; inside private types” and then “fix all the fallout so that the compiler<br>&gt; only shouts at you when necessary”. Can you say what the model change is to<br>&gt; you?<br>&gt;<br></p><p>With respect to this particular rule, it&#39;s already been pointed out that<br>things are already complicated (public types have default internal members,<br>but internal types have default internal members and fileprivate types have<br>default fileprivate members). Granted, there is a very good rationale for<br>the behavior. However, add yet another subrule and you may has well just<br>have a table, because a general rule that applies to two things with two<br>different exceptions for two other things is essentially no general rule at<br>all. Since the point you&#39;re making is that we have to relax the rules about<br>access levels nested inside types anyway, the most consistent rule I can<br>think of is &quot;the default access level is always internal&quot;. And I think it<br>would actually be workable.<br></p><p>Thanks for all the feedback.<br>&gt; Jordan<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160629/dfba93cc/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8d9dbc0dfeb74eab8dd9bbd9cbd84680?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Discussion] A Problem With SE-0025?</strong> from <string>Jose Cheyo Jimenez</string> &lt;cheyo at masters3d.com&gt;<p>June 29, 2016 at 01:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>I know this might be have been brought up before but <br></p><p>why not just disallow the “private&quot; keyword for top level types, extensions etc. <br></p><p>A fixit could change top level `private` to `fileprivate`. <br></p><p>I think this is a little less confusing since effectively this is what is happening in the background. <br></p><p><br>&gt; On Jun 29, 2016, at 10:20 AM, Jordan Rose via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jun 29, 2016, at 09:59, Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com &lt;mailto:xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Wed, Jun 29, 2016 at 11:31 AM, Jordan Rose &lt;jordan_rose at apple.com &lt;mailto:jordan_rose at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 29, 2016, at 08:49, Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com &lt;mailto:xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Tue, Jun 28, 2016 at 9:06 PM, Jordan Rose via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 28, 2016, at 19:03, Matthew Judge &lt;matthew.judge at gmail.com &lt;mailto:matthew.judge at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Comments inline.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 28, 2016, at 04:14, David Hart via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello everybody,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I tried using the access rules defined in SE-0025 in some code of mine to see what effect it would have.

Because `private` is scoped, we are forced into using `fileprivate` pervasively (which is uglier), using `internal` instead (which is less safe) or moving the extension code into the type&#39;s scope (which is against the way Swift code is being written today). All of these options look worse to be than before SE-0025.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I understand SE-0025 (even with the amendment) you can still spell the access modifier to types as &#39;private&#39; and get the same characteristics as the pre-SE-0025 meaning or private, so I&#39;m not sure I understand the concern here. However (continued below)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) The new amended rules look complicated to me. I think they have the risk of being confusing in practice, but we’ll have to see.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I definitely agree that the amended rules look complicated. It seems to me that the amended set of rules is favoring simplifying the implementation over simplifying the mental model.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My impression of what SE-0025 decided was that &#39;private&#39; meant private to the enclosing scope. If the access modifying &#39;private&#39; was applied to a type at the file scope, then it was synonymous with fileprivate and the default access of members of that type should be fileprivate.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If a inner type was declared private, than the default access of members of that inner type should be private to the Outer type, not fileprivate. There is currently no way of expressing this access explicitly, but it does not seem like an especially useful thing to need to spell.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Said in code, my impression of SE-0025 is that <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; private class Outer { // exactly equivalent to fileprivate<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     var myVar = 0 // default: fileprivate<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     private class Inner { // private to Outer<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         var hiddenVar = 0 // default: private to Outer<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         private var reallyHiddenVar = 0 // default private to Inner<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; This is definitely one of the considered alternatives. Both Brent and I didn’t like the idea of an access level that you couldn’t actually spell, and even if we got past that, we’d still need a way to refer to it in documentation and diagnostics. I would count that as a larger change than just allowing ‘fileprivate’ in places that previously would have been called redundant.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m late to the party here, but I share the feeling that perhaps the amendment introduces a complicated mental model. But a lightbulb went off reading the amendment, specifically this parenthetical statement:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;(The members [defaulting to fileprivate inside a private type] still cannot be accessed outside the enclosing lexical scope because the type itself is still private, i.e. outside code will never encounter a value of that type.)&quot;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Given that this is the case, wouldn&#39;t the same problem be entirely obviated by the following change to the formal rules:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The default level of access control within any type (public, internal, fileprivate, or private) is `internal`.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; In the case of fileprivate or private types, the `internal` members still cannot be accessed where the containing type cannot be accessed.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; That does seem simpler at first, but it doesn’t remove any of the later, more complicated rules about minimum access, and when you can use a less accessible type in a (formally but not in practice) more-accessible declaration.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Your second rule as written is straight-up ungrammatical, so I can&#39;t say if it makes any sense or becomes any more or less complicated (&quot;a member...may have `private` type&quot;--huh?).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It’s…compiler-grammar? We say something “has pointer type” fairly often within the compiler group. I’ll change it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; “A method, initializer, subscript, property, or typealias with `fileprivate` access may have a type that references `private` declarations if (1) the declaration with `fileprivate` access is a member of a private type, and (2) all referenced `private` declarations are defined within an enclosing lexical scope. That is, it is legal for a `fileprivate` member within a `private` type to have a type that is formally `private` if it would be legal for a `private` declaration in the parent scope to have that type.”<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Is this clear, or still senseless?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This rule is intended to allow this case:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; struct Outer {<br>&gt;   private typealias Value = Int<br>&gt;   private struct Inner {<br>&gt;     /*fileprivate*/ var value: Value<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; while disallowing this case:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; struct Outer {<br>&gt;   private struct Inner {<br>&gt;     private typealias Value = Int<br>&gt;     fileprivate var value: Value = 0<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Do you think that should appear in the proposal text?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The rule about minimum access is needlessly complicated: `private` can never satisfy a protocol requirement or be used for a required initializer because of the very fact that it is private. We needn&#39;t say that `fileprivate` is the minimum access required since there&#39;s nothing about `fileprivate` that makes it the minimum. Thought experiment: if another access level were to be introduced between `private` and `fileprivate`, that could become the minimum access required. However, no matter what, it is inherent to the SE-0025 definition of `private` that it can never satisfy a requirement.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I admit that I don’t think most people understand what the rules are for minimum access to satisfy a requirement: the minimum of the type’s access and the protocol’s access. But maybe it’s good enough to say “A private member may never satisfy a protocol requirement. Required initializers may not be private.” and not give further justification; the previous changes already allow that. (I already ducked out of justification by saying “to satisfy the spirit of existing requirements”, so this wouldn’t really be any worse.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; The rule about members inside extensions with access modifiers is consistent with existing rules and doesn&#39;t need to be called out. That said, does a `private extension` make sense at all?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I was inclined to write it explicitly after Adrian Z’s proposal to change the behavior of extensions, which implied to me that the current behavior was non-obvious. Since extensions just set the default access level, I could see someone doing this to enforce that access to all of their non-helper API was called out explicitly. I’m not a fan, but it doesn’t seem to hurt anything.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Once those are in place, it seems better to use fileprivate, as the next level up, so that we can still warn about mistaken uses of ‘internal’, and so that we don’t have to special-case code later on in the pipeline that uses visibility to optimize.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Mistaken explicit use of `internal` can still be warned on. In your proposal, `fileprivate` inside `private` still leaves room for optimization that would require special-casing, no? In my proposed formulation, `internal` simply takes on the practical meaning of &quot;as visible to the module as can be given what it&#39;s contained in&quot;, which seems like a principled take that could be optimized without regarding it as &quot;special-casing”.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I don’t think there are any cases of ‘fileprivate&#39; that can meaningfully be “optimized” down to ‘private’. Just because no one’s using something outside of the type now doesn’t mean it isn’t used at all. Maybe it’s being used on the other side of a #if branch.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; (Alternately, I don’t think that’s the part of the mental model people are having trouble with.)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Maybe it&#39;s just me, but that&#39;s the first part of the mental model that&#39;s exploding my mind. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hm. I really didn’t expect this—to me, it’s just “fileprivate is allowed inside private types” and then “fix all the fallout so that the compiler only shouts at you when necessary”. Can you say what the model change is to you?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks for all the feedback.<br>&gt; Jordan<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;

I had thought the gist<br>&gt;&gt; of the discussion was that SE-0025 itself was an explicit break from purely<br>&gt;&gt; lexical scoping, that the proponents of pure lexical scoping were arguing<br>&gt;&gt; against its adoption, and that its acceptance by the core team was a move<br>&gt;&gt; away from purely lexical scoping.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Let me see if I can rephrase the difficulty as I perceive it. I had<br>&gt;&gt; thought that this was an equivalent formulation of the problem that you are<br>&gt;&gt; addressing with the amendment. The interpretation of `private` as a purely<br>&gt;&gt; lexical scope results in the scenario as follows:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 1. I declare `private var foo`<br>&gt;&gt; 2. There are places in code where `foo` is visible but where its access<br>&gt;&gt; level cannot be uttered (e.g., within a nested type, `foo` is not private<br>&gt;&gt; to that nested type, but it is more narrow in scope than fileprivate,<br>&gt;&gt; internal, or public)<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Your proposal is to allow `fileprivate` to be used in place of the<br>&gt;&gt; unutterable access level. This seems like a hack. The necessity for it<br>&gt;&gt; would go away if we stipulated `private` to exclude all places in code<br>&gt;&gt; where `foo` is visible but where its access level cannot be uttered.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; You have this wrong.  It is not that you declare `private var foo` and<br>&gt;&gt; then in specific places it is visible but you can’t utter its access<br>&gt;&gt; control.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The problem is when you use `private` on any construct which introduces a<br>&gt;&gt; scope that contains further declarations.  You cannot utter the default<br>&gt;&gt; access control for the members of that scope.  Here are examples:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; private struct S {<br>&gt;&gt;     var foo: Int<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; private class C {<br>&gt;&gt;     var foo: Int<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; private enum E {<br>&gt;&gt;     var foo: Int { return 42 }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; private extension S {<br>&gt;&gt;     func bar() {}<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; In all of these examples `foo` and `bar` are visible within the top level<br>&gt;&gt; scope, but not outside the file.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Sorry, yes, that is one problem. The related problem I was trying to<br>&gt; describe was this:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt; public struct A {<br>&gt;   private var foo: Int<br>&gt;   internal struct B {<br>&gt;     // I cannot utter the access control for `foo` here<br>&gt;     // and there is nothing I can declare here to be visible<br>&gt;     // exactly where `foo` is visible<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; ```<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Access control is never uttered at *usage* sites.  It is uttered at<br>&gt; *declaration* sites.  By definition of scope-base access control you are<br>&gt; not going to be able to utter the precise visibility level of some visible<br>&gt; declarations at the *usage* sites.

I had<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; thought that this was an equivalent formulation of the problem that you are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; addressing with the amendment.

There are places in code where `foo` is visible but where its access<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; level cannot be uttered (e.g., within a nested type, `foo` is not private<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; to that nested type, but it is more narrow in scope than fileprivate,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; internal, or public)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Your proposal is to allow `fileprivate` to be used in place of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; unutterable access level.

It is not that you declare `private var foo` and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; then in specific places it is visible but you can’t utter its access<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; control.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem is when you use `private` on any construct which introduces<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; a scope that contains further declarations.  You cannot utter the default<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; access control for the members of that scope.  Here are examples:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; private struct S {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     var foo: Int<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; private class C {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     var foo: Int<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; private enum E {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     var foo: Int { return 42 }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; private extension S {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;     func bar() {}<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; In all of these examples `foo` and `bar` are visible within the top<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; level scope, but not outside the file.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Sorry, yes, that is one problem. The related problem I was trying to<br>&gt;&gt; describe was this:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt; public struct A {<br>&gt;&gt;   private var foo: Int<br>&gt;&gt;   internal struct B {<br>&gt;&gt;     // I cannot utter the access control for `foo` here<br>&gt;&gt;     // and there is nothing I can declare here to be visible<br>&gt;&gt;     // exactly where `foo` is visible<br>&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt; ```<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Access control is never uttered at *usage* sites.  It is uttered at<br>&gt;&gt; *declaration* sites.  By definition of scope-base access control you are<br>&gt;&gt; not going to be able to utter the precise visibility level of some visible<br>&gt;&gt; declarations at the *usage* sites.  I don’t see why this is a problem.  It<br>&gt;&gt; is utterability at *declaration* sites that is important.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Sorry, I&#39;m being sloppy here. Inside struct B, I intend to declare things.<br>&gt; Substitute `typealias Foo` for `var foo` and declarations inside struct B<br>&gt; will have trouble with `A.Foo` because of restrictions concerning minimum<br>&gt; visibility.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I don’t understand why you say this.

In *no* case does the unutterable access level correspond to *internal* which is probably why Jordan did not suggest using that.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; -Matthew<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jordan<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution &lt;https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160629/af3f0036/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc3a9ea0c6c870343d9acb4ac3059cdc?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Discussion] A Problem With SE-0025?</strong> from <string>Matthew Johnson</string> &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt;<p>June 29, 2016 at 04:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jun 29, 2016, at 4:12 PM, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Wed, Jun 29, 2016 at 4:07 PM, Jordan Rose &lt;jordan_rose at apple.com &lt;mailto:jordan_rose at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jun 29, 2016, at 14:03, Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com &lt;mailto:xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Wed, Jun 29, 2016 at 3:15 PM, Jordan Rose via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt;wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; &gt; On Jun 29, 2016, at 13:13, Jose Cheyo Jimenez &lt;cheyo at masters3d.com &lt;mailto:cheyo at masters3d.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; I know this might be have been brought up before but<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; why not just disallow the “private&quot; keyword for top level types, extensions etc.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; A fixit could change top level `private` to `fileprivate`.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; I think this is a little less confusing since effectively this is what is happening in the background.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; That doesn’t fix anything for inner types, so it’s a lot less important than the rest of the amendment.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; There actually is an answer to this, which is that the core team expects &#39;private&#39; to be the common keyword, and therefore it’s better if you can use it at the top level and ignore ‘fileprivate’ altogether in most programs.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On second thought, wouldn&#39;t all of this be inapplicable if `private` literally meant visibility *only* within the current declaration, and neither outside it nor inside any nested types, etc.?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Yes, but that&#39;s not very useful:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; public struct Foo {<br>&gt;   private var value: Int = 0<br>&gt;   public func test() {<br>&gt;     print(value) // error<br>&gt;   }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I suppose you could say that nested types are different from nested functions, but then we start getting complexity in a different direction.

I think some there is some confusion around access modifiers vs visibility.  In Swift 2 these always happened to correspond.  That correspondence allowed you to simple copy and paste any access modifier present on a parent scope into a nested declaration and it wouldn’t ever lower the visibility of the member (although it could raise it in the case of `public`).  Further, anywhere an access modifier appeared it referred to the same level of visibility.  <br></p><p>In Swift 3 with the scope-based `private` this is no longer the case - if you copy and paste `private` from a parent scope into a nested declaration it lowers the visibility because `private` is applied in a narrower scope.  The meaning of the access modifier and therefor the visibility level it references depend on the context (scope) in which the modifier appears.  This has caused some confusion.  The fact that the visibility is unutterable exacerbates the confusion.<br></p><p>-Matthew<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; -Michael<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc3a9ea0c6c870343d9acb4ac3059cdc?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Discussion] A Problem With SE-0025?</strong> from <string>Matthew Johnson</string> &lt;matthew at anandabits.com&gt;<p>June 29, 2016 at 05:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On Jun 29, 2016, at 5:17 PM, Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Wed, Jun 29, 2016 at 5:13 PM, Michael Peternell &lt;michael.peternell at gmx.at &lt;mailto:michael.peternell at gmx.at&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Am 29.06.2016 um 23:57 schrieb Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt;:<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; On Wed, Jun 29, 2016 at 4:46 PM, Matthew Johnson &lt;matthew at anandabits.com &lt;mailto:matthew at anandabits.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; On Jun 29, 2016, at 4:19 PM, Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com &lt;mailto:xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; On Wed, Jun 29, 2016 at 4:16 PM, Matthew Johnson &lt;matthew at anandabits.com &lt;mailto:matthew at anandabits.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 29, 2016, at 4:12 PM, Xiaodi Wu via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; On Wed, Jun 29, 2016 at 4:07 PM, Jordan Rose &lt;jordan_rose at apple.com &lt;mailto:jordan_rose at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Jun 29, 2016, at 14:03, Xiaodi Wu &lt;xiaodi.wu at gmail.com &lt;mailto:xiaodi.wu at gmail.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Wed, Jun 29, 2016 at 3:15 PM, Jordan Rose via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org &lt;mailto:swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;&gt;wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; On Jun 29, 2016, at 13:13, Jose Cheyo Jimenez &lt;cheyo at masters3d.com &lt;mailto:cheyo at masters3d.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I know this might be have been brought up before but<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; why not just disallow the “private&quot; keyword for top level types, extensions etc.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A fixit could change top level `private` to `fileprivate`.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I think this is a little less confusing since effectively this is what is happening in the background.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That doesn’t fix anything for inner types, so it’s a lot less important than the rest of the amendment.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There actually is an answer to this, which is that the core team expects &#39;private&#39; to be the common keyword, and therefore it’s better if you can use it at the top level and ignore ‘fileprivate’ altogether in most programs.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On second thought, wouldn&#39;t all of this be inapplicable if `private` literally meant visibility *only* within the current declaration, and neither outside it nor inside any nested types, etc.?<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, but that&#39;s not very useful:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; public struct Foo {<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   private var value: Int = 0<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   public func test() {<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;     print(value) // error<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose you could say that nested types are different from nested functions, but then we start getting complexity in a different direction.

to be the common keyword, and therefore it’s better if you can use it at the top level and ignore ‘fileprivate’ altogether in most programs.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On second thought, wouldn&#39;t all of this be inapplicable if `private` literally meant visibility *only* within the current declaration, and neither outside it nor inside any nested types, etc.?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, but that&#39;s not very useful:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; public struct Foo {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   private var value: Int = 0<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   public func test() {<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     print(value) // error<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; }<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose you could say that nested types are different from nested functions, but then we start getting complexity in a different direction. And it still doesn&#39;t fix the default access within a private type.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me offer a principled rule: if I write `private var foo`, then `foo` is invisible at such places within the declaration where writing `private var bar` at the same place would cause `bar` to be visible where `foo` is not or vice versa.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This violates the principle behind all of Swift’s access control rules.  That principle is that access control is strictly based on a hierarchy of lexical scopes.  This is a really great principle and is what makes Swift’s access control better than any other I know of (IMO of course).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But however you slice it, some principle of Swift&#39;s access control rules is violated by `private`. If `foo` is visible in a place where I cannot write `private var bar` to mean the same visibility, then the access level of `foo` is unutterable in that location, which is unprecedented as well.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don’t think utterability was a conscious principle to the degree that scope based access control was.  If that was the case the issue would surely have been identified during review.  It wasn’t until Robert started the implementation that anyone (AFAIK) notices that the proposal introduces unutterable visibility in some cases.  Utterability just isn’t something people were thinking about until then.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; But you are right that unutterability is unprecedented and I think everyone agrees that it poses problems which is why Jordan and Robert have amended the proposal to make the visibility members of private types without explicit access control utterable.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The solution we want is to preserve *both* of these principles, not change which one were violating. :)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; If a private member must be visible within a nested type, then that access level necessarily becomes unutterable within the nested type unless we introduce another keyword, which is out of scope without a new proposal. There is no squaring the circle to be had. The amendment, to my understanding, simply hacks around this issue to make `private` nonetheless useful by allowing `fileprivate` things inside `private` things, but in so doing we&#39;re enshrining which of these principles we&#39;re violating, not finding a solution that avoids violating them.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Do you mean a third principle which says something like “a member shall not have a higher access level than its parent”.  If so, you are correct that Jordan’s amendment does violate that and another proposal would be necessary to give it a name that does not exist today.  I don’ think that&#39;s going to happen for Swift 3.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; No, not exactly what I mean, but that is a concern. Jordan&#39;s proposal introduces a dichotomy between the actual access level (i.e. the answer to the question, which code can see this member?) and the access modifier which is used in conjunction with the member (which would become `fileprivate`). So yes, I can utter something, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the question &quot;which code can actually see this member?&quot; still has no utterable answer.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The dichotomy is already implied by the semantics of SE-0025, it just left the visibility unutterable.  Jordan’s amendment makes `fileprivate` have context / scope sensitive semantics which makes the answer utterable.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Yes, I see your point now. It took me this long to understand what was being proposed because the name &quot;fileprivate&quot; explicitly disavows context-sensitive semantics. With this amendment, `fileprivate` will definitely need a renaming because it will neither be private nor scoped to file.<br></p><p>I think Jordan suggested it could be renamed after Swift 3 is out if we find a compellingly better name, it will just require a cycle of deprecation and then removal for `fileprivate`.<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; The only way I can think of to make a scope-dependent visibility level *precisely* utterable everywhere within the relevant scope would be to introduce modifiers like `private(Foo)` where `Foo` is a parent scope.  If you want it to be *precisely* utterable you could consider proposing something along these lines after Swift 3 is out.  Any proposal along these lines would need to consider how to handle extensions since those don’t have names and would also need to handle degenerate cases such as `Foo` within `Foo` within `Foo`.<br>&gt;

I believe this is the right basic approach for formalizing the language rules here:<br></p><p>1. A scope S has access to a declaration D if S has access to the scope S_D in which D is declared and:<br>  - if D is explicitly declared &#39;private&#39;, S is equal to S_D or lexically nested within S_D,<br>  - if D is explicitly declared &#39;fileprivate&#39;, S appears within the same file as S_D,<br>  - if D is explicitly declared &#39;internal&#39;, S appears within the same module as S_D, or<br>  - if D lacks an explicit access specifier, S appears within the same module as S_D or S_D is a public extension (*).<br>(*) I believe this special case rule about public extensions is correct for the current model.  I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good idea, though.<br></p><p>2. A scope S has access to a scope T if:<br>  - S is equal to T or is lexically nested within it,<br>  - T is a declaration D and S has access to D, or<br>  - T is a file scope.<br></p><p>3. A declaration D shall not use in its signature any declaration D_sig for which there potentially exists a scope S such that S has access to D but not D_sig.  The signature of a declaration includes:<br>  - the explicit type of a function, initializer, variable, or constant declaration; or its inferred type (fully &quot;desugared&quot;, e.g. ignoring all type aliases) if an explicit type is not given<br>  - the underlying type of a typealias or associatedtype declaration<br>  - the superclass type of a class declaration<br>  - the conformance list of a class, struct, enum, protocol, or extension declaration<br>  - the generic parameters and constraints of a generic declaration<br>  - etc.<br></p><p>Formally, there&#39;s no need to decide the &quot;real&quot; or &quot;effective&quot; access modifier for a declaration.  Conveniently (and not coincidentally), these rules do end up being equivalent to computing an effective access level by just merging information down from the lexical container, but that&#39;s emergent, not fundamental, so don&#39;t put too much energy into whether the emergent access level &quot;makes sense&quot; as a description.<br></p><p>John.<br></p><p>&gt;  <br>&gt; Jordan<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Jun 29, 2016, at 16:51, Jordan Rose &lt;jordan_rose at apple.com &lt;mailto:jordan_rose at apple.com&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I just attended a core team meeting where this whole thing was discussed, and will update our amendment &lt;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/383&gt; tonight.

The problem is that when we generate the initializer for a private type it is invisible to those outside its scope (which is, by definition, everybody else).
