We don&#39;t want to ship an Xcode package with Swift and SDKs that don&#39;t play well together. (Those of you in bleeding-edge open source land are not so lucky…)  For this feature there are feasible adoption paths even if the SDK updates slowly so we should be okay.<br></p><p>If we can&#39;t get enough of the SDK to adapt in time then we can make the change in stages, deferring complete adoption until the SDK can catch up. For this feature one interim measure would be to temporarily accept both @warn_unused_result and @discardable, add a temporary compiler flag to choose what the default is for unmarked functions, and set the flag to the old way by default. Then the new SDK could update their code while the old SDK still works. Once the SDK was ready we could remove @warn_unused_result and the compiler flag. <br></p><p>A simpler staged adoption would be to temporarily accept both @warn_unused_default and @discardable, but ignore them both. The downside there is that we would temporarily get no unused result warnings at all, which sounds bad.<br></p><p>In any case the problem of SDK malleability is not a show-stopper for acceptance of this proposal.

Community review has convinced us that simply removing the existing attributes from Swift code will not be the best solution for all developers. <br></p><p>For many developers, removing @warn_unused_result will be sufficient, enabling warnings to drive code audits. Deprecating @warn_unused_result instead of remove-on-migration, would better allow inspection of any code that is not @warn_unused_result.<br></p><p>Some developers have requested an on-demand inversion (marking un-marked functions) for code they believe is well audited and will resist any issues with masking inherent problems. Brent Royal-Gordan wrote, &quot;If you have done a reasonably thorough audit, deleting the annotations instead of inverting them is a destructive change. When Swift 2 changed the documentation format, the migrator didn&#39;t delete all the old doc comments. Deleting @warn_unused_result in audited codebases is akin to that.&quot;<br></p><p>Concerns were raised over imported functions written in discardable-by-default environments, especially for C-language sources where community members felt imported functions should match the default behavior of the C-language. Global functions that return scalar values from Objective-C sources might be treated in the same way. We believe any Objective-C method or function that returns an NSObject should warn on ignored result unless explicitly marked.  removeLast() and other pop()-like functions are examples of functions that will most probably be marked with @discartableResult attribute. <br></p><p><br> &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/05f7815cdb7e644062f5#non-migration-concerns&gt;Non-migration concerns:<br></p><p>In Swift Evolution discussions, the term @discardable was mildly preferred over @discardableResult.<br></p><p>Some community members requested a new attribute enabling exceptional imported functions to be properly annotated from Objective-C source.<br></p><p>Dany St-Amant requested two levels of compiler response: @discardableResult(warn) for simple warnings and @discardableResult(critical) which generates an error with unused results, such as when returning allocated resources.<br></p><p><br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160321/a2ddc71b/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d4fb9162c777a5d6d0b1fb00893d709?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0047 Defaulting non-Void functions so they warn on unused results</strong> from <string>Haravikk</string> &lt;swift-evolution at haravikk.me&gt;<p>March 21, 2016 at 09:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; On 21 Mar 2016, at 20:35, Erica Sadun via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; In Swift Evolution discussions, the term @discardable was mildly preferred over @discardableResult.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Some community members requested a new attribute enabling exceptional imported functions to be properly annotated from Objective-C source.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Dany St-Amant requested two levels of compiler response: @discardableResult(warn) for simple warnings and @discardableResult(critical) which generates an error with unused results, such as when returning allocated resources<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br></p><p>This looks good, I think that @discardableResult() makes sense until we can get @discardable on the return type itself.

The most obvious examples are the popViewController methods on UINavigationController — it’s very common, probably more common than not, to ignore the return value of these methods, but it would be unfortunate to need to explicitly ignore the results. (I suppose a counter argument here is that a lot of people may not even realize that those methods have a return value, but even if that’s the case, I suspect the typical pattern is to ignore the return.)<br></p><p>Assuming that most common APIs are audited (and that APIs like popViewController methods would be marked as discardable), then I think the proposal would have a positive impact. Perhaps one way to figure out the scope of the auditing would be to determine how many Apple SDK methods that return values aren’t already marked as warn_unused_result.<br></p><p><br>&gt; On Mar 16, 2016, at 3:36 PM, Chris Lattner via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The review of “Defaulting non-Void functions so they warn on unused results” begins now and runs through March 21, 2016.

It is one of the few aspects of Ruby that I dislike, and it causes no end of frustration. However, this enforces a policy while allowing a opt-out behavior, which is a plus.

I think the default is right for code that was written directly in Swift, but for C and Objective-C code that was written in discartable-by-default environment, the APIs were designed with discardable results that in mind.<br></p><p>I also think it is imperative that the attribute is put just before the return type. Placing the attribute near the return type helps with the discoverability of the feature, which is important. It also makes it easier not to forget the attribute when adding a return type, which will reduce annoyances later.<br></p><p><br>&gt; Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to Swift?<br>&gt; Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br></p><p>Maybe, but I&#39;m not sure. It might cause annoyances for people who aren&#39;t aware of the feature. Either they&#39;ll feel forced to use &quot;_ = foo()&quot; repeatedly (what the compiler will suggest to them), or they&#39;ll feel annoyed enough that they&#39;ll just remove the return value from the function. So whether this is a convenience or an inconvenience depends entirely on people&#39;s awareness of the feature.<br></p><p><br>&gt; How much effort did you put into your review?
