In other words, you need to qualify your releases on the new version anyway. This aspect of the patching feature simply forces you to do the work you need to be doing anyway if you&#39;re doing something so dangerous.<br></p><p>Unbetaed snap OS releases *are* a problem, though. Perhaps we could compromise by continuing to apply the patch on OS patch releases, so a patch qualified for 9.0.0 would also apply on 9.0.1. But with minor releases, and certainly major releases, you should always have enough time to requalify your patches, so they shouldn&#39;t automatically carry over.<br></p><p>I really don&#39;t think, though, that we should have open-ended patching as you propose—following @Catfish_Man gives me a lot of empathy for the poor framework engineers who have to deal with our ludicrous hacks.<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
