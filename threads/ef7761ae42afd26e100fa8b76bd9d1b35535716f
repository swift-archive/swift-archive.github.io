They should never share data between them unless specifically allowed to. Service A uses Foundation version A and service B uses version B. Unless service A and B have privileges to communicate they should never use common storage for cookies or preferences. This could allow service A to inappropriately use the stored credentials of service B if they are stored in the same directory. Moreover if the version B of Foundation has some refinement to the storage version of the cookie the file may be incompatible with Foundation A’s reading schema. <br></p><p>In my opinion the directories should be unique to the services running unless they share a system based privilege system that is a common version (e.g. they are allowed to talk to each other and are not sandboxed apart).<br></p><p>Of course some of this could be side-stepped by having the services running as different users.

Foundation should enforce security.<br>&gt;&gt; - On macOS, settings seem to be written to ~/Library/Preferences/$(BUNDLE_ID).plist, and the proposed ~/.foundation/Preferences/EXECUTABLE_NAME.plist isn’t that different.<br>&gt;&gt; ‘.foundation’ is used in lieu of a library directory, and I feel this is acceptable so as not to clash with any user ~/Preferences or ~/Library directory.  I am OK with the ‘Foundation ownership’ per above.<br>&gt;&gt; And, executable name seems reasonable in lieu of bundle ID.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I noted something like ~/.foundation/Library/Preferences/EXECUTABLE_NAME.plist may be desirable to keep symmetry/reuse more CF code, but changing Swift CF is probably necessary anyway and better (fewer search paths to loop through, possibly less I/O).<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Agreed, I don’t have any problem with baking a set of rules into CF that is specific to various platforms. That’s it’s job after all.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Am interested in alternatives of course :-)<br>&gt;&gt; - But having separate folders for each app seems complicated, ex. &#39;~/.app1/Preferences’ ‘~/.app2/Preferences’ pollutes home.<br>&gt;&gt; - I don’t really mind the name of an encapsulating folder, .foundation or otherwise.<br>&gt;&gt; - Placing system configuration files in /etc is a norm, but I think I’d feel more comfortable with Swift app settings in /home/user (easier to keep track of, and I can delete the whole thing without consequences*). I’m also not writing any real low-level services in Swift… but others probably are… but they probably have their own code to write config data to /etc!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Off-list, someone pointed me here:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html<br>&gt;<br>&gt; and here:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1024114/location-of-ini-config-files-in-linux-unix<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Noting that there seems to be a growing consensus for $HOME/.config.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Is this spec beginning to be used in the real world?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - Tony<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; To Philippe’s points about security+future-proofing:<br>&gt;&gt; Perhaps the cookie file could be named per version of its format:<br>&gt;&gt; ~/.foundation/Cookies/shared initially<br>&gt;&gt; When we have a new format:<br>&gt;&gt; ~/.foundation/Cookies/shared2, shared3, etc? Or even pick a new name entirely?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I also think it should be up to Swift Foundation to enforce cookie security on a per-app/family basis (the latter requires changes to the package structure?).<br>&gt;&gt; Perhaps for now, it is possible to save the hash and name of the executable storing a cookie? And Foundation can load cookie storage only if the executable name and file haven’t changed? (Is that an unnecessary pain?)<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Regards,<br>&gt;&gt; Will Stanton<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; On Nov 14, 2016, at 12:44 PM, Tony Parker &lt;anthony.parker at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Isn’t it a bit odd to use ‘.foundation’ as the name of the directory, when Foundation is just one of the libraries involved?
