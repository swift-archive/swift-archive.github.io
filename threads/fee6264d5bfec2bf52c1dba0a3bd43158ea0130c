If “doXWithY(_ y: Y)” gets renamed to “doX(with y: Y)” and Y happened to be a enum or have static members, at use site it become a little awkward. Following Brandon’s first example:<br></p><p>1. “normal” is an adjective, and preposition followed by adjective (“for normal”, “to default”, “with misc”) is ungrammatical. It’s very common to have enum cases being an adjective.<br>2. if the argument is a literal value (as opposed to a variable), the type information is not immediately obvious at use site. The function reads better if the enum type prefix is preserved: `botton.setTitle(“Test”, for: UIControlState.normal)`.<br></p><p>In these cases, we chose to preserve the words after the preposition to make the call site clearer.<br></p><p>These aren’t problems from the API Design Guideline.
