He made sure to call out any breaking changes (this was pre-1.0 so there were breaking changes almost every week) as well as anything that seemed like it would be of interest to people looking for a weekly summary. He also listed RFCs (Rust&#39;s equivalent for our swift-evolution proposals) as well as any interesting news from the community (such as new projects or libraries). This weekly newsletter was posted on his blog and also posted on the Rust mailing list. I&#39;m really not sure where he got all the time to do this (I believe he was studying at University at the time), and I don&#39;t know how much time it actually took, but it was widely regarded as being extremely helpful.<br></p><p>I&#39;d really love to see someone with enough time on their hands start up something similar for Swift. This would include interesting or important changes to the language/stdlib as well as news about proposals (e.g. newly-submitted ones, ones up for review in the coming week, the accepted/rejected resolution of them, and finally news about when implementations get merged in). Ideally, Apple would actually pay someone to do this, but I suspect it&#39;s unlikely that there&#39;s anyone involved with Swift at Apple that has the time for something like this.
