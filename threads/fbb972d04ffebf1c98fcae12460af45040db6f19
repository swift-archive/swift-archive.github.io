The trickiest part comes down to synthesizing the right declaration (basically, creating what the user should have written) so it can be presented to the user in the Fix-It text. We actually have some code that does something similar. Try this in Xcode:<br></p><p>class A {<br>  required init(x: Int, y: String) { }<br>}<br></p><p>class B : A {<br>  init() {<br>    super.init(x: 5, y: &quot;hello&quot;)<br>  }<br>}<br></p><p>and you get a Fix-It that adds the missing required initializer:<br></p><p>  required init(x: Int, y: String) {<br>    fatalError(&quot;init(x:y:) has not been implemented&quot;)<br>  }<br></p><p>(That’s lib/Sema/TypeCheckDecl.cpp’s diagnoseMissingRequiredInitializer(), FWIW).<br></p><p>	- Doug<br></p><p><br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/attachments/20160420/da7147c6/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
