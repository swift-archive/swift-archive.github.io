But that seems to be so hacky and a even worse solution, so we discarded the way to  provider several indepentent small util binaries.<br></p><p>Instead of that we changed to one binard which could be symlinked on the target machine, checking the symlink name from which the binary was invoked, and instancing indivudial &quot;BinaryInstance&quot; classes which do the argument/work splitting.
