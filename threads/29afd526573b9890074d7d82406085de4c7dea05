The proposal is available here:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;  <br>&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0120-revise-partition-method.md <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Reviews are an important part of the Swift evolution process. All <br>&gt; reviews should be sent to the swift-evolution mailing list at<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>&gt; or, if you would like to keep your feedback private, directly to the <br>&gt; review manager.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What goes into a review?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review <br>&gt; through constructive criticism and contribute to the direction of <br>&gt; Swift. When writing your review, here are some questions you might want <br>&gt; to answer in your review:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	* What is your evaluation of the proposal?<br>&gt; 	* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a <br>&gt; change to Swift?<br>&gt; 	* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of Swift?<br>&gt; 	* If you have used other languages or libraries with a similar <br>&gt; feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?<br>&gt; 	* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick <br>&gt; reading, or an in-depth study?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; More information about the Swift evolution process is available at<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/process.md<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thank you,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -Chris Lattner<br>&gt; Review Manager<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p><p><br>-- <br>Károly<br>@lorentey<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
