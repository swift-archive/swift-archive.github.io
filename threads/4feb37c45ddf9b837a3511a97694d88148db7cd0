I must say that I am very happy for what has been discussed, the<br>more because of what Swift will *not* become than of what it will become.<br>;-)<br></p><p>OK. In Objective-C and other languages we have “.PCH” files or some kind of<br>“prefix headers”. In Swift we do not have header files (thankfully), but<br>there is no simple way to “pre-import” modules in a way that all source<br>files can “see” them without the need of a big list of “imports” at the<br>beginning of each file, every single time. I know that the “.PCH-like” it<br>is not a good practice in most cases, but I believe it would be interesting<br>in some other cases.<br></p><p>Today we have some kind of this functionality when using bridging headers,<br>but this is in fact a side effect provided by the interoperability with<br>Objective-C. I am suggesting a pure Swift version of this functionality.<br></p><p>I do not know how we can implement this in Swift, but since we now have the<br>special case of “Package.swift” to handling SPM things, maybe something<br>like “Preimport.swift” or “Modules.swift” or something better than these<br>names (I do not like them…) with the intention of saying: “Hi, compiler!<br>I&#39;m listing here the modules that are common to the whole project, OK? Can<br>you take them into account when compiling each project source code file<br>from now?&quot;<br></p><p>What do you think?<br></p><p>Regards,<br></p><p>Vanderlei Martinelli<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160126/4feb7cd0/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
