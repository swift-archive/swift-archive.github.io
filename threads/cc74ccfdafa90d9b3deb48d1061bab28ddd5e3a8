A class defines a type and it defines storage. An instance is of a certain type and puts specific values in the storage. An instance or value is a realization of a class or type. If I have an instance or value, I can ask it to tell me its type. I can store that type in a variable. There is also a notation to allow me to specify any such type as a literal.<br></p><p>Just as I can programmatically refer to the type of an value (or the class of an object instance), I&#39;d like to be able to refer to a case in the abstract without also needing to supply associated values.  But that&#39;s not possible; an enum case that is declared with associated values can&#39;t exist in any form unless and until those values are specified.<br></p><p>Perhaps an example will help. Assume the following enum representing the universe of screens that can be displayed in an app:<br></p><p>enum Screens<br>{<br>    case Splash<br>    case Landing<br>    case UserPreferences(User)<br>    case StoreView(Store)<br>    case SaleView(Sale)<br>    case ProductView(Product)<br>}<br></p><p>Some of the cases have associated values, some do not.

So I can&#39;t add a &quot;func allScreens() -&gt; [Screens]&quot; to the enum to allow me to query for this information.<br></p><p>The simplest work-around for this use case seems to be creating a parallel enum like:<br></p><p>enum ScreenTypes<br>{<br>    case Splash<br>    case Landing<br>    case UserPreferences<br>    case StoreView<br>    case SaleView<br>    case ProductView<br></p><p>    func allScreens() -&gt; [ScreenTypes]<br>}<br></p><p>With such an enum, I could populate a debug menu.<br></p><p>Several times now when I&#39;ve used enums that have associated values, I&#39;ve wished for a parallel enum that had the same cases, but without associated values, so I could do things like that. I usually end of creating one, but then I lose the ability to have the compiler flag a whole class of errors.<br></p><p>Does my explanation make sense?<br></p><p>All the best,<br>E.<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20151210/faeef86e/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/abf891ba571d5a819ddf547917abe1e1?s=50"></div><header><strong>Request: Ability to refer to an enum case in abstract (without its associated value)</strong> from <string>Al Skipp</string> &lt;al_skipp at fastmail.fm&gt;<p>December 11, 2015 at 12:00:00pm</p></header><div class="content"><p>I don’t think this suggestion would work in practice.

It’s the equivalent of trying to construct a struct value with non-optional properties, but without providing any init parameters, it would result in an invalid value.

You can only create a value in the specific form, i.e. the form of the case that actually contains the associated values. There&#39;s no way to represent the general form.<br></p><p>Bear with my inaccurate analogy here, because it might provide a better explanation of what I&#39;m talking about:<br></p><p>In an enum, when a case has no associated values, you can think of values of that case behaving like a type in that there&#39;s only one version of it that can exist: the thing itself. There&#39;s no range of values that can be represented by such an enum case; there&#39;s just one value.<br></p><p>Now, once you introduce associated values, the concept of an enum case suddenly changes: it no longer represents a single thing, it represents a potential range of things. In other words, realized versions of those case values stop acting like types and start acting like instances of a type.<br></p><p>Anywhere else in Swift where something acts like a value, there&#39;s an equivalent metavalue type that can also be represented in a Swift variable.<br></p><p>Why would I want to do this?<br></p><p>It seems to me it&#39;s quite common in software development that when you model specific instances of things, you also need a way to represent the general form of those specific things.<br></p><p>In my case, I want to model a set of screens with specific content, I might do that with an enum containing associated values. The case represents the screen, and the associated values represent the content.<br></p><p>However, in addition to representing the specific, I also need to model the general. Instead of modeling screens with specific content, I also need to programmatically model just the screens themselves, without any specific content.<br></p><p>My solution was to allow such enums to opt-in to a protocol that would cause the compiler to generate a parallel enum that contains the same cases, minus the associated values.<br></p><p>This parallel enum would be an entirely different type, and it would not affect the current semantics of the original enum (with the associated values) that it &quot;shadows&quot;.<br></p><p>I&#39;ve run into several use cases for this in about a year of Swift coding, and each time I&#39;ve come up with a manual work-around (just as others have suggested various ways to work around this) but in each case, I lose the compiler&#39;s ability to enforce the conditions that I must now assert at runtime.<br></p><p>E.<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>Request: Ability to refer to an enum case in abstract (without its associated value)</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>December 11, 2015 at 06:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; With such an enum, I could populate a debug menu.<br></p><p>If you just want this for debugging, have you looked at the reflection APIs?<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div><ul class="comments"><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76dd8f23593c1a1f5c57cc6a8982d726?s=50"></div><header><strong>Request: Ability to refer to an enum case in abstract (without its associated value)</strong> from <string>Brent Royal-Gordon</string> &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt;<p>December 11, 2015 at 06:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; If you just want this for debugging, have you looked at the reflection APIs?<br></p><p>Sorry, that’s probably not suitable for your specific use case.<br></p><p>Honestly, I really do think you’re confusing two separate issues: testing which screen you’re on, and navigating to a particular screen. You can test which screen you’re on without paying attention to the specific associated values. But if you then want to navigate to a screen, you’re going to need the associated values anyway. Why would you want a version of your enum which didn’t have them?<br></p><p>(By the way, if your answer is “I want to map meta-enum values to the enum value I’m currently using”, then write a Hashable conformance which ignores the associated values. Then looking up .Foo(a) in a Dictionary will give you .Foo(b) if that’s present instead.)<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
