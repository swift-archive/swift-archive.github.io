Now that Swift has a built-in package manager (including static lib creation), this is already possible today with just a few wrappers to invoke the compiling and running. Nothing else is really needed from the languages other than core libs implemented for the target platforms and additional libraries to flush out what is missing to make it more useful.<br></p><p>-David<br></p><p>&gt; On Dec 3, 2015, at 3:32 PM, Chris Lattner &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On Dec 3, 2015, at 3:22 PM, Dave Thornton &lt;dave.thornton at me.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Swift is great.
