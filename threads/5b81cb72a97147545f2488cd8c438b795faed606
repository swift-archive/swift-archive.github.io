I only use classes where a common reference is<br>&gt;&gt; absolutely necessary, and also for nested types.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It seems to me that you are using classes and structs in exactly the<br>&gt; right way. However, I don&#39;t think your judicious use of classes is<br>&gt; necessarily an argument that &quot;classes are second-class citizens in<br>&gt; Swift&quot;.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Sometimes classes are the right tool for the job. Sometimes structs or enums are.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What I love about Swift is that it&#39;s often much easier to use the<br>&gt; right tool for the right job than other languages.
