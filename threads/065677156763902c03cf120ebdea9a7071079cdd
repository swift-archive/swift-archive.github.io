If no custom summary is<br>&gt;&gt; provided, the summary would default to the string produced by calling<br>&gt;&gt; String(reflecting: subject) on the subject at the time of mirror creation.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Some context: right now, there are two APIs for mirrors in the standard<br>&gt;&gt; library: CustomReflectable, which is publicly exposed and relies on the<br>&gt;&gt; conforming type creating a Mirror object, and _Reflectable, which relies on<br>&gt;&gt; the conforming type having a companion type conforming to _MirrorType. A<br>&gt;&gt; short-term goal is to migrate the standard library&#39;s types off the<br>&gt;&gt; _Reflectable API and have them use the CustomReflectable API, and changing<br>&gt;&gt; dump() accordingly.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The extant implementation of dump() uses a property on _MirrorType called<br>&gt;&gt; &quot;summary&quot;. (This is where e.g. &quot;4 elements&quot; comes from when you dump() an<br>&gt;&gt; array.) &quot;summary&quot; is absent from Mirror or any types related to<br>&gt;&gt; CustomReflectable. I asked Joe Groff about this and the rationale was that<br>&gt;&gt; it was deemed too similar to debugDescription (or String(reflecting: foo))<br>&gt;&gt; to be worth carrying over.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I would like to suggest that there might be a purpose for &quot;summary&quot;:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; - Types with children, especially container types like arrays, often<br>&gt;&gt; print out a description of their children as part of their debugDescription<br>&gt;&gt; or description, redundant when using an API like dump() which provides a<br>&gt;&gt; structural representation of the children of the subject. In such cases a<br>&gt;&gt; lighter-weight description (like &quot;3 elements&quot;) might be more appropriate to<br>&gt;&gt; represent to the user.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; - Certain types like CGRect don&#39;t conform to CustomStringConvertible,<br>&gt;&gt; CustomDebugStringConvertible, Streamable, etc. Having a custom summary for<br>&gt;&gt; these types customized by the corresponding Mirror would allow for a<br>&gt;&gt; &#39;pretty&#39; representation during reflection in lieu of the ugly one generated<br>&gt;&gt; by the runtime without making more substantial changes to the API which<br>&gt;&gt; might break third-party code (such as conforming CGRect to any of the<br>&gt;&gt; aforementioned protocols).<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I know that Mirror (and reflection as a whole) are being considered for<br>&gt;&gt; major design changes, so this would be a minor transient change to make the<br>&gt;&gt; API easier to work with in the meantime.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Please let me know whether or not you think this proposed change is<br>&gt;&gt; meaningful and worthwhile, or if you have any questions.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Best,<br>&gt;&gt; Austin<br>&gt;&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;  _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -Dave<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160105/98744620/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
