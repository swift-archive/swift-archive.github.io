The proposal has been *rejected*.<br></p><p>The majority of the feedback on this proposal was opposed to it, because it makes the Swift language complex for a single library.  While it is unfortunate that this library is out in the wild and that there are some users, it was never intended for a single dollar sign to be allowed as an identifier, and it was also never documented as such.  The core team believes that Swift 3 compatibility mode will be able to cleanly handle compatibility issues implied by not accepting this proposal.<br></p><p>Thank you to Ankur Patel for raising this proposal: it was important to get proper community discussion and feedback on this topic.<br></p><p>-Chris Lattner<br>Review Manager<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
