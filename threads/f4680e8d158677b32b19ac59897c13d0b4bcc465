What meaning does it imply to you?<br></p><p>&gt; Swift is not Objective-C. Even if it shares the concept that method<br>&gt; and parameter names form the signature, the parentheses declaration<br>&gt; and call syntax (modeled on C languages) increases the visual and<br>&gt; semantic separation between method and parameter names.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That&#39;s why, the way I see it, method names should stand on their own,<br>&gt; without the help of parameter names. I should be able to read the<br>&gt; method calls without the parameter names (like in C) and still<br>&gt; understand the basic idea:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; a.dismiss(true)<br>&gt; a.dismissAnimated(true)<br>&gt; a.tracksWithMediaType(b, c)<br>&gt; a.move(b, c)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; All these calls, as often seen in C-based languages, are much more<br>&gt; ambiguous without their parameter names, but still read fine. <br></p><p>I understand your philosophy, but I disagree with it (I also don&#39;t agree<br>that any of the above “read fine” for their intended semantics).  Swift<br>lets API designers specify argument labels that are required at the call<br>site because of a fundamental belief that it makes for better code. This<br>is a core idea in Swift&#39;s design.  IMO, asking API designers to write<br>code as though the argument labels could be omitted at the call site<br>would be making their life needlessly difficult.  It would also be out<br>of touch with reality, since after all the labels *can&#39;t* be omitted.<br></p><p>&gt; But:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; a.moveFrom(b, c)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This reads much worse.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I&#39;m sorry, I feel like I&#39;m bad at explaining my reasoning. <br></p><p>I am forced to agree, here.<br></p><p>&gt; One rule I&#39;d like to see is that the method name before the<br>&gt; parentheses should read fine without the parameter names. That they<br>&gt; should come as a nice addition to document and disambiguate.<br></p><p>Noted. I won&#39;t be proposing that rule, since I disagree with it, but you<br>can always propose an amendment to the guidelines we end up with and see<br>how it flies.<br></p><p><br>-- <br>-Dave<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
