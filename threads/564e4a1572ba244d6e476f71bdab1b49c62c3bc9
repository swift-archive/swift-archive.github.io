Currently I’m able to compile clang, swift, the standard library, llbuild and lldb (although lldb doesn’t seem to be able to find any symbols right now, so it can pause and step through processes, but can’t set breakpoints or start the REPL — it’s a work in progress).<br></p><p>See my mail to swift-dev: http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.devel/1966 &lt;http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.devel/1966&gt;<br>Note that initially my target triple was wrong; you should make binutils for &quot;arm-linux-gnueabihf”, and you should edit “build_toolchain.sh” and “build_common.sh”, not install_toolchain and install_common (they don’t exist anyway).<br></p><p>I’ve been doing it from a Mac, but I’d love to hear if you can replicate it from linux.<br></p><p>Karl<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/attachments/20160512/bfb98cc8/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
