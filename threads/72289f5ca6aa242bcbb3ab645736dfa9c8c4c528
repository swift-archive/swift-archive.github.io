You would probably like indentation for nesting as well in the generated code, so there is already reason to write a little helper (let’s call it IndentingWriter) or maybe use a full blown framework for pretty printing (e.g. like Haskell’s Text.PrettyPrint, see https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/pretty-1.1.2.0/Text-PrettyPrint.html).<br></p><p>-Thorsten<br></p><p><br>&gt; <br>&gt; Code that is written by other code always has a strong incentive to avoid raising any compiler error/warnings, and so tends not to be read as much by humans who might think there&#39;s a missing item after the last extra comma.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; How about a syntax warning/error for only those trailing commas that end a line that contains a previous comma serving the same syntactic function at the same syntactic level?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Doug McKenna<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
