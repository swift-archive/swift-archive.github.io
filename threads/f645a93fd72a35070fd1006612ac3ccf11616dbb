Under this proposal, the longer an argument list <br>&gt;&gt; gets, the further separated the constraints are from the type <br>&gt;&gt; parameters that use them.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This is partly an issue of how you use the feature rather than an issue <br>&gt; with the feature itself, as you’re assuming that everything is all on <br>&gt; one line, but really I think the intent of this feature is to better <br>&gt; support multi-line declarations. It enables things like:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	func someMethod&lt;S:SequenceType, T&gt;(value:S) -&gt; AnySequence&lt;T&gt;<br>&gt; 		where S.Generator.Element == T { … }<br></p><p>I&#39;m not assuming that.

Not all constraints fit that <br>mold—some encode very important information that it makes sense to keep <br>up front.<br></p><p><br>&gt; This is partly why I’d prefer to see it optional though, as some things <br>&gt; will fit on one line reasonably well (you probably could with the above <br>&gt; for example), but like you say, with it all on one line the return type <br>&gt; becomes less visible.<br></p><p>No matter how you format the proposed syntax, the return type is <br>sandwiched in the middle of two things that describe generic type <br>information—whether it&#39;s on one line or not doesn&#39;t change that. I <br>believe that harms readability, especially if you have some constraints <br>(conformance) on the left and some (associated types) on the right.<br></p><p>I would be strongly opposed to making this optional—that adds <br>complexity to the language to support parsing two patterns, as well as <br>the cognitive load of someone reading Swift code, especially if written <br>in the different style.

What&#39;s not to like about this idea?<br></p><p>There is a lot not to like about the idea; even if it was optional. Personally, I feel the problem is solved in a much, much more elegant manner by other proposals.<br></p><p>Firstly, the stuff after the ‘where’ clause is getting shorter once typealiases come to protocols. C.Iterator.Element become C.Element. In this one example, that’s 18 characters down to 9 - a 50% reduction in length. We tend to use quite expressive names for associated types, so I expect we’ll see similar gains elsewhere from this very simple proposal.<br></p><p>Not only that, but there’s a very good proposal to add ‘where’ clauses to associated types in the protocols themselves, which will likely further reduce the verbosity of the constraints you need to specify at each declaration site. https://github.com/hartbit/swift-evolution/blob/9acd75abfbe626bbb3f9458cc3f6edb1d1f88c95/proposals/XXXX-associated-types-constraints.md &lt;https://github.com/hartbit/swift-evolution/blob/9acd75abfbe626bbb3f9458cc3f6edb1d1f88c95/proposals/XXXX-associated-types-constraints.md&gt;<br></p><p>And then we have generic typealiases and generalised existentials, which would allow us to wrap those ‘where’ clauses in to something much more intelligible to a human being at first glance. ‘StringCollection’ or ‘CollectionOfStrings’ is much clearer than &lt;C:Collection where C.Element==String&gt;, no matter how you chop it up.<br></p><p>If I look at the other proposals, and where we are headed with much more expressive typealiases and associated types, I just feel that that’s the future: that’s the “swift’ way. It’s like type inference - all of the strict constraints are still there under-the-hood, but you’re able to work at a much clearer and more obvious abstraction level. This proposal pulls us further away from things like ‘obviousness’, and like I said, simply feels like an inelegant solution.<br></p><p>At the very least, I think we should shelve the discussion until the larger expansion of typealiases, etc is complete. We should re-evaluate at that time, with a bigger set of more general-purpose tools to produce readable code.<br></p><p><br>&gt; On 14 May 2016, at 22:28, L.

I’ve used C# for many many years, which has its where clause at the end of the declaration (like this proposal), and I’ve used Swift since its unveiling. The experience with using both styles for several years makes me favour this proposal’s syntax because I find it much easier to read and format for readability.<br></p><p>Constraints on associated type will provide more expressivity but I doubt it will greatly reduce protocol constraint clauses in a majority of cases.

I’ve used C# for many many years, which has its where clause at the end of the declaration (like this proposal), and I’ve used Swift since its unveiling. The experience with using both styles for several years makes me favour this proposal’s syntax because I find it much easier to read and format for readability.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Constraints on associated type will provide more expressivity but I doubt it will greatly reduce protocol constraint clauses in a majority of cases.

But that isn&#39;t the whole case because Swift also applies implicit constraints onto any generic parameters that are used in constrained positions. If that wasn&#39;t clearly said, take the following example in Swift 2.x:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     func aMethod&lt;S : SequenceType, T where S.Generator.Element == T&gt;(value: S) -&gt; Set&lt;T&gt; {<br>&gt;         return Set(value)<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That declaration actually makes you wait all the way until the return type `Set&lt;T&gt;` until you learn that `T` must also necessarily be `Hashable`. So I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s that different if the `where` clause isn&#39;t right next to the generic type arguments&#39; introduction:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     func aMethod&lt;S, T&gt;(value: S) -&gt; Set&lt;T&gt; // FWIW, this line contains what I usually have in mind when browsing code.<br>&gt;         where // T : Hashable, // (implicit)<br>&gt;               S : SequenceType,<br>&gt;               S.Generator.Element == T<br>&gt;     {<br>&gt;         return Set(value)<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; — Pyry<br>&gt; <br>&gt; PS. Besides, neither the original example nor mine was really fair; you don&#39;t need `where` for these. Instead, you&#39;d just write:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     func someMethod&lt;S : SequenceType&gt;(value: S) -&gt; AnySequence&lt;S.Generator.Element&gt; {<br>&gt;         ...<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; which SE-0081 has nothing to argue for or against.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160514/f6d19e7a/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85a454a69ee2cf2ac4b990dc9e87b664?s=50"></div><header><strong>[Review] SE-0081: Move where clause to end of declaration</strong> from <string>Thorsten Seitz</string> &lt;tseitz42 at icloud.com&gt;<p>May 16, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>&gt; Am 14.05.2016 um 20:19 schrieb Tony Allevato via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; On 2016-05-14 16:29:40 +0000, Haravikk via swift-evolution said:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; On 14 May 2016, at 16:52, Tony Allevato via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; To me, this makes declarations with complex sets of constraints much harder to read, because I have to hunt them down instead of finding them all in one place. Under this proposal, the longer an argument list gets, the further separated the constraints are from the type parameters that use them.<br>&gt;&gt; This is partly an issue of how you use the feature rather than an issue with the feature itself, as you’re assuming that everything is all on one line, but really I think the intent of this feature is to better support multi-line declarations. It enables things like:<br>&gt;&gt; 	func someMethod&lt;S:SequenceType, T&gt;(value:S) -&gt; AnySequence&lt;T&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; 		where S.Generator.Element == T { … }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;m not assuming that.

Not all constraints fit that mold—some encode very important information that it makes sense to keep up front.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; This is partly why I’d prefer to see it optional though, as some things will fit on one line reasonably well (you probably could with the above for example), but like you say, with it all on one line the return type becomes less visible.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; No matter how you format the proposed syntax, the return type is sandwiched in the middle of two things that describe generic type information—whether it&#39;s on one line or not doesn&#39;t change that. I believe that harms readability, especially if you have some constraints (conformance) on the left and some (associated types) on the right.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I would be strongly opposed to making this optional—that adds complexity to the language to support parsing two patterns, as well as the cognitive load of someone reading Swift code, especially if written in the different style. As was mentioned in another thread, &quot;Swift is an opinionated languge&quot;, and I hope we&#39;d be prescriptive about syntactic constructs like this that are more significant than &quot;does the curly brace go on the same line or the next line&quot;. (Even if the choice is one that I disagree with in the end, I&#39;d rather there be one way than multiple ways!)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt;&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-evolution mailing list<br>&gt; swift-evolution at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-evolution<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
