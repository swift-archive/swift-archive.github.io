As far as I can tell, this is because some iterators *must* provide reference semantics (e.g. when reading from a socket), while others can be implemented perhaps more efficiently with a value type.<br></p><p>How bad would it be to force all iterators to provide reference semantics by making IteratorProtocol a class protocol? Particularly if we assume that iterators could generally be made `final`?<br></p><p>Alternatively, how valuable is it to specify that you can&#39;t use an iterator in a way that would expose whether it is a reference or a value type? The only iterators I can think of which would *need* to be reference types are ones which draw elements from an outside source; for those, it&#39;s unsurprising that copying doesn&#39;t &quot;work&quot;. Are there cases I&#39;m not thinking of?<br></p><p>Or have I totally misread the situation in some way?<br></p><p>-- <br>Brent Royal-Gordon<br>Architechies<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
