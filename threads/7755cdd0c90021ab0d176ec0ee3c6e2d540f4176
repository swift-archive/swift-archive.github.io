How can the user communicate to the compiler that the same memory location is accessed as a different type, particularly when so many users are accustomed to getting away with this in C?<br></p><p>One more point here. The proposed low-level UnsafeRawPointer API is painfully explicit and seemingly redundant when it comes to writing type names in many places. This is intentional. The initial goal is to make the primitive API&#39;s difficult to misuse, but that is not the end goal.<br>Eventually we will provide convenience APIs on top of these primitive APIs. For example, I expect to provide convenience APIs for safely allocating and initializing memory in one step. I also expect to make better use of the UnsafeBufferPointer API in the future.<br></p><p>However, these convenience APIs are purely additive and it&#39;s important that we move forward with source-breaking changes to the primitive API even if some common idioms become more verbose.<br></p><p>-Andy<br></p><p>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello Swift community,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The review of “SE-0107: UnsafeRawPointer API” begins now and runs through July 4, 2016.
