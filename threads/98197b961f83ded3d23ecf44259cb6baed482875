It is very, very unlikely that you will get people to add syntactic<br>&gt; sugar *just* for striding and *just* for the for loop. If this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	for i in (1..&lt;10).striding(by: 2) { … }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Is so ugly that we need special syntactic sugar for it, then so is this:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	(1..&lt;10).striding(by: 2).map { … }<br>&gt; <br></p><p>It&#39;s unnecessarily unwieldy, and I&#39;d prefer `.by(x)`, `.step(x)`, or even<br>`.stride(x)` over `.striding(by: x)` any day. I understand potential<br>reservations towards &quot;by&quot;, even though I don&#39;t share them, but these cannot<br>possibly apply to &quot;step&quot; or &quot;stride&quot;.<br></p><p>&gt; That means we would need an expression along the lines of:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 	1..&lt;10 by 2<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Which could be used anywhere.<br>&gt;<br></p><p>That&#39;s where I disagree. You see, what I&#39;m trying to achieve here is not to<br>fight tooth and claw for an ever shorter step syntax in collections.<br></p><p>I just want to *get rid of an anomaly*, which imo justifies a new keyword<br>for a (heavily utilized) special case.<br></p><p>So far, you can fully use all core control structures in Swift without<br>resorting to methods/protocols, let alone noisy ones. While, While-Repeat,<br>If-Else, Switch, and (plain) For-In all work in a straight forward,<br>imperative, expected way, and that&#39;s highly desirable, because it&#39;s<br>intuitive and comes free of cognitive load.<br></p><p>But by removing (which btw I fully support) the C-style For-loop from the<br>language, suddenly one of the simplest and most primal tasks stands out<br>unpleasantly:<br></p><p>Counting from x to y with a step size of z -- which is the very application<br>the For-loop originally was created for.<br></p><p>Would you like to be forced to work with a While-loop like the one below?<br></p><p>while i.loop(initialize: 1, conditionlessorequal: 10, increaseby: 3)<br> <br>Yeah, me neither ;)<br></p><p>Again: I&#39;m not aiming at collection syntax in general; it just gets in the<br>line of fire, because the only remaining For-loop in Swift currently doesn&#39;t<br>know how to step through a sequence of numbers without making a fuss. <br></p><p>-- Hans<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
