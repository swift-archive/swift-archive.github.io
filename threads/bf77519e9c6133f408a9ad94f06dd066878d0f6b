I&#39;ll be looking forward to participating in more<br>&gt; discussions on this mailing list.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - Brian Gesiak<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Fri, Dec 4, 2015 at 11:24 AM, Mike Ferris &lt; mferris at apple.com &gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; One possible direction to consider which would be more consistent with our<br>&gt; goals this year for API-compatibility would be to look into implementing<br>&gt; XCTestObserver.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Mike<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Dec 3, 2015, at 8:03 PM, Tony Parker &lt; anthony.parker at apple.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hi Brian,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Dec 3, 2015, at 3:45 PM, Brian Gesiak &lt; modocache at gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hello! This is in reference to<br>&gt; https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/3. That pull request<br>&gt; contains a commit that attempts to refactor XCTest such that it is more<br>&gt; &quot;unit-testable”.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Cool, thanks for looking into this area.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; To do so, it gives XCTMain an additional parameter: a list of objects<br>&gt; conforming to the Reporter protocol. I think of this as a minimal, corelibs<br>&gt; equivalent to Apple&#39;s XCTest&#39;s XCTestObserver.h. I say &quot;minimal&quot; because<br>&gt; Reporter only defines Reporter.log(), whereas XCTestObserver has one method<br>&gt; for each kind of test event (started, failed, finished, etc.).<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Do you think it’d be possible to split out the idea of adding this new API<br>&gt; to XCTest from getting some tests for XCTest itself?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The reason I’m asking is that (like Foundation and dispatch), we’re trying<br>&gt; to keep the API surface of this XCTest very similar to the one that ships<br>&gt; today with Xcode. This will help developers who need to integrate their<br>&gt; cross-platform tests into suites that include features that Obj-C XCTest has<br>&gt; that we will probably not add to the Swift one (e.g., UI testing).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; We made a concession to language limitations with the XCTMain function,<br>&gt; because there is no way to dynamically discover all of the test cases. I’d<br>&gt; really like to get rid of it in the long term in favor of something else;<br>&gt; maybe a decoration like @testable that we could find automatically.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - Tony<br>&gt;<br>&gt; These reporters are, for now, storied in a global array. In the future, I&#39;d<br>&gt; like to discuss moving XCTest to a model in which all tests are (optionally)<br>&gt; run in sub-processes, each of which may (optionally) run in parallel. This<br>&gt; global array most certainly won&#39;t work for such a change, but for now, I<br>&gt; simply want to have regression tests on the project. It&#39;s hard to send pull<br>&gt; requests without knowing everything still works!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Besides this approach, which modifies XCTest in order to test it, it may be<br>&gt; more prudent to add tests *without* changing XCTest at all. To do so, I<br>&gt; could add tests that run programs that call XCTMain(), then verify what&#39;s<br>&gt; printed to stdout. This could be done using a Python script (which would go<br>&gt; well with the build script, also in Python).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I&#39;d love input on which of these approaches sounds more viable. Other ideas<br>&gt; are also, of course, welcome!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - Brian Gesiak<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-corelibs-dev mailing list<br>&gt; swift-corelibs-dev at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-corelibs-dev<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>    </main>
