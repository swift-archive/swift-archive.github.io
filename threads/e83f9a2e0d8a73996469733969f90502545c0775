The function takes two Set&lt;String&gt;instances and simply attempts to determine whether all items from Set A are present in Set B (it&#39;s important to note that Set B may well contain additional items).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I&#39;ve attempted to approach the problem in two ways:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; let diff = a.subtracting(b)<br>&gt; guard diff.count == 0 else { return false }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; And also by simply iterating over the contents of Set A, like so:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; for item in a {<br>&gt; if !b.contains(item) {<br>&gt; return false<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Both ultimately end up spending the majority of their time in String._compareDeterministicUnicodeCollaton(String) -&gt;Int. Which makes sense, given what I&#39;m doing - but ideally I&#39;d like to come up with a more efficient way of performing the above check. Swift&#39;s String representation is incredibly robust, but for my needs the strings could be adequately represented in ASCII encoding. I&#39;ve also considered storing and comparing the hashValue of the strings, to speed up comparisons...<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hopefully this is an acceptable question for this mailing list. I&#39;m aware that this may not be a Swift-specific question and could well be solved with a more efficient data structure or approach, but I&#39;d really appreciate some input from more experienced Swift developers :-)_______________________________________________<br>&gt; swift-users mailing list<br>&gt; swift-users at swift.org<br>&gt; https://lists.swift.org/mailman/listinfo/swift-users<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></div>    </main>
