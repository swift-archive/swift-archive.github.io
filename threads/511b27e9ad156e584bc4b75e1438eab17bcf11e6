Because of that, it shows up in code completion as an &quot;appropriate&quot; completion for all values, regardless of whether it makes sense to do so or not. For example, Swift offers 4.dynamicType, myFunction().dynamicType, etc. Rather than express a logical attribute of a specific type, it can be applied to any expression. Since dynamicType behaves more like a operator (like sizeof), its implementation should follow suit.<br></p><p>Moving it to the standard library, allows Swift to remove a keyword and better aligns the functionality with its intended use.<br></p><p> &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/b0155e2f6d96c3d530fdafa9b3bd6272#detailed-design&gt;Detailed Design<br></p><p>Upon adoption of this proposal, Swift removes the dynamicType keyword and introduces a dynamicType function:<br></p><p>dynamicType(value) // returns the dynamicType of value<br> &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/b0155e2f6d96c3d530fdafa9b3bd6272#impact-on-existing-code&gt;Impact on Existing Code<br></p><p>Adopting this proposal will break code and require migration support, moving the postfix property syntax into a prefix function call.<br></p><p> &lt;https://gist.github.com/erica/b0155e2f6d96c3d530fdafa9b3bd6272#alternatives-considered&gt;Alternatives Considered<br></p><p>Not adopting this proposal<br></p><p>-------------- next part --------------<br>An HTML attachment was scrubbed...<br>URL: &lt;https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/attachments/20160520/4f1de590/attachment.html&gt;<br></p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment"><div class="avatar"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09b6a9b66eecf177910c8e47db78d8eb?s=50"></div><header><strong>RFC: didset and willset</strong> from <string>Chris Lattner</string> &lt;clattner at apple.com&gt;<p>May 20, 2016 at 10:00:00am</p></header><div class="content"><p>On May 19, 2016, at 11:34 PM, Brent Royal-Gordon &lt;brent at architechies.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; When we introduce property behaviors, the surface level syntax for this sort of thing is likely to remain the same, and it therefore stands to reason that the behavior “accessors” would follow the same convention as keywords.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Yes, but what will the conventions be?

I&#39;d say no, because in objc it is called &quot;IBOutlet&quot; as well. Also, for my Apple Mail client, &quot;didset&quot; and &quot;willset&quot; are marked as typos, but &quot;didSet&quot; and &quot;willSet&quot; is okay :)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; =&gt; I vote for &quot;didSet&quot; and &quot;willSet&quot;.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I think we should be more careful when trying to argue with &quot;consistency&quot;. It sounds objective, when in reality it&#39;s often very subjective, because Immanuel Kant&#39;s imperative is ambiguous ;) there are multiple ways to be consistent. If you are saying that something is inconsistent, you either assert a specific rule of consistency (like &quot;keywords are always lowercase&quot;), or you must argue that there is no general/sane rule under which the individual parts of the system are consistent.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And for all the others who want to abolish didSet and willSet completely:<br>&gt; NO WAY! they are both useful and I even used them for real code. For example, from code in my bachelors thesis (it&#39;s about polygons):<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     public var points: Array&lt;CGPoint&gt; = [] {<br>&gt;         didSet {<br>&gt;             _area = nil<br>&gt;             _centroid = nil<br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I want to cache the _area and _centroid of a polygon, because I&#39;m going to use it many many times more often than I change points. I would have to rewrite that code to something like<br>&gt;<br>&gt;     private var _points: Array&lt;CGPoint&gt; = []<br>&gt;     public var points {<br>&gt;         get {<br>&gt;             return _points<br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;         set {<br>&gt;             _area = nil<br>&gt;             _centroid = nil<br>&gt;             _points = newValue<br>&gt;         }<br>&gt;     }<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That&#39;s not better, and it probably breaks the COW-optimization of the underlying array.

Otherwise I&#39;d rather keep them as-is.<br></p><p>At some point (I think it was during the bike shedding for associatedtype), somebody declared that camel case for keywords is abhorrent and everybody accepted it without question. Looking back on it, I think that was a mistake. The point of camel case is to help resolve the individual words in an identifier. I don’t see why that shouldn’t also apply to keywords, especially as, in the list above, Apple Mail kept inserting spaces into the ones that weren’t in camel case, which is really annoying.<br></p><p>A better convention might be to put keywords in ALL CAPS like in Algol. &lt;&lt; Ducks &gt;&gt;<br></p><p>&gt; <br>&gt; On 18 May 2016 at 17:38, Michael Peternell via swift-evolution<br>&gt; &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt; Hi Erica,<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; &quot;didset&quot; and &quot;willset&quot; are outliers in the general rule that when combining multiple words into an identifier, that you should use camelCase. which rule is more important? I&#39;d like to introduce a third rule: don&#39;t fix it if it isn&#39;t broken, or more mildly: if in doubt, keep it the way it is. or another one: embrace precedent.. &quot;@IBOutlet&quot; is also not all-lowercase, should it be changed too? I&#39;d say no, because in objc it is called &quot;IBOutlet&quot; as well. Also, for my Apple Mail client, &quot;didset&quot; and &quot;willset&quot; are marked as typos, but &quot;didSet&quot; and &quot;willSet&quot; is okay :)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; =&gt; I vote for &quot;didSet&quot; and &quot;willSet&quot;.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I think we should be more careful when trying to argue with &quot;consistency&quot;. It sounds objective, when in reality it&#39;s often very subjective, because Immanuel Kant&#39;s imperative is ambiguous ;) there are multiple ways to be consistent. If you are saying that something is inconsistent, you either assert a specific rule of consistency (like &quot;keywords are always lowercase&quot;), or you must argue that there is no general/sane rule under which the individual parts of the system are consistent.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; And for all the others who want to abolish didSet and willSet completely:<br>&gt;&gt; NO WAY! they are both useful and I even used them for real code. For example, from code in my bachelors thesis (it&#39;s about polygons):<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;    public var points: Array&lt;CGPoint&gt; = [] {<br>&gt;&gt;        didSet {<br>&gt;&gt;            _area = nil<br>&gt;&gt;            _centroid = nil<br>&gt;&gt;        }<br>&gt;&gt;    }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; I want to cache the _area and _centroid of a polygon, because I&#39;m going to use it many many times more often than I change points. I would have to rewrite that code to something like<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;    private var _points: Array&lt;CGPoint&gt; = []<br>&gt;&gt;    public var points {<br>&gt;&gt;        get {<br>&gt;&gt;            return _points<br>&gt;&gt;        }<br>&gt;&gt;        set {<br>&gt;&gt;            _area = nil<br>&gt;&gt;            _centroid = nil<br>&gt;&gt;            _points = newValue<br>&gt;&gt;        }<br>&gt;&gt;    }<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; That&#39;s not better, and it probably breaks the COW-optimization of the underlying array. (And don&#39;t tell me that my design is bad because I use &quot;didSet&quot;, I really don&#39;t think so.)<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; -Michael<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Am 18.05.2016 um 17:09 schrieb Erica Sadun via swift-evolution &lt;swift-evolution at swift.org&gt;:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt;&gt; didSet and willSet remain outliers in the general rule of conjoined lowercase keywords.
